                <p>Sean took a moment to think it over. Leyla already had a place lined up, so she wasn&#39;t exactly on his list of immediate concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting more time, he changed direction and made his way toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, she was in the middle of a call with Seth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, you won&#39;t believe this. The Clarke family just sent the payment-way more than I expected. Didn&#39;t you say you were done working with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana was not in the mood for a long explanation.&#34;I was already over there. Figured I might as well turn the trip into profit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth had learned a long time ago that trying to decode her motives was a waste of energy. &#34;Well,whatever the reason, they went all out this time.Want to guess the amount?&#34; &#34;Go on. Shock me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten million. That&#39;s the highest consultation fee l&#39;ve ever seen cross our account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s face didn&#39;t shift in the slightest. The Clarkes were loaded, and she knew it. Most clients paid less not because they lacked money, but because,once their illness was gone, so was their need for her.Miguel,though-he was buying himself extra years.That ten million covered today&#39;s treatment and reserved her services for the same time next year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wire it to me. I&#39;ve got a string of big expenses coming up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, put the Pearson family on your radar. I want details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Pearsons? We&#39;re talking about the Pearson family in Eighvale, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Find out what they&#39;ve got going on.&#34; People had been whispering that the Pearson family was planning to move part of their Eighvale fortune into Qidence. With the Onyx Syndicate staking its own claim there, they couldn&#39;t afford to ignore one of the most established powerhouses in the region.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time they operated in Eighvale, they&#39;d bled money thanks to another influential family circling like vultures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t eager to make the Pearson family an enemy if there was any way to avoid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll dig into it and send everything I find straightto your inbox,&#34; said Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana answered with a short hum and was just lowering the phone when a large hand reached in and plucked it neatly from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reflexes flared, but they eased the moment she recognized the man in front of her. &#34;Sean? What are you doing here? I thought Mom told you to stay home and think about how you screwed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury hardened Sean&#39;s face. &#34;If I&#39;d actually done what Mom said and stayed home, you might&#39;ve put this family in the ground before we even knew what hit us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between Eliana&#39;s brows.&#34;You&#39;re going to have to explain that. When exactly have I ever done anything to hurt my own family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, the Murray household wasn&#39;t justa place she stayed-it was her home. The people in it were hers to protect, not harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;Drop the act. You&#39;re upset because I called you out earlier, right? So you run to the Clarke family-our enemies-playing the role of some skilled doctor just to stir trouble for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze narrowed, suspicion curling at the edges. &#34;This coming from Leyla, I assume?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave her out of it. She&#39;s not your punching bag.Leyla came to me because she&#39;s worried about you.Do you even understand what picking a fight with the Clarke family means? That&#39;s a straight shot to getting us all wiped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth settled in Eliana&#39;s mind. A cold, sharp laugh slid past her lips. &#34;So Leyla&#39;s out there telling people I&#39;m faking being a skilled doctor? Did she also mention the part where the Clarkes threw her out?That fallout wasn&#39;t on me-it was all hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s anger hit like a storm. &#34;Stop pretending you&#39;re innocent! Do you even understand the mess you&#39;ve made?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling the truth. If you doubt me, ask the Clarkes yourself. Right now, I need to get back and prepare Mom&#39;s medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere.&#34; His hand shot out,clamping around her wrist. &#34;You&#39;re coming with me to face the Clarkes and apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on his, steady and unflinching.&#34;And if | decide not to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t get to decide!&#34; he exclaimed, yanking her toward the estate&#39;s gates. A quick twist of Eliana&#39;s arm broke his hold. That only fueled Sean&#39;s fury. He lunged to grab her again, but she was already gone-slipping out of reach before his fingers could close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed forward, teeth clenched, but the street between them clogged with traffic. In the blink of an eye, she was on the other side, swallowed by the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A taxi rolled into view at just the right moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stepped forward, flagged it down, and slid inside without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Sean had dodged through the crush of traffic and reached the curb, Eliana was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; The curse tore from him as his gaze swept the street. She was like water slipping through his fingers. Did she have any clue that dragging her to the Clarkes wasn&#39;t just about protecting the Murray name? It was also the only way to shield her from the Clarkes&#39; backlash. With no real allies of her own-and with the Murray family losing influence-crossing the Clarke family could end badly. If they learned she&#39;d been posing as a famed doctor, there wNould be no saving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean spun on his heel, climbed into his car, and took off after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Tristan was wrapping up a business talk with Jeffry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their latest project meant the Pearson Group could offer favorable terms to the Clarkes-an opportunity Jeffry clearly recognized as a windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the ink dried on the contract, Tristan made his way to see MiguJel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel appeared lively despite his slight frame,carrying none of the visible weight of illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a relief to see you back on your feet,&#34; Tristan said, his voice carrying a rare note of ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel&#39;s grin was genuine. Too much time had passed since he&#39;d last felt like himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lllness had left him dependent on others for even the smallest tasks-a state that gnawed at dignity. Now,he could stand on his own again, and that meant everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m grateful you came. If there&#39;s ever something you need in Qidence, I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s done,&#34; Miguel replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words carried the shape of gratitude, but little else. People rarely acted without self-interest. Just as Miguel&#39;s vow to help Eliana wasn&#39;t born from pure goodwill-without the need for her skills next year,the Clarke family wouldn&#39;t waste a smile on someone wearing threadbare clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let the hollow courtesy pass. With a brief nod and a faint smile, he left a generous stack of gifts and took his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the car, Rocco glanced over from behind the wheel, eyes bright with anticipation. &#34;I&#39;ve got one piece of good news and one piece of bad news. Which should I start with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shut the project folder with deliberate care.&#34;Maybe I&#39;ll grow another ear so you can give me both at the same time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab slid right off Rocco&#39;s grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People often called Tristan hard to approach, but those who knew him well understood the truth-so long as no one crossed his boundaries, his temper stayed in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s grin widened as he broke the silence. &#34;I&#39;ll start with the good news. That woman you had me tracking? We finally caught a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, something real flickered across Tristan&#39;s controlled expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was steady, but there was weight beneath it.&#34;You found her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See for yourself.&#34; Rocco passed him a tablet, the screen frozen on a still from old surveillance footage. The shot showed a woman swathed in an oversized bath towel, her face turned just enough to reveal part of her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quality was grainy, the outline of her profile little more than a suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We pulled this from security footage at the resort-about a year back,&#34; Rocco explained. &#34;Most of it was useless, but this frame gave us at least a partial view.Blurry or not, it&#39;s the first real lead we&#39;ve had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tristan wasn&#39;t hearing the details. His gaze locked on that faint, indistinct side profile, and he didn&#39;t look away.</p>
