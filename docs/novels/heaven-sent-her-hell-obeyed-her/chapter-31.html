                <p>Crowds swirled through the shopping mall, voices and footsteps blending into a restless hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal pushed his way through without a hint of apology,barreling down the escalator two steps at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana trailed after him, careful with each step so she wouldn&#39;t bump into anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she had assumed Janessa had sold her off withouut him knowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the truth felt heavier. Neal had known all along,and she suspected it might have been his scheme from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the mall, she chased him down until he ducked into a narrow alley, where she finally caught up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned frost-cold, and her voice carried a quiet edge. &#34;Neal, what&#39;s got you running like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana? You&#39;re actually here?&#34; He blinked as if shocked to see her. Then his eyes swept over her face with a look that turned her stomach. &#34;Damn. I wasn&#39;t sure at first, but yeah, it&#39;s you. You&#39;ve changed..prettier than I remember. Life in Eighvale must&#39;ve been sweet. Bet the men there spoiled you rotten. So,what&#39;s next? You setting your sights on Qidence now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a dry laugh. &#34;Word is you&#39;re tying the knot with some wealthy Qidence socialite. So which is it,Neal? Planning to live off her money or aiming for full-time gigolo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; The words caught in his throat as he shot her a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as quickly, he chuckled and shrugged. &#34;Still got that sharp mouth, huh? That&#39;s always been your problem. Men prefer women who know how to be gentle and compliant. Still, if you&#39;re ready to be different, I wouldn&#39;t object to being with you again.I&#39;m a man after all, so does it really matter who you end up with? Whatever another man could offer, I can match it-and more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal&#39;s voice carried an almost believable edge, as though he meant every word. If she agreed to stay with him, he could spare her life. Killing her wasn&#39;t necessary-not when her beauty was enough to cloud his judgment. The fact she&#39;d been with other men didn&#39;t matter; he could let that slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes burned with contempt. &#34;You? Worthy of me? Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34; Another word from him felt like poison in her ears; she refused to listen to any more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance, she fixed him with a stare as cold as steel. &#34;Let&#39;s settle the score once and for all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal didn&#39;t even flinch, as if her threat was nothing worth taking seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than step back, he moved forward, smirking as though this was some kind of game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his foot landed forward, Eliana&#39;s hand shot out, twisting into his collar. She yanked him forward and slammed his head into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull, heavy crack rang through the narrow space.Neal staggered, pain flashing so sharp it nearly knocked him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something warm trickled down his face; when his fingers brushed it, they came away red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You crazy bitch! You&#39;re asking for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was furious, ignoring the pain in his head,he lunged at Eliana. But he never even grazed her. Her foot came up in a clean, brutal kick that sent him airborne.He slammed against the opposite wall and dropped,coughing blood, his body too spent to rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a shred of mercy, Eliana closed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Malice poured off her like heat from a flame, and she looked every bit the bringer of retribution. &#34;The moment you guys sold me, Neal, did you ever picture yourself dying at my hands?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flared in Neal&#39;s eyes. The strength Eliana displayed was far beyond anything he&#39;d imagined.When he caught the glint of cold intent in her gaze,a thin thread of fear coiled in his chest. &#34;H-Hold on...what are you planning to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you before-today, we settle the score once and for all.&#34; The metal in her hand caught the dim light, glinting like a promise of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killing him wasn&#39;t the goal. Death was a mercy. She preferred the kind of punishment that left someone wishing for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ideas flashed in her mind-endless ways to strip Neal of peace,piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the threat closing in, Neal turned and ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the alley&#39;s walls caged him in, trapping him like a cornered rat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help! Somebody-help!&#34; His voice cracked, and sweat slicked his forehead. It had never crossed his mind that Eliana could push him this far. What ir the hell had she picked up during her years in Eighvalle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her footsteps closed the distance until only a few strides remained. Then he spotted dark silhouettes at the alley&#39;s mouth-men in black coats. They had arrived! The Vulture Brotherhood had finally showed up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief surged through him as he waved frantically &#34;Over here! I&#39;m the one who called! Take this lunatic down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the entrance, Niko strode forward with the four at his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Neal&#39;s shout, Niko jerked his chin, signaling his men to rush Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps pounded closer, and Eliana turned to see four men charging at her, her eyes narrowing with a dangerous edge. So this was Neal&#39;s plan-lure her here,box her in, and finish her. His scheming was sharper than most gave him credit for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she was no easy prey-anyone aiming to harm her had better think twice about whether they were up to the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could make her move, her gaze drifted  past the four men and locked on the figure standing behind them. Her steps slowed. Wasn&#39;t Niko one of Leroy&#39;s men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition struck Niko at the same instant, and his eyes widened as though he had seen a ghost.Hertha?No...not again. The new order he&#39;d received had been to catch her alive. Was that bastard trying to start trouble, or just throwing them to the wolves?Memories hit like a punch-how Leroy had nearly killed him over this woman before. He had survived only by groveling and bowing until his knees ached.One wrong move now and Leroy wouldn&#39;t bother giving him another chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold it!&#34; Niko barked, raising a hand to halt his crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal, clueless about the tangled history between the Vulture Brotherhood and Eliana, snapped in frustration,&#34;What&#39;s the matter with you? Don&#39;t just stand there-grab her! I&#39;ll make it worth your while!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments earlier, he&#39;d been weighing whether to keep Eliana alive and under his thumb, but that thought had died the moment she&#39;d nearly ended him. Any softness toward her had turned to pure hatred. Now,only her death would satisfy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet before his rage could spill further, Niko stepped past his men, lowered his head, and bent into a deep bow before Eliana. &#34;Good day,Hertha.&#34; Neal was dumbfounded. Hertha? What was that? His gaze darted between them. Was the man addressing Eliana? Did he actually know her? The realization left him dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on Eliana&#39;s lips as she folded her arms. &#34;Fancy running into you again, Niko. Last time you came for my home-this time, you aiming for my head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beaded at his temple, and he let out a strained laugh. &#34;Please don&#39;t say that. We&#39;d never dare.I swear,we had no idea it was you... If we had, we wouldn&#39;t have wasted a second on this fool. Please, overlook our mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth curved in a slow, knowing smile. &#34;Mistakes born of ignorance don&#39;t count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over him, and he straightened a little.&#34;Still, this idiot had the guts to pay us to kidnap you.That&#39;s asking for death. If you&#39;ll allow it, we&#39;ll deal with him right now and make sure he understands how stupid he&#39;s been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana raised her eyebrows,agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting her hands on Neal felt like touching something filthy-better to let others do the work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her silence as permission, Niko signaled his men and began moving in on Neal</p>
