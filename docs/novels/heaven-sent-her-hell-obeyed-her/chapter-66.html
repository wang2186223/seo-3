                <p>Frieda had never once treated Rocco with an ounce of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curling her lip, she scoffed disdainfully, &#34;So tell me-what exactly do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s voice came back steady and cold.	&#34;An apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, everyone who had doubted Eliana&#39;s identity had already offered their apologies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the very one who had started the whole mess-Frieda-refused to show the slightest hint of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for her deliberate provocation, no one would have questioned who Eliana was in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his demand, Frieda let out a sharp laugh dripping with scorn. &#34;You think you can force me to apologize?For what, exactly? I didn&#39;t do anything wrong.Everyone else doubted Eliana was Riley at the beginning,too. Now the truth&#39;s out-end of story. As for you, you&#39;re not qualified to make me apologize!Get the hell out of my way before I completely snap!&#34; Rocco&#39;s brows drew tight with disgust. He had never encountered a woman so outrageously shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred up chaos, refused to apologize, and carried herself as though she wasn&#39;t the one at fault. How could she show such appalling audacity? The fury building in his chest pushed him to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could, a deep, cutting voice slid from behind him. &#34;He might not have the right to demand an apology-so what about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco spun at once. Tristan stood there, gaze locked on Frieda, his face hard as carved stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda whipped toward the voice, only to meet Tristan&#39;s glacial stare. Her blood seemed to drain in an instant, her palms dampening with a nervous sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she had ever been this close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the moment was nothing like the dazzling encounter she had once dreamed of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan up close was no longer the man who once made her pulse race-he was a figure that sent a shiver of dread down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were like shards of ice, and the weight of his gaze made her throat tighten. She instinctively swallowed the lump in her throat,her voice quaking as she stammered a greeting, &#34;Mr.Pearson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, she had fantasized about speaking to him face-to-face. Now that it had come true,her tongue felt clumsy, and her fear stole the rest of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan advanced, his polished shoes clicking softly against the floor, and stopped just half a step from her. &#34;I&#39;ll ask you this-he may not have the right to demand an apology, but do l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being confronted by the man she had admired for so long left Frieda humiliated, more so because he was openly defending Eliana-the woman she loathed most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fear twisted into resentment, burning hot beneath her skin, and she forced out a shaky protest. &#34;Mr.Pearson,I...I admit I might&#39;ve spoken too harshly, but ...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shut her down harshly, unwilling to tolerate even a shred of her excuses. &#34;I&#39;ll make this simple.You either apologize to Eliana on your own,or I&#39;ll have my men pin you down until you beg for her forgiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s complexion turned ghostly white, though she  forced herself to feign composure. &#34;Mr. Pearson,perhaps you don&#39;t know who I am. My dad owns the Larson Group. I&#39;ve heard your Pearson Group is interested in partnering with our Larson Group on a major project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin smile curved Tristan&#39;s lips, cold and humorless.&#34;Oh, so you&#39;re a Larson. In that case, go home and tell your dad the deal is off,&#34; he declared sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s heart lurched violently-she hadn&#39;t expected him torisk a business alliance for Eliana&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her family&#39;s interests on the line, she had no choice but to choke down her pride. Biting her lip,she choked the words out. &#34;I&#39;ll apologize. Please don&#39;t cancel the collaboration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan offered no reply, his jaw tight as he flicked his chin toward Eliana, ordering Frieda to apologize without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension drained from Frieda&#39;s shoulders as relief set in.She loathed the thought of bowing her head, but her family&#39;s interests outweighed her own pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Tristan&#39;s glacial stare, she forced her steps toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, drained from fending off waves of insincere apologies all day, instinctively furrowed her brows when Frieda drew near. &#34;What now?&#34; she asked, her  tone edged with weariness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That impatient look nearly made Frieda snap, but she swallowed her fury. Grinding her teeth, she forced the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I judged you wrongly before. I... apologize. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow arched, genuine surprise flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clearly hadn&#39;t imagined Frieda would ever lower her head so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flicker of Tristan&#39;s gaze brushed the edge of her vision, and in that instant, Eliana grasped the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your apology-I don&#39;t want it. From now on,stay the hell away from me. I don&#39;t ever want you in my sight again,&#34; she stated with a casual shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark made Frieda&#39;s face twist with bitterness.How on earth could Eliana dismiss her even after she&#39;d forced herself to apologize?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Frieda could snap back, an icy shiver crawled up her spine. She didn&#39;t have to turn around to know Tristan&#39;s eyes were still on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing down her fury, she inhaled sharply and said through clenched teeth, &#34;I understand. I spoke out of turn earlier. I&#39;ll take my leave now.&#34; Not daring to linger another second, she hurried out of the exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked in with confidence, but left carrying nothing but humiliation and defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Frieda walked out, Tristan signaled Doran to clear the gawkers before striding over to Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said with a teasing glint, &#34;I didn&#39;t realize you were not only a famed doctor but also a celebrated artist.You&#39;ve managed to surprise me again. Makes me wonder how many more secrets you&#39;re keeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips Together Eliana remarked, &#34;There&#39;s more than you can imagine that you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his mouth. &#34;Is that so? Then I&#39;ll enjoy uncovering those little mnysteries one at a time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze hardened as she countered, &#34;Don&#39;t waste your time. Once I&#39;ve repaid what I owe you, there won&#39;t be anything left between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured at that, though he quickly shifted the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your wish to stay out of the spotlight.I&#39;ve already made it clear to the others that your identity is not to be discussed. No one here will mention Riley.&#34; Relief washed over her, tempered by the uncomfortable awareness that she was now indebted to him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her unease, he said smoothly, &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself over that. I won&#39;t be collecting on this favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyebrows drew together as the words slipped out.&#34;And what exactly do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing at all,&#34; Tristan replied smoothly. &#34;The exhibition&#39;s about to begin. Come on-time for you to step into your role as my date. A few of the guests l invited are eager to meet you.&#34; He offered his arm with a practiced gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let his words hang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to close to a man who already had a girlfriend wasn&#39;t something she&#39;d tolerate, and linking arms with him felt far too intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed rooted beside him, refusing the offer without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t push the matter. Instead, he strode toward the conference hall, and she followed in step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Davin and Larry instinctively made to trail after. But Tristan caught their movement, his eyes flicking toward Rocco in silent command.He had no intention of letting anyone else hover too close-especially when it came to Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco grasped the intention immediately, raising a hand to halt them. &#34;Stay put. The exhibition&#39;s about to officially open, and I&#39;d like everyone ready for the upcoming oil painting competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin barely cared about the contest anymore. His eyes lit up as he blurted, &#34;Everything&#39;s already in place.I just want a quick word with my teacher...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t often he ran into her, and countless questions pressed at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Larry, sharper than his companion, noticed Tristan leading Eliana away himself.Interrupting now would be reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly  tugged Davin back and insisted, &#34;Mr.Gordon, Riley isn&#39;t leaving just yet. Let&#39;s get through the competition first-I still need to go over the final judging plan with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for more protest, he steered Davin firmly into the private room behind the main exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Leyla reappeared in the main hall,  freshly touched up after her trip to the restroom.</p>
