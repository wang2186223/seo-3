                <p>Explaining that she&#39;d only been helping Tristan getting rid of unwanted admirer felt unnecessary, so Eliana put on a mock frown instead. &#34;Were you actually looking for me earlier? Because from where I stood,it looked,like you were far too busy admiring the paintings here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s trusting nature made him falter immediately under her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing the back of his head, he blurted out, &#34;I swear,I was searching for you the whole time! I just happened to pass by that piece, and it caught my eye.I stopped for a moment-just a few seconds-to appreciate it. Then I was going to keep looking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the genuine worry in his face, Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m teasing you. I&#39;m not upset. But now you&#39;ve got me curious-what sort of painting could hold your attention like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension left Carl&#39;s shoulders as he explained, &#34;It&#39;s the work of an artist I really admire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, Eliana leaned slightly to glance past him. One look was all it took to recognize the piece-her own creation, &#34;Rubble Corner&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered clearly how someone had once reached out to the Onyx Syndicate to commission a painting from Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The price had been too good to ignore, so she had accepted and painted this herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had she imagined it would end up displayed here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought slipped in uninvited-could Tristan have been the one who placed that order? He had once said he liked her art. Maybe that hadn&#39;t been flattery at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she was letting her thoughts drift toward Tristan again,she pulled herself back sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he was already involved with someone, and she had nothing but disdain for that woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Becoming part of that equation was something she would never allow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the thought entirely, Eliana turned back to Carl. &#34;If you&#39;re that fond of it, I&#39;ll give you a Riley painting of your own.&#34;  Carl was taken aback. &#34;You own his work? Those are worth a fortune! How in the world did you get one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricking Carl never required much effort, so Eliana spun a story without hesitation. &#34;Riley once visited my village for inspiration, and I practically begged for a personal piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes went wide. &#34;Wait-Riley actually agreed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, she&#39;s talented, generous and stunning.&#34;Eliana nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stunning? And you said &#39;she&#39;? Hold on, I thought Riley was some old man!&#34; Carl exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old man? No. She&#39;s a gorgeous young woman,&#34;Eliana replied smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re serious? She&#39;s a young man?&#34; Carl drew in a sharp breath, then leaned closer. &#34;Does she have a boyfriend? Think I might have a shot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made Eliana inwardly wince.She should have told him that she was Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regretted lying to Carl now, as covering it up was just too troublesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana could only vaguely reply, &#34;Don&#39;t even think about it, Carl. She&#39;s already engaged.&#34; His face fell for a moment before lighting up again.&#34;Well, either way, thanks, Lia. Once you&#39;ve got that painting,you must give it to me! Or I can buy it-either works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana waved the offer away. &#34;Forget about paying me.I&#39;m no art collector, so I&#39;ll just hand it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks!&#34; Carl&#39;s grin spread from ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to thank me for. Didn&#39;t you give me a whole factory?&#34; Eliana reminded him with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s different. Taking care of you is what I should be doing. I am your brother, after all,&#34; Carl said with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved further, a quiet warmth blooming in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments like this reminded her exactly how different the Murray family was from Janessa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Janessa&#39;s eyes, nothing Eliana did-no matter the effort or sacrifice-was ever considered a gift. It was simply what she owed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Janessa demanded Eliana&#39;s very life, she was expected to hand it over without protest. The Murray family could not have been more different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eliana ever asked for their lves, she knew they would give them freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto that thought, she softened her voice.&#34;We&#39;re family. There&#39;s no need for formal words-that would only make us strangers. But I do have something I need your help with right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? Just tell me, I&#39;ll handle it!&#34; Carl replied without missing a beat, his eagerness plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer, motioning for him to comenearer,and murmured her request in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was for him to take part in the day&#39;s oil painting competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the slightest pause, Carl nodded.&#34;Consider it done! If you want first place, I&#39;ll win it for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never once shown his work to the public, but if Eliana asked, there was nothing he wouldn&#39;t do-not even step into a competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host&#39;s voice rang out across the exhibition hall.&#34;The charity auction is about to begin. Guests, please proceed to the conference hall.&#34; Eliana shook her head lightly and said, &#34;We&#39;re not going there, Carl. I&#39;ll take you to meet the curator so you can register for the competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Carl agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe would go anywhere she led him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same time, Leyla stepped out from the private room Hector had arranged for her and began making her way toward the conference hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway there,she crossed paths with Jeffry,who had come at Hector&#39;s request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry had been questioning Hector about the urgent matter that required him to rush over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his eyes landed on Leyla, his face darkened like a storm rolling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hisglare was sharp enough to cut. &#34;Tell me, Hector-did you drag me here just so I could see her? Did you conveniently forget everything I told you over the phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t dare...&#34; Hector replied quickly, trying to keep his tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph! Wouldn&#39;t dare? Sounds to me like you&#39;ve grown far too bold!&#34; Jeffry snapped,his temper flaring  as he turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector stepped forward to block him. &#34;Dad,wait-please don&#39;t go. Let me explain what actually happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to risk being cut off,he launched into a quick recounting of the day&#39;s events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he mentioned Davin taking Leyla on as a student, Jeffry&#39;s expression froze for a fraction of a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon agreed to mentor her? Are you telling the truth, or are you feeding me a lie?&#34; Jeffry demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For something like this, even if I wanted to lie, it wouldn&#39;t hold up for long,&#34; Hector said firmly.&#34;Besides, he is here today-you can ask him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the tension drained from Jeffry&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that,Hector continued, &#34;She didn&#39;t come with me today. Mr. Gordon brought her himself and recommended her for the oil painting competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry lifted his brows slightly, a silent signal for himn to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The winner,&#34; Hector explained, &#34;won&#39;t just get a hefty cash prize. They&#39;ll also become the chief designer for the new product logo for the Pearson Group&#39;s  Qidence branch. Leyla says she&#39;s confident she&#39;ll take the top spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scowl melted from Jeffry&#39;s face, replaced by something far more neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this turned out to be true, he figured Leyla might not be as worthless as he&#39;d assumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing the chief designer position would mean the Clarke family could strengthen its relationship with the Pearsons without much effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, his gaze drifted to Leyla,standing a short distance away. At last, he motioned her forward. &#34;Get over here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Summoning her composure, Leyla stepped closer and greeted him politely. &#34;Hi, Mr. Clarke...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry gave a brief nod before asking, &#34;Hector tells me you&#39;re confident you can win the championship.Is that so?&#34;-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I&#39;ll put everything I have into it,&#34; Leyla answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry raised an eyebrow. &#34;Then I&#39;ll give you the opportunity to prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s chest tightened with excitement. &#34;I appreciate it! I promise I&#39;ll take the championship!&#34; Jeffry remained silent after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, victory would have to be earned-it wasn&#39;t something that could be guaranteed with empty promises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, word reached Tristan that Jeffry had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ordered Rocco to escort Jeffry to a front-row seat in the conference hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a personal greeting, but it was still a gesture of considerable respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the only person Tristan had chosen to greet in person that day was Eliana.</p>
