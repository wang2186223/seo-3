                <p>Seth&#39;s arms were folded so tightly across his chest, he looked like he was holding himself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t fooled by his rigid stance. &#34;Drop the act.&#34; She leaned back against the desk, her gaze sharp.&#34;Out of everyone, you&#39;re the last person who&#39;d ever be afraid of me. So why don&#39;t you quit pretending and tell me-why did you hack into Tristan&#39;s firewall?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from his face. His lips parted but no sound came out. &#34;Who told you that?&#34; he finally asked,voice hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d made it clear-no one was to breathe a word of the incident to Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wound was hers to carry, and he refused to let anyone tear it open again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t been for her, he wouldn&#39;t even be alive. Her stepfather&#39;s wrath would have beaten him straight into the grave. But she had stood up for him, shielding him like a sister would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon told me.&#34; Her gaze didn&#39;t waver. &#34;If he hadn&#39;t, would you have kept it from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth stiffened. He had never revealed to Damon whose firewall he wanted to breach. If Damon had found out, it wasn&#39;t because someone had told him-it was because he had uncovered it himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which meant his skills weren&#39;t just advanced. They were terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, a little too quickly. &#34;I wasn&#39;t trying to keep anything from you, honestly. It&#39;s just... this came as a client&#39;s request.&#34; He hesitated, eyes flicking over her face before he added, softer, &#34;But I&#39;ve been hearing things. About you and Tristan getting closer. And I worried you&#39;d let feelings get in the way-that you wouldn&#39;t take this order if you knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;I know my priority when it comes to men and money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard. &#34;I believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. &#34;Then tell me the truth. Who placed the order? And what was in the footage file they wanted gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One lie had a way of birthing a hundred more. Seth understood that now-too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once he&#39;d set foot on this path, there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth felt like a blade waiting to fall, andall he could do was stall for time. The longer Eliana remained in the dark, the safer she was... or so he told himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a steadying breath, Seth forced the name past his lips.&#34;Jared Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent. Eliana visibly turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jared&#39;s name hung in the air like poison. In the Onyx Syndicate, it had long been a taboo-a past no one dared bring up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s jaw tightened. Of course Seth had wanted to keep it from her. Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting her palms, but her voice was ice-cold when she finally spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From now on, don&#39;t take any more orders from him. This is the last time.&#34; She decided not to press further about the firewall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood!&#34; Seth answered quickly, straightening as though her tone jolted him to attention. Relief washed through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least he&#39;d had the sense to use Jared&#39;s name. Anyone else, and she would&#39;ve kept digging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still... guilt pinched at him. Because invoking Jared also reopened the very wound Eliana had fought so hard to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Jared had been her everything-her lover, her future. Everyone had expected their wedding. Until he&#39;d thrown her aside like an old coat, chasing ambition into another woman&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s subordinates had sworn vengeance, eager to make Jared pay. But Eliana had stopped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, his name was scrubbed from their world, as though he&#39;d never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, under the flicker of workshop light, Eliana&#39;s mask of calm couldn&#39;t hide the storm in her eyes.Seth swallowed hard.He regretted mentioning Jared... but at the same time, he didn&#39;t. At least it ended her questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to steer her away from the shadows, he forced a smile. &#34;I&#39;ve got a surprise for you.Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on him for a heartbeat, then she blinked, pulling herself back from memories that threatened to consume her. With a faint nod, she followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abandoned factory had four workshops in total.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped into Workshop D. The air smelled faintly of dust and cement. At the center, a gaping pit stretched over seven feet deep, its edges jagged under the dim lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stopped short. &#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth grinned, pride lighting his face. &#34;I thought our headquarters on the surface was too easy to spot. So, I had the men dig an underground space. Once the rooms are done, we&#39;ll disguise the top as a dye factory.Even if anyone snoops around, all they&#39;ll see is harmless industry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s nodded approvingly. &#34;That&#39;s a good idea. But keep the noise down. We don&#39;t want to draw attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. Leave it to me! In under a month, our underground headquarters will be ready,&#34; Seth said with conviction, his voice brimming with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana nodded again, patting him lightly on the shoulder. &#34;You&#39;ve all worked hard. Treat yourselves to a proper meal tonight-put it on my tab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks!&#34; Seth and the others cheered in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Eliana&#39;s lips before she glanced at the time.getting late. I should head back now.Keep me updated if anything comes up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Seth nodded respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging goodbyes, Eliana hang around-she left for her home. Under the starlit sky, the sprawling manor estate silent and grand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she had done every night, she moved quietly into Damon&#39;s room. She lit a faintly sweet-scented candle,switched on the lamp, and began tending to his legs with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she finished, it was already past two in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed into her pajamas and lay down on her bed, but sleep refused to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth&#39;s earlier words echoed in her mind-Jared. She had done her best to bury every memory of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of him reopened old wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jared, with his promises. He had said he would make her happy, that he would love her just as he always had-but he could not marry her. He had begged for her understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she hadn&#39;t understood. How could she? She would never become the shameful shadow in another woman&#39;s marriage. And so, she had walked away, outwardly decisive, but bleeding within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana closed her eyes. A single hot tear slid down her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone vibrated beneath the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened. Who could be texting her at this hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling it out, she saw Tristan&#39;s name flash across the screen. His text read, &#34;Are you asleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted. What was he thinking, reaching out to her at this time of night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could put the phone aside, another message appeared. &#34;I need to talk to you. Come to my office tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana pressed her lips into a thin line. With deliberate calm, she powered off the phone, set it aside, and lit another candle, this one infused with sleep-inducing herbs. Slowly, at last, her body relaxed and drifted into slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Tristan&#39;s face was thunderous. The air in the room seemed to crackle with his fury, heavy enough to suffocate. Rocco and Doran stood stiffly before him, their heads lowered, neither daring to make the slightest sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s temper was infamous, but tonight, his rage was something else entirely. They had never seen him that furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their firewall was breached. The surveillance footage they had worked so hard to recover had been destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One more night and the file would have been restored to high definition. But now...ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men shifted uneasily under Tristan&#39;s icy glare. Shame pressed down on them like a weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had always boasted their firewall was impenetrable, flawless-yet now, that illusion had shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The failure was more than technical. It was personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched, suffocating, until Tristan finally spoke-his voice low and measured. &#34;Find out who wanted to destroy that file.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco nodded quickly, almost stumbling over his words. &#34;We&#39;Il track them down. There aren&#39;t many hackers with skills this advanced-we&#39;ll narrow it down fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Tristan cut in coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; Both men bowed their heads and turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could cross the threshold, Rocco&#39;s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen-and his expression lit up with sudden relief. He rushed back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes narrowed, irritation flashing across his face. &#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good news,&#34; Rocco said, breathless. &#34;Our team managed to back up the footage. The file&#39;s safe-it&#39;s preserved on a flash drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time that night, Tristan&#39;s expression shifted, the fury in his eyes cooling to a dangerous calm.&#34;At least someone on your team has some wit.&#34; Rocco seized the opening. &#34;We&#39;ll keep investigating the breach. And I&#39;ll have the team start restoring the file again immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned back, but his gaze remained razor sharp. &#34;This time,&#34; he said quietly, &#34;don&#39;t let me down.&#34;&#34;Understood!&#34; Rocco nodded with renewed vigor.</p>
