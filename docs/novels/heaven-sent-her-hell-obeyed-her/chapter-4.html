                <p>Carl slammed one of the copies of the agreement to sever family ties onto the floor in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, he had been convinced that Leyla was trouble, though the rest of the family refused to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, her own actions had spared him the trouble of proving it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still standing here? Weren&#39;t you desperate to leave? Then go!&#34; he said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, mocking laugh slipped from Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, she and Carl had never been on friendly terms, and there was no reason to keep up the act anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bending to retrieve the crumpled document,she met Carl&#39;s gaze with chilling resolve. &#34;Remember this moment, Carl. One day, you&#39;ll regret every choice you made today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her step faltered when she noticed Eliana watching from the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased her face upon seeing Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite wearing clothes that could not have been plainer, Eliana&#39;s face carried a kind of beauty that demanded notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the soft, quiet kind-it struck like a challenge, and Leyla felt an unease coil in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes sealed it. They mirrored Stella&#39;s in a way that left no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth clicked in Leyla&#39;s mind in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, letting her gaze sweep over Eliana. &#34;So, you must be the missing Eliana.&#34; moment, Carl. One day, you&#39;ll regret every choice you made today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her step faltered when she noticed Eliana watching from the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased her face upon seeing Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite wearing clothes that could not have been plainer, Eliana&#39;s face carried a kind of beauty that demanded notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the soft, quiet kind-it struck like a challenge, and Leyla felt an unease coil in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes sealed it. They mirrored Stella&#39;s in a way that left no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth clicked in Leyla&#39;s mind in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, letting her gaze sweep over Eliana. &#34;So, you must be the missing Eliana.&#34; Eliana&#39;s mouth curved into a thin, knowing smile.&#34;And you&#39;re the stray who bit the hand that fed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s temper snapped, her hand swinging upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the blow could land, Eliana&#39;s fingers clamped around her wrist, halting it in midair. A sharp pain shot through Leyla&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh-&#34; Leyla hissed. &#34;Let go, you bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like no one ever taught you manners. Leave now, before I lose my patience,&#34; Eliana warned coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let go of Leyla&#39;s wrist and wiped her palm against her pants as though she&#39;d touched something filthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes narrowed, and a bitter laugh broke from her lips. &#34;Oh, I get it now. You&#39;re just a carbon copy of the rest of your family. But don&#39;t think you&#39;ve come back to some comfortable life. The Murrays are sinking fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana responded, &#34;Maybe they are, maybe they&#39;re not. I&#39;m not sure. But I&#39;m sure of one thing: you&#39;ll be gone by the time I count to three.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a burst of anger, Leyla tried to lunge at her, but Carl stepped in, blocking her path. &#34;Throw her out!&#34;he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know the way! I never wanted to stay in this place.And you&#39;d all better remember-this isn&#39;t over.I&#39;ll make you pay for today,&#34; Leyla retorted with a cold glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had returned alone, and for now, retreating seemed the smarter move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she married into the Clarke family, she would find her chance to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl opened his mouth to hurl another insult but stopped short when Stella&#39;s body wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; he shouted, rushing forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blur of movement swept past him, and before he could blink, Eliana was there, arms around the fainting Stella. &#34;Lia...&#34; Carl stared in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me get her to her room,&#34; Eliana told him, her tone leaving no room for hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; he said, moving quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, Stella was settled in her bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana took a seat at the edge, her hands moving with careful precision as she examined her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for her to see that rage had pushed Stella past her limit. Beneath that, Stella&#39;s body was already fragile, weakened from old illnesses that had never fully healed. Without proper care, she might not withstand much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl had just told the butler to call for an ambulance when he noticed Eliana leaning over Stella, quietly assessing her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed his face. &#34;Lia, are you a doctor now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her tone casual, Eliana replied, &#34;Simply picked up a few tricks from a village healer. Do you have an acupuncture kit? She needs it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler stepped in before Carl could respond, his voice carrying a note of concern. &#34;I&#39;ve already called an ambulance. It&#39;ll arrive in about twenty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;By then, they&#39;ll put her on oxygen, run a list of tests, and hand her a bag of random pills before sending her back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking twice, Carl replied, &#34;Go to the therapy room. See if the therapist left any needles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That room had been stocked years ago for Louis,whose bad back demanded constant attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no room to argue, the butler left to look,muttering under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luck was on their side-though the therapist had been dismissed, the tools had been left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the butler returned with a small wooden case. Eliana flipped it open, laying out the silver needles in an orderly row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sterilized them with practiced movements before pressing them into several key points along Stella&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the final needle was in place, Stella&#39;s eyes stayed closed, her breathing unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing this, the butler tugged Carl a few steps away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Carl had always been the Murray child least suited for serious decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone else preoccupied by Louis&#39;s affairs,the butler felt the burden of keeping a level head-and stopping Carl from making a costly mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir...&#34; His voice dropped to a near whisper as his eyes flicked toward Eliana, saying, &#34;The young lady you brought home... is she really Eliana?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. Look at her eyes-they&#39;re the same as our mother&#39;s when she was young. And she&#39;s wearing the fish-shaped jade pendant our mother gave her before she disappeared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler gave a slow nod before continuing, &#34;While you were gone, we learned she was adopted by a rural family. Forgive me for saying so, but country people don&#39;t exactly have advanced medical training.The ambulance will be here any minute-it might be safer to take your mother to a top-tier hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re suggesting Lia could hurt our mom?&#34; Carl&#39;s tone sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; the butler said quickly. &#34;I&#39;m just considering the worst possibility. You saw it yourself -those needles didn&#39;t seem to change anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s direct nature carried him straight to Eliana&#39;s side. &#34;Lia, how much longer until she comes around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In about ten minutes,&#34; said Eliana, pressing the needle in with steady, deliberate force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure inside Stella needed to be eased gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl gave a brief nod, then looked over at the butler.&#34;We&#39;ll give it ten minutes. If she&#39;s still out, we&#39;re heading to the hospital. Relax. There are also skilled doctors in the countryside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze flicked toward the butler. &#34;She&#39;ll wake up.You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler forced a small, uneasy smile. &#34;Alright...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected Carl&#39;s words to be so blunt and without ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It explained why people claimed that, among the six sons of Louis and Stella, Carl was the plainest speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his nerves wound tighter, the wail of an ambulance floated up from the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ambulance is here!&#34; he blurted out. &#34;Let&#39;s get Mrs.Murray downstairs right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were barely out of his mouth when the door slammed open with a violent kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned toward the sudden intrusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man with strong brows and a scar cutting across his right one stood in the doorway. &#34;Carl, I heard Mom-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut off when his eyes locked on Eliana,who was pressing a long silver needle into Stella&#39;s head. His face instantly contorted with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you, and why are you hurting my mom? You&#39;ll have to go through me first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he swung his arm toward Eliana in a strike meant to land.</p>
