                <p>Eliana had no patience for pointless chatter with Frieda.&#34;I&#39;m busy and have no time to waste here,&#34; she said curtly, already turning to leave with Rocco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to the main exhibition hall to find Davin.Since she hadn&#39;t found him yet, she certainly wasn&#39;t going to waste energy sparring with Frieda</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted to point out Davin&#39;s flaws, she would do it directly to him, not through someone who had no stake in the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana&#39;s calm dismissal only fueled Frieda&#39;s suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She became certain that Eliana didn&#39;t understand art at all-merely pretending to know, and criticizing Davin&#39;s work for attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda even doubted Eliana could recognize Davin if she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana moved to walk off, Frieda wasn&#39;t about to let her go without a parting shot She grabbed Eliana&#39;s arm and barked, &#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere until you explain yourself-and apologize for your ignorance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana narrowed her eyes, ready to pull free, but Rocco stepped in first,prying Frieda&#39;s hand off her. &#34;Keep your hands to yourself!&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda had never seen him before-Rocco hadn&#39;t been at that welcome banquet that day-so she assumed he was Eliana&#39;s bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face tightened in annoyance. &#34;And who exactly do you think you are? How dare you lay a hand on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-&#34; Rocco began, but the words were cut short by a stir in the crowd</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon is here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he&#39;s arrivedl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s head snapped toward the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough,Davin was making his way into the hall,quickly surrounded by an eager crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people here were art lovers; Davin Gordon was a name that commanded respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgetting Rocco entirely, Frieda hurried toward him and called out loudly, &#34;Mr. Gordon! Someone here is insulting you and your work!&#34; Davin&#39;s brows drew together. He could take criticism -but not baseless insults. &#34;Who is it?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s her!&#34; Frieda pointed in Eliana&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he stood, Davin could only see the outline of a slim young woman-Rocco&#39;s tall frame blocked most of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh... the young lady,&#34;he said with a slight frown.&#34;She&#39;s still so young. She might know must about painting Forget it. I&#39;m not going to argue with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was turning to go when Eliana&#39;s voice cut across the space &#34;Your painting skills have regressed significantly&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Davin like a slap His face darkened.He hadn&#39;t heard Eliana&#39;s voice in years, so it didn&#39;t register immediately-but that phrase &#34;regressed significantly&#34; caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? And how exactly did you reach that conclusion,young lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda rounded on Eliana, her tone dripping with contempt. &#34;Mr. Gordon is asking you! Speak up! How dare you-someone who clearly knows nothing about art-criticize him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her angle, Eliana could see his face clearly.He  had aged in the two years since they&#39;d last met</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason alone, she didn&#39;t want to tear him down in public. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you privately,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hah!&#34; Frieda scoffed. &#34;You&#39;re bluffing. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s voice cut through her mockery. &#34;I welcome criticism from anyone.No need for privacy-go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he insisted, Eliana stepped toward one of his paintings. &#34;This landscape-you painted it recently,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin nodded. &#34;Last month. It&#39;s one of my proudest works. Let&#39;s hear your insight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze swept over the canvas, sharp and deliberate. &#34;At first glance, it&#39;s impressive. The mist drapes over the mountains beautifully, and the stream at the base balances the composition. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted her tone.&#34;The rockwork-while strong-lacks a natural grace.Here-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to the lower corner. &#34;These strokes feel forced, as if you were trying too hard to convey strength, and in doing so, you lost the natural ruggedness and spontaneity of the stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s face tightened. Frieda opened her mouth to fire back, but Davin&#39;s look silenced her. &#34;Let her continue,&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d noticed that exact flaw before. Hearing Eliana pinpoint it intrigued him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Frieda kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana went on, &#34;And here-the ripples. They look winding at first, but when you really look, the brushwork is too calculated. You&#39;ve trapped the water inside your own structure, when real water flows without restraint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each observation drew more hostility from the onlookers. They weren&#39;t opposed to hearing a critique -but coming from her? That was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does she know? Paintings are supposed to be precise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon, don&#39;t listen to her-she&#39;s clueless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. I&#39;ve followed your work for years. She&#39;s just spouting nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin ignored them entirely. At his level, true,unflinching feedback was rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few were bold enough. Riley gave it. And now.the young woman before him too. He was pleased that someone besides Riley could offer him suggestions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana raised a brow and finished, &#34;And the mist-it&#39;s too heavy-handed. You&#39;ve tried to force a dreamlike atmosphere, but mist should be fleeting, not smeared on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd bristled even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This painting was &#34;Mountain Mist&#34;. Without thick mist,what was it supposed to be? And it was displayed in the main hall-proof that the Pearson Group valued it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s this country girl from, thinking she can talk down to Mr. Gordon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s talking nonsense-none of it makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda was already bristling from Eliana&#39;s sharp,confident critique. So when the crowd started piling on her,Frieda jumped right in, snapping, &#34;What do you know about oil paintings, about landscapes, you little country bumpkin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Davin&#39;s voice cracked through the noise,sharp and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda froze. He was glaring at her-really glaring-  and her stomach gave a nervous twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon, I was just speaking up for you...&#34; she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you were,&#34; Davin said evenly, &#34;but the young lady is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. Right? He was saying Eliana was right? He wasn&#39;t angry at all? This was Davin Gordon-master of oil painting, a man people in the art world practically bowed to-and he was siding with a country girl who had just criticized him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda couldn&#39;t wrap her head around it.. Gordon,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Davin didn&#39;t let her finish. He simply turned away,cutting through the crowd with long strides until he was standing in front of Eliana.</p>
