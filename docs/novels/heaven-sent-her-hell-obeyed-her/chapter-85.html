                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved in an easy smile. &#34;Please don&#39;t underestimate me. For something this small, I don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl had always thought highly of her. When he&#39;d watched her kneel by the roadside and change a tire on her own, he&#39;d known she wasn&#39;t like most girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he knew she was Riley, he had even more reason not to doubt her. &#34;I&#39;m not underestimating you,&#34;he said, his brows drawing together, &#34;but this involves the Pearson family...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Murray family had never been on the same level as the Pearsons-and now, the gap was wider than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana simply patted his shoulder. &#34;Relax. I&#39;ve got my own way of handling it. Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl hesitated, then nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons he couldn&#39;t explain, he had a feeling there was nothing in this world she couldn&#39;t manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long,hurried footsteps approached.Jordy arrived, slightly out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Tristan&#39;s prior arrangements, he met no resistance-Doran personally led him straight to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges were already gathered in the meeting area, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, they were following Tristan back to the main exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan took the microphone from Rocco, then handed it to Davin. &#34;She&#39;s your student. You should announce it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s words landed like a weight in Davin&#39;s chest, making his heart ache. Clearing his throat, he stepped forward.&#34;Ladies and gentlemen...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowdstilled instantly. People pulled closer. Leyla stood poised, her chin lifted slightly, a confident smile playing on her lips. Finally. This was it-the moment she would be named the winner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a glance toward Carl. He met her eyes briefly before turning away with an expression of cold disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care what he thought. She&#39;d achieved exactly what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His opinion of her meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, his displeasure towards her was valid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spotlight meant for him was now on her. She&#39;d taken credit for his work, and for that, of course, he resented her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience leaned forward, anticipation buzzing through the air. This wasn&#39;t just a title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The champion would become the chief designer for Pearson Group&#39;s new project and be hailed as a rising star in the art world. Soon, their name would be known across the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s voice rang out. &#34;The outstanding winner of today&#39;s competition is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s heart thrummed with excitement. She straightened, already imagining the applause, the flood of congratulations, and Jeffry&#39;s proud words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect what came next. &#34;Carl Murray!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Leyla&#39;s smile stayed, frozen in place-until the meaning sank in. Carl Murray? Her stomach dropped. No, that couldn&#39;t be right. It couldn&#39;t be. There had to be a mistake. According to their agreement,Carl should&#39;ve pulled out of the competition long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Hector frowned. &#34;Leyla, why isn&#39;t the champion-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t finish. Leyla was already moving, her heels striking the floor in sharp, deliberate beats as she closed the distance to Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl was still speaking with Eliana when movement caught his eye. He stopped mid-sentence, his gaze shifting to Leyla as she strode toward them, her expression stormy. &#34;Is there something you need?&#34; he asked evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something I need?&#34; Leyla&#39;s laugh was bitter, almost mocking. &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb with me. You know exactly why I&#39;m here. You promised me! How could you go back on your word?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana blinked, glancing between them. &#34;Carl... what did you promise her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl gave a light shrug. &#34;Leyla, I did promise you. But l&#39;also promised Lia I&#39;d win a championship for her. And she asked first-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lied to me!&#34; Leyla&#39;s voice cracked with fury as she lifted her hand to slap him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her palm could connect, Eliana&#39;s fingers closed around her wrist like a vice. &#34;Everyone has a limit,&#34; Eliana said coldly. &#34;How dare you try to hit my brother in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitch!&#34; Leyla spat. &#34;I should hit you too! This is all your fault-everything!&#34; She tried to wrench her wrist free, but Eliana&#39;s grip didn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s other hand shot up,but Eliana was quicker. She shoved Leyla back hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unprepared,Leyla staggered backward.Hector appeared just in time to catch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hector...&#34; Her voice trembled, tears welling up and spilling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s jaw tightened. Nearly two years together, and seeing her so &#34;wronged&#34; pricked something in him.He steadied her, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to glare at Eliana. He said sharply, &#34;Everyone deserves respect, no matter their position.How can you bully Leyla like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d only seen Eliana shove Leyla and missed her attempts to strike first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana snorted, her tone laced with contempt.&#34;|diiot. Protecting an ungrateful traitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s face darkened.&#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Davin&#39;s voice boomed through the speakers. &#34;In addition to announcing the final champion, we have another matter to address. Effective immediately-Leyla Murray is permanently disqualified from The Infinite and banned from all official oil painting competitions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the crowd. Leyla froze, her blood draining from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Hector was the first to speak, his voice ringing with outrage. &#34;What could she possibly have done to deserve that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s hand clung desperately to his sleeve. &#34;Hector... just let it go...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go? No. You might stay silent, but I won&#39;t stand by while you&#39;re bullied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hector, please...&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Davin&#39;s voice cut through again, colder this time. &#34;Since you insist on knowing, I&#39;ll tell you. The painting Leyla submitted in this competition has been proven to be a direct copy of Carl Murray&#39;s work. And not only this time-her winning piece in the last competition was alsoplagiarized from Carl. If you doubt me, look at the screen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The big screen lit up, showing Carl&#39;s originals alongside Leyla&#39;s submissions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance was undeniable-identical in composition and detail, the only difference being Carl&#39;s superior technique and more natural brushwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector stared at the screen, shock flashing in his eyes. Then he turned sharply to Leyla.&#34;Your paintings...you copied them from your brother?&#34;</p>
