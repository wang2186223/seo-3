                <p>Carl&#39;s gaze softened as he leaned toward Eliana. &#34;Lia, you can tell me anything. I promise I won&#39;t get upset,&#34;he said, his voice steady with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than anything, he wanted to shower Eliana with every ounce of care he had to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated only a moment before stating, &#34;I think Leyla&#39;s sudden trip back to our he for her clothes was just an excuse. From the hallway camera, I saw her slip upstairs and go into your room. I&#39;m worried she was there to copy your paintings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Carl&#39;s face, his composure snapping despite his vow. &#34;I&#39;ll question her right now,&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, if Leyla had tried to mimic his work, he would have brushed it off-art had never been something he guarded jealously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, everything had changed. When their family collapsed, Leyla&#39;s first instinct had been to cut all ties with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still, she had gone so far as to sell their home without a second thought, even if it left them wandering without a home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Carl, that kind of cold-blooded betrayal meant she didn&#39;t deserve to benefit from him in the slightest.He would rather burn every canvas he owned than allow Leyla to copy a single brushstroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to storm off to confront her, but Eliana stepped quickly into his path.&#34;Carl, where are you heading?&#34; she asked, her hand lightly catching his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re suspicious of her, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m going to get the truth from her right now!&#34; Carl said, his voice edged with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana found herself momentarily speechless, realizing that being too blunt and straightforward wasn&#39;t always the smartest path. With a weary sigh, she murmured, &#34;Carl, don&#39;t be impulsive. If you rush to confront her now, she&#39;ll just deny everything. It&#39;s better to wait until her painting is actually on display. Once you&#39;re certain she copied yours,then you can expose her in front of everyone. If I&#39;m wrong, though, it&#39;ll only give her the chance to turn things around and put the blame on us instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Carl felt almost sure Leyla had slipped into his room under the guise of collecting her belongings, when in reality, she wanted another look at his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she had plagiarized him before-her last victory at a competition had been with a painting that was nothing more than a stolen version of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Carl couldn&#39;t stand Leyla, he swallowed his anger for the sake of the Murray family&#39;s dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Eliana had urged him not to act recklessly, he forced himself to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always listened to her, trusting she would never steer him wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s thought, he gave a reluctant nod. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll let it go for now. Once the competition results are announced,every painting will be on display.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile. &#34;Exactly. We need to stay composed when it matters most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll listen to you.&#34; He dipped his head once more, this time with quiet resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana reminded with calm insistence, &#34;But don&#39;t reveal that I&#39;m Riley just yet-especially not to Mom.Her health is still fragile, and the last thing she needs is any emotional shock. What matters most is keeping her steady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Stella&#39;s well-being was at stake, Carl gave in at once. He lifted a hand as if taking an oath. &#34;Relax, Lia.I might enjoy swapping stories now and then, but I&#39;m not careless. I know when to keep my mouth shut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders eased a little, and she gave a small nod. &#34;Alright, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the two of them spoke quietly, every contestant had already set down their brushes, and the judges moved on to deliberation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the results would light up the massive screen in the main exhibition hall, drawing the crowd out of the lounge and back into the center of the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, as the organizer, stayed out of sight, overseeing the process with the judges instead of appearing among the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the lounge, Jeffry and Hector emerged together, with Leyla slipping silently in their wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strange silencing effect still clung to her like a shadow, leaving her unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector noticed nothing unusual, assuming her wordless tension was just nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile meant to reassure her, he murmured, &#34;Don&#39;t let it get to you. I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed together as she nodded, emotions twisting in her chest. Almost unconsciously,her gaze swept over the crowd in search of Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted her almost at once-Eliana&#39;s presence was impossible to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then her eyes shifted, and she froze when she saw Carl standing firmly at Eliana&#39;s side. Her eyes flew wide,leaving her mind briefly blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t anticipated running into him here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic prickled at the edges of her thoughts. If Carl recognized her painting as a stolen imitation of his,everything she&#39;d worked for would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers twisted the fabric of her skirt in a tight grip as her thoughts raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t allow Carl to remain here-not if she wanted her secret to stay hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped out her phone and hurriedly typed a message to Carl &#34;I need to speak with you alone. It&#39;s about something important concerning your family. Could you step out for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, the screen flashed a notification-her message hadn&#39;t gone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth sank in-Carl had already shut her out by blocking her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flared in her chest. Her fingers curled into tight fists as she brushed past Hector without sparing him a glance, striding straight toward Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that exact moment, the constricting silence lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat loosened, and when she tentatively tested her voice, words came freely. Relief flickered across her face.Luck was finally on her side again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up her pace, she quickly closed the distance between them until she was standing right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl..&#34; she purred, her tone smooth and syrupy, as though nothing had ever gone wrong between her and the Murray family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown tugged at Carl&#39;s face on instinct.&#34;If you&#39;ve got something to say, then spit it out. Don&#39;t talk to me in that disgusting voice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow swept across Leyla&#39;s expression without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she noticed the mocking smirks flickering among the onlookers, her cheeks burned darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe Carl would humiliate her so openly, especially when they had once been family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting back her temper, she steadied herself, cleared her throat, and forced her voice back into its natural tone. &#34;Carl, there&#39;s something urgent I need to discuss with you. Could we step outside for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s scowl grew heavier, cutting deep lines across his face. &#34;I don&#39;t have a single word to waste on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla had anticipated Carl&#39;s resistance, so she had already armed herself with bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper. &#34;It&#39;s about Rowell. Don&#39;t you want to hear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s features tightened, a flicker of hesitation breaking his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Leyla pressed on. &#34;Aren&#39;t you curious why Rowell&#39;s career has stalled all these years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His acting is sharp, his résumé solid-yet success never comes his way.&#34; Her words hooked him instantly. Carl faltered, about to let her lead him outside when Eliana suddenly stepped in. &#34;Carl, where are you going?&#34; she asked, catching his movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted uneasily, guilt flashing across his face. &#34;I... I just have something to handle. I&#39;ll be back soon,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze lingered on Leyla, quietly certain the outburst had been stirred up by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm smile, she leaned toward him and said softly, &#34;No matter how urgent it feels, wait until the competition is finished first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl shifted uncertainly, caught between the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him hesitate, Leyla quickly pressed in, her tone urgent. &#34;You need to think clearly. Don&#39;t let someone who doesn&#39;t understand delay you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark snapped Carl back into place. His jaw tightened, and he shot her a sharp look. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare talk about Lia that way. She&#39;s right-whatever it is,it can wait until the competition&#39;s over. A few minutes won&#39;t change anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Leyla choked on her words, unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carl refused to budge, her eyes burned with fury as she shot Eliana a venomous glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did that fucking bitch always manage to wreck her plans? Resentment twisted hot in her chest until it nearly consumed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet for all her hatred, there was nothing she could do against Eliana, and the helplessness gnawed at her until she felt as though her skin might crawl apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a voice boomed from the main exhibition hall&#39;s speakers. &#34;The results of the annual oil painting competition are now officially announced. Please turn your attention to the big screen!&#34;</p>
