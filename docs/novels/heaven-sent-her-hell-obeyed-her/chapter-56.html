                <p>Leyla let out a faint, pitiful sob, dabbing at eyes that were perfectly dry before continuing,&#34;When I learned they were hosting a welcome-home banquet for Eliana, I went out of my way to warn them. With their situation right now, I said no one would bother showing up. But they ignored me completely and still threw an extravagant event just for her. Now, I&#39;m sure everyone is laughing behind their backs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped, as though weighed down by worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed dragged on far too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally glanced up, both women across the table were staring at her with parted lips, their expressions caught somewhere between shock and hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease twisted in her chest until Leyla finally asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them let out a half-smile. &#34;If that&#39;s what&#39;s bothering you, Leyla, you can stop worrying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop worrying? What are you talking about?&#34; Her brows knit in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another friend of Leyla jumped in, her tone almost amused. &#34;Because two nights ago, that banquet was nothing like you described. It wasn&#39;t empty-not even close. The place was overflowing. Anyone who showed up late had to stand because every seat was taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes went wide, the disbelief sharp in her voice. &#34;That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching herself, she quickly softened her tone, smoothing her expression. &#34;If you&#39;re only saying that to make me feel better, there&#39;s no need. Everyone knows the Murray family&#39;s fall from grace is the talk of the city...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the truth,&#34; the first girl said firmly. &#34;I&#39;m not trying to soothe your ego. It realy is true. Practically every prominent family in Qidence showed up to their banquet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Leyla&#39;s face. It was unthinkable-the Murray family hadn&#39;t become a public embarrassment at all.Which meant the only person who looked like a fool now.., was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other girl leaned in and said, &#34;I was dragged there too, thanks to my family insisting I meet i is an. Bur Eliana? That bitch wouldn&#39;t even bother to introduce us, let alone share what he likes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried a sharp edge, thick with contempt for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their eyes, a woman like Eliana was beneath them. She was expected to lower her head, speak plainly, and never dare to compete with them for Tristan&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words jolted Leyla, stirring the memory that both the Clarke family and Tristan had visited the Murray estate that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit her hard. Once those two names were on the guest list, what wealthy family would dare stay away? Even if it was nothing more than a performance, they would still have to show their faces for the sake of prestige.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly became clear why no one had dared to sneer at the Murray family&#39;s banquet these past two days.Damn it! How did she not foresee this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line, a flicker of cold calculation flashing in her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the two girls kept badmouthing Eliana, completely missing the change in Leyla&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the focus of the conversation turned back to Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spark came when one of them mentioned the upcoming charity exhibition hosted by the Pearson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leyla, you&#39;re incredible with oil paints. Didn&#39;t Davin Gordon himself praise your work? Word is he&#39;s going to be there. Since you&#39;re acquainted with him, could you hook us up with invitations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another girl jumped at the chance, saying,&#34;|fyou manage to get one, grab another for me,&#39;alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. I&#39;d love to go, but my family didn&#39;t get an invite,&#34; the first girl added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The immediate urge to decline rose inside her. Truthfully, she had only met Davin once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her win in that oil painting competition had given her the chance to speak with him, but the paio she&#39;r been praised for wasn&#39;t even hers-it was a perfect copy of Carl&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her talent lay in copying, not in creating something from her own mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever an oil painting competition came around, she would slip into Carl&#39;s room in search of &#34;inspiration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl might have lacked brilliance in most areas, but his talent for oilpainting was undeniable, though it remained a secret to almost everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I&#39;ve been swamped lately, so I won&#39;t be able to makeit,&#34; she said, offering a flimsy excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she knew Davin would never hand her an invitation, much less several for her friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the girls urged, &#34;Busy or not, you have to be there. There&#39;s going to be an oil painting contest at the exhibition. Leyla, if you enter, you could take the championship. They say the prize is huge. You really can&#39;t miss it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since cutting ties with the Murray family, she no longer had the chance to slip into Carl&#39;s studio for &#34;inspiration&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without those borrowed ideas, stepping into that competition would leave her floundering with nothing to present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment that happened, every whisper about Leyla&#39;s so-called talent would turn into a confirmed truth -she was a fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolving to avoid the risk, she shook her head and said, &#34;I&#39;m swamped right now. Otherwise, I&#39;d be there without a doubt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two girls looked disappointed.&#34;What a shame,&#34; said one girl, clearly disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to back down, the other spoke again. &#34;If you won&#39;t compete, at least try to get us invitations You&#39;ve been kind enough to forgive the Murray family, so doing us this little favor should be nothing for you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see if I can,&#34; said Leyla, keeping her tone vague. &#34;But whether you get them or not depends on whether Mr.Gordon has extras.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine. As long as you try, we won&#39;t hold it against you if it doesn&#39;t work out.&#34; Both girls nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their words, Leyla could already sense the distance they would put between themselves and her if she failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the Murray name behind her, she knew she would be treated like no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile tightened further, feeling heavier than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing her meal in haste, she grabbed her keys and headed straight for Hector&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the place felt hollow,the only sound coming from a maid methodically tidying the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Hector been here today?&#34; she asked, a trace of hope in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid paused briefly before answering, &#34;No. No one&#39;s been by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment flickered in Leyla&#39;s eyes, dulling their brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since they parted ways at the Murray estate, Hector had neither visited nor returned her calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling thought gnawed at her-was he planning to cut her off completely? She found herself pacing in front of the tall window, her steps quickand restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her ties to the Murray family severed, the safety net she once had was gone. If Hector turned away from her now, she would be left with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through another anxious turn,Leyla froze. Doing nothing would only let the distance grow. Hector&#39;s feelings for her might still exist, but without contact,they could fade like smoke. She needed to close that gap before it vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching her phone from the table, Leyla dialed a number she knew belonged to one of Hector&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was answered almost instantly. &#34;Hello, Ms. Murray?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Hector right now?&#34; Leyla asked without preamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t give you that information,&#34; the subordinate replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then don&#39;t,&#34; Leyla said coolly. &#34;But when Hector and I mnake up, the first thing I&#39;ll do is tell him to replace you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blatant threat made the subordinate relent. &#34;He is at the Clarke estate, though he&#39;ll be leaving soon. If you plan to see him, you might want to wait until he&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s he headed?&#34; Leyla asked curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the Pearson Group&#39;s charity exhibition,&#34; the subordinate answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; Leyla murmured before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one conclusion left-she would have to be at that exhibition.</p>
