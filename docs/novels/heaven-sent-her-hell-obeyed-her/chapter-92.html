                <p>&#34;Ms. Murray, is everything alright?&#34; Jonny noticed Leyla standing off to the side, unusually quiet, and approached herin a few quick steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling herself against Tristan&#39;s cold stare, Leyla forced a thin, polite smile. &#34;Sorry, something just came up at home.I really need to head out right now. Please let me know if you hear anything about Mr. Gordon, and I&#39;ll come straight back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Jonny, eager to keep in touch, took out his phone and exchanged numbers with her before she could disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll get going then,&#34; Leyla said, ready to make her escape now that their connection was secured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, just as Jonny started to step aside, Rocco and Doran moved in and blocked the doorway,standing shoulder to shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyebrows drawn together, Leyla eyed them warily. &#34;What&#39;s this about? Why are you blocking my way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Doran gave a blunt answer.&#34;Leaving isn&#39;t an option right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s patience wore thin. &#34;You can&#39;t just keep me here! That&#39;s not how this works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could raise her voice, Rocco softened the tension with a gentle tone.&#34;You&#39;ve got it all wrong. We just need to clear up a few things-once that&#39;s done, you&#39;re free to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Doran playing the heavy and Rocco talking circles, Leyla found it impossible to let her irritation show.&#34;Whatever this is, can it wait? I have somewhere I absolutely need to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of mischief played across Rocco&#39;s face. &#34;So, what&#39;s so pressing? Maybe I can lend a hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla kept her tone cool. &#34;It&#39;s personal, really. Nothing I can&#39;t handle on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved,Rocco continued, &#34;Even so, I&#39;ll have to ask you to wait just a little longer. Whatever it is, it can&#39;t take priority over Mr. Gordon&#39;s condition. As his student, you have a responsibility to stay, don&#39;t you agree?&#34; Words tangled on Leyla&#39;s tongue. &#34;I mean, I...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Tristan&#39;s authority cut throughthe tension. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Rocco, you&#39;ll escort her. Make sure her urgent business is taken care of, then bring her right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood!&#34; Rocco replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course,Leyla had no real emergency-she&#39;d only been looking for a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerves ghawed at her as she weighed her options. Bolting now would only raise more red flags. Choosing to play along, she sighed and gave in. &#34;Alright, you win. Nothing is more important than Davin right now. My own stuff can wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping back from the exit, she made it clear she wasn&#39;t going to argue anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doran finally let his arm drop, but his gaze never wavered, keeping a silent watch to make sure Leyla didn&#39;t try to bolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco led Leyla aside, voice gentle yet probing. &#34;Ms. Murray, we just want to get a clear picture. Can you walk us through exactly what led to Mr. Gordon&#39;s sudden collapse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla had already explained the details to Davin&#39;s family, but she gathered herself and recounted everything once more. &#34;I was standing near the entrance of the exhibition hall when Mr. Gordon spotted me and asked for a quick word. We went to a cafe close by and took a seat together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco asked, &#34;What happened after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;We hadn&#39;t talked for long before he started to complain about some pain in his chest.I immediately wanted him to see a doctor, but he just brushed it off and insisted it was nothing serious.Within a few minutes, his face lost all color, and he started breathing fast. By the time I tried to react, he had already collapsed. I ran out for help right away, and from there, he was rushed here. That&#39;s everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny,standing nearby, joined in with a nod. &#34;I&#39;ve been living with him for years. He&#39;s mentioned chest pain recently, but he&#39;s too stubborn to let anyone take him to the hospital. He just chalks it up to old age. I actually made plans to take him for a check-up after the event today, but I never imagined things would turn out like this.&#34; Emotion tangled Jonny&#39;s words as he tried to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his family, he liked Davin the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout his childhood, Jonny had spent nearly every day learning to paint and sharing a home with Davin, while his own parents were always somewhere far away, chasing careers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful glance passed between Rocco and Tristan. Tristan took a moment, then cut to the heart of things. &#34;What about the bodyguards who were with your grandpa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They went down to the main desk to handle the hospital paperwork,&#34; Jonny explained quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Tristan nodded at Rocco, who took the cue and slipped out to track down the missing bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Leyla&#39;s nerves prickled, but she forced herself to appear calm. Only she and Davin knew the real story of what happened in that private room. If Davin didn&#39;t survive, she&#39;d stay out of trouble. Without evidence,no accusation would stick. Innocent until proven guilty wasn&#39;t just a phrase; it was the rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the operating theater, Eliana had stepped up, taking command as the lead surgeon, all eyes in the room turning to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze in the operating room gravitated toward her, watching her take charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright lights glared overhead, filling the room with heat, and soon sweat gathered along Eliana&#39;s brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse wasted no time, stepping in tó dab the moisture away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, skepticism hung in the air. None of the surgical team were pleased with Eliana&#39;s sudden promotion,least of all the former lead surgeon, who now found himself assisting a much younger doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally,someone of Eliana&#39;s age would still be observing procedures or helping out on the sidelines.Instead, she now led the operation-backed by a direct order from the hospital&#39;s director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That demotion stung, and the original lead surgeon could hardly believe the hospital would risk a patient&#39;s life for politics-at least, not until Eliana began to work.Precision guided every incision she made, each movement efficient and clean, leaving even the harshest critic without a single word to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of experience in cardiac surgery gave the former lead an eye for skill. Within minutes, he realized Eliana was operating at a level well beyond his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation shifted his perspective entirely, and rather than resist, he welcomed the chance to stay by her side. For him, it became a rare opportunity to learn from someone truly exceptional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In medicine, true professionals understood that real talent deserved respect. Genuine skill always won out,and losing a title to someone more gifted was no shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, any doubts about Eliana&#39;s ability had vanished from the former lead surgeon&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes dragged on, tension building with each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in the operating room allowed their focus to waver for even a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly two and a half hours slipped by, the clock&#39;s slow hands tracking every nerve-wracking minute-until suddenly,alarms shattered the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed through the team. &#34;This isn&#39;t good. He&#39;s still bleeding out, and his blood pressure just tanked...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp concentration replaced every trace of doubt on Eliana&#39;s face, but her fingers never trembled.&#34;Dowe have ECMO here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The former head surgeon quickly replied, &#34;We do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get VA-ECMO set up. Now,&#34; Eliana instructed without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One nurse hesitated, concern flickering in her voice. &#34;We&#39;llneed a green light from his family to proceed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clear,urgent voice cut through the hesitation. &#34;Skip the paperwork. I&#39;ll take responsibility and sign whatever&#39;s needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over the nurse. &#34;Understood.&#34; Wasting no time, Eliana scrawled her signature and turned to initiate ECMO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just any intervention-ECMO was top-tier technology for cases of critical heart or lung failure,exactly what Davin was facing now. However, the machine could drain a fortune in just hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Eliana nor the Gordon family flinched at the expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, nothing mattered more than saving Davin&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, every expert in the room understood the risks. ECMO wasn&#39;t just costly; it was a high-stakes procedure. One wrong move, and things could spiral even faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blocking out every distraction, Elfana gave Davin her full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, a silent plea circled in her mind-she was willing to do anything for him to survive this ordeal.</p>
