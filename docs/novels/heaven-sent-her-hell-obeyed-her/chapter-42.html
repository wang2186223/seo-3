                <p>Anaya understood her talents had limits, yet she relied on her own repertoire-especially the kind that worked behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attempt at the Moonlight Club had fallen flat the other night, but the situation had been far from ideal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Tristan&#39;s men crowding the room, she hadn&#39;t found a single opening to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she was certain that the moment she caught him alone, her chance would arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana walked on for a long stretch before sensing the woman&#39;s eyes finally drift away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a sharp instinct for reading people&#39;s real character, and this one radiated the air of someone well-versed in handling men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It startled her that Tristan would bother with a woman like that. Unexpected as it was, it somehow fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no chance her engagement to Tristan would moveforward now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana returned to the villa, Doran was already hurryingtoward her, a trace of concern in his eyes.&#34;You&#39;re back so soon? Did you finish your walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; Eliana replied, her tone giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like some coffee? We just got a fresh batch of beans-supposed to be top quality,&#34; Doran offered eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s kind of you, but don&#39;t trouble yourself. I&#39;ll&#39;go check on Sean Murray,&#34; she said, giving a small shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she made her way upstairs, her steps calm but deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scratching at his hair, Doran leaned toward his subordinate and murmured, &#34;Did I mess up somehow? She looked like she took that the wrong way.&#34; His subordinate blinked in confusion. &#34;Doesn&#39;t seem like you said anything bad. But women... they&#39;re a mystery. Guys like us, still single, don&#39;t stand a chance at figuring them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess you&#39;ve got a point.&#34; With that, Doran let the thought drift away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Sean had already woken from his nap and was testing whether he could ease himself out of bed when Eliana stepped through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s voice stayed even as she asked, &#34;How&#39;s your body holding up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean straightened slowly, testing his balance. &#34;Much better. I think I can walk on my own now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his scrapes were nothing serious, every breath sent a sharp stab through his ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stepped closer, her fingers deft and sure as she slid a few silver needles into precise acupuncture points. The pain in his chest eased almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that&#39;s incredible,&#34; Sean murmured, wide-eyed with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t acknowledge the compliment, only remarking, &#34;If you walk through the door like this, Mom will worry herself sick. I&#39;d rather you stay at a hospital for a few days to recover. Does that sound reasonable to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure... if it keeps her from worrying, I&#39;ll go along with it,&#34; Sean said with an easy shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s decided. I&#39;ve numbed the pain for now, so let&#39;s head out while we can,&#34; Eliana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Sean dipped his head in agreement and followed her from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Doran stepped forward in a rush. &#34;Already on your way?&#34; he asked,eyebrows lifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Eliana&#39;s eyes drifted toward the snug two-story cottage. &#34;We&#39;ve troubled you guys here long enough-it&#39;s time to clear out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that! Since you&#39;ll be looking after Mr. Elbert Pearson from now on, the doors here are always open to you,&#34; Doran said quickly, his tone full of welcome. Eliana&#39;s lips curved in a faint, private sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might be fine with it,but she was certain the woman she&#39;d encountered earlier wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she&#39;d never been one to impose on others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone left no room for argument. &#34;Thank you for the kindness, but there&#39;s no need. When Mr. Pearson returns, please let him know l&#39;Il visit his father when I have the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doran&#39;s anxiety mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Tristan still absent and Eliana preparing to leave, he had no idea how he&#39;d explain this later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He racked his brain, even weighing whether to stop Eliana and Sean by force, when footsteps echoed from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward the sound, he caught sight of Tristan striding back. Since this place was near the police station, Tristan hadn&#39;t been gone long before returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leaving already?&#34; Tristan asked, stepping into the room with sunlight spilling across his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tall frame closed the distance between them in a few long strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s fine now, so we won&#39;t impose any longer,&#34; Eliana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she asked, &#34;So, how did things turn out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of them have been detained and will face trial soon. The Fist Guild is finished,&#34; Tristan repled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His speed in resolving the matter was nothing short of remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana dipped her head slightly. &#34;That&#39;s probably for the best. They won&#39;t be coming after you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan inclined his head in agreement before adding, &#34;Still, a few from the Fist Guild are unaccounted for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d better keep your guard up for now and avoid unnecessary trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the warning. We&#39;ll make sure to stay cautious,&#34; she assured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not easy to catch a taxi out here. If you&#39;re okay with it, I can give you a ride,&#34; Tristan offered. She almost turned him down, but one glance at Sean&#39;s pale complexion-and the thought of nis pain returning-made refusal impossible. &#34;In that case, we&#39;ll trouble you one last time,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No trouble at all. I&#39;m heading back to the office anyway.&#34; His easy smile accompanied a casual gesture for them to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together toward the car, Tristan sliding into the front passenger seat while Eliana and Sean settled into the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car eased out of Maples Villa, its tires whispering against the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana lingered in silence before her curiosity slipped out. &#34;Mr. Pearson, is it true you&#39;re about to get engaged?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the rearview mirror, Tristan&#39;s gaze met hers, his eyes cool yet edged with a hint of amusement.&#34;Seems you&#39;re not just a renowned doctor-you read minds too. It&#39;s true-my family arranged a marriage for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family? So it wasn&#39;t by choice. That suited Eliana just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose her words with care, her tone steady. &#34;If there&#39;s already someone you care for, you shouldn&#39;t wait too long. A loveless marriage will only make both of you miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s shoulders went rigid. How could she possibly know there was someone else in his heart? His gaze flicked toward Doran, who instantly shook his head in silent denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to the rearview mirror, Tristan&#39;s voice was even. &#34;Do you want me to end the engagement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, absolutely,&#34; Eliana answered without hesitation-then caught herself. A faint, apologetic smile softened her tone. &#34;I only mean that mutual affection should be the foundation of marriage. Without it,you&#39;re both just wasting precious years. Don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s mouth curved in faint agreement. &#34;As it happens, I feel the same. I&#39;d intended to end the engagement today, but the Fist Guild mess got in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of satisfaction lit in Eliana&#39;s chest. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, there&#39;s no reason to waste another minute.I can deliver the news on your behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched a brow, turning his head to study her. His gaze, dark and incisive, seemed to strip away every layer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana briefly questioned whether he knew she was Louis and Stella&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, his voice came low and deliberate. &#34;Do you have close ties with the Murray family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked toward Sean. &#34;If I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have saved him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;What exactly is your connection to the Murray family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved faintly. &#34;Are you trying to dig into my background?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all-just curious,&#34; he replied with a small shake of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for curiosity,&#34; she said evenly. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of calling off the engagement. You get what you want without wasting time. Isn&#39;t that simpler?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of visiting the Murray family had never appealed to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saving Sean today, he figured the Murray family owed him a favor and wouldn&#39;t take offense at breaking the engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, I&#39;ll leave it in your hands: My thanks,&#34; he said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy to oblige,&#34; Eliana answered without hesitation, genuinely eager to see it done.</p>
