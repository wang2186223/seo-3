                <p>A faint aroma drifted through the air from the candle Eliana had set alight. Its effect was gentle yet insidious,coaxing those already asleep into an even deeper rest that clung to them like heavy fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone still awake, however, would feel nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had given the candle a moment to work, Eliana flicked on the room&#39;s lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon?&#34; Her voice held a careful edge, yet the figure on the bed remained motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loose silk pajama pants clung softly to Damon&#39;s legs. Kneeling beside him, Eliana pushed the fabric upward and began her examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His muscles had already started to lose their tone from long disuse, the beginnings of atrophy showing in the softened contours of his calves. Without timely treatment, he could never walk on his own again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, she didn&#39;t come into his life too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her medical kit, drawing out her acupuncture tools before beginning the delicate work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour slipped by before she packed her instruments away, turned off the lights, and slipped quietly out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came in what felt like the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her welcome-home banquet scheduled for the next day, all of Eliana&#39;s brothers except Damon were caught up in preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella, on the other hand, took her to a beauty salon for some pampering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s skin was naturally soft, but the facial left it even smoother, supple and radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Murray, your complexion is flawless, and you&#39;re breathtaking! If you joined the entertainment industry,you&#39;d be a star in no time,&#34; a beautician said, her eyes shining with admiration. The praise lit up Stella&#39;s face with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her a membership card. I&#39;ll bring her in for a facial every week,&#34; Stella instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana quickly stepped in. &#34;Mom, you don&#39;t have to spend on this for mne. I&#39;m not interested in such things.You should keep your money for what really matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella waved off her concern with a smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lia. I can afford it.&#34; She gave the beautician a nod to go ahead with the registration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another staff member approached. &#34;Mrs. Murray, your spa room is ready. Would you like to head in now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Eliana, Stella asked, &#34;Why don&#39;t you join me for a treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s answer was immediate. She had never liked strangers touching her, and her head shook firmly. &#34;I&#39;ll pass. You go enjoy it-it&#39;s good for your health. I&#39;ll wait outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her refusa left no room for persuasion, and Stella relented. &#34;Alright. Grab some coffee and relax while I&#39;m inside. I won&#39;t be long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Eliana responded with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Stella disappeared into the spa room, Eliana, with nothing else to occupy her, began to wander through the salon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beauty salon occupied an expansive three-story building, all polished glass and soft lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing one of the treatment rooms, Eliana caught the sound of a voice she knew all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Neal&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps froze, and she tilted her head toward the open gap in the doorway. &#34;What do you mean there&#39;s no fix?&#34; Neal&#39;s tone was sharp enough to cut glass. &#34;My face was perfectly fine a few days ago! Now it looks like this-don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s not because of your products. How am I supposed to go out in public like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana eased the door open just enough to peek inside. Neal&#39;s once-smooth face was now a horror of swollen pustules, the skin inflamed and glistening with pus-like the mottled hide of a sick toad. One of the staff spoke in a measured, soothing tone. &#34;Sir, please try to relax. We&#39;ll start with a tnorough rinse to clear the pus, then apply our ointment. You should see improvement quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal let out a sharp breath but eventually leaned back into the chair, irritation still etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been his looks that first caught Khloe&#39;s attention. If those looks were destroyed, there was no way he could hope to marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made his voice snap again. &#34;Stop wasting time-fix it now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside the door, Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a faint, knowing smile at the sound of his overbearing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal&#39;s face hadn&#39;t been ruined by the salon&#39;s products at all-it was the work of the silver needle Eliana had flicked into him without notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The needle&#39;s tip carried a specially prepared toxin, one that would ensure his features never returned to their former glory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his charm and livelihood had always hinged on his appearance, Eliana couldn&#39;t help but wonder what he&#39;d become once that advantage was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Neal and Janessa, the Clarke family had been their shortcut to instant success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To lose that dream right as it was within reach would cut deeper than death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet,Eliana knew this was only the first act-she intended for them to endure much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the door closed behind her, Eliana made her way back to the lounge to wait for Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Day by day, Stella&#39;s health had improved. When she stepped out from her spa session, her cheeks were warm with color, and she looked almost indistinguishable from someone in perfect health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were just about to leave when an all-too-familiar figure crossed their path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slightly plump middle-aged woman, dripping in expensive fabrics and wearing her arrogance like perfume,sauntered over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes as she addressed Stella, saying, &#34;Mrs. Murray, I hear your husband still hasn&#39;t been released. And here you are, finding the time for a facial instead of trying to get him out.Your composure is truly remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words carried the tone of a compliment, but the sting beneath them accused Stella of pampering herself while neglecting Louis&#39;s plight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s face cooled instantly, her expression hardening to stone. She had her reasons for not stepping in to rescue Louis, and none of them were anyone else&#39;s concern-least of all the woman standing before her,Addie White, Brenda&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, their families were set to become in-laws. But after Damon&#39;s legs were crippled, the White family had begun to quietly distance themselves, offering subtle snubs while pretending nothing had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, they&#39;d been careful, keeping their disdain behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the Murray family had fallen into bankruptcy, Addie didn&#39;t bother to hide her contempt-mockery came easier than sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization sent a tremor through Stella&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana noticed and slipped her hand gently over Stella&#39;s, a quiet anchor that softened her expression just enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her gaze on Addie, Stella&#39;s voice was calm but sharp as glass. &#34;Mrs. White, it&#39;s been some time.trust you&#39;ve been well? And Brenda, too? I do wonder, though... when the night is quiet, does she ever think about the man who lost the use of his legs saving her life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Addie&#39;s face, her eyes skittering away. No rebuttal came. She gave a small cough instead. &#34;We&#39;ll make inquiries about Mr. Murray&#39;s situation. But from here on, I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t bring up the past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her wrist, she signaled to a bodyguard, who immediately stepped forward and offered an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She extended the envelope toward Stella, her tone dripping with polite formality. &#34;Brenda will be getting engaged soon. This is an invitation to the banquet. Mrs. Murray, if you still care about Mr. Murray&#39;s situation and wish for our family&#39;s support, please see that Damon receives this-and encourage him to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that she truly wanted Damon there. But if he failed to show up, tongues would wag about the White family&#39;s ingratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence, however, would paint a very different picture-one of two families who had spoken, reached an understanding, and parted on amicable terms, with Damon personally offering Brenda his blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That, more than anything, would silence the whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if the Murray family themselves showed no resentment, there would be no room left for gossip.</p>
