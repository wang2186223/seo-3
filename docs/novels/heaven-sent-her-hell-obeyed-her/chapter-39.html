                <p>Darkness swallowed Eliana before she could even take in the man&#39;s features, her body giving way as consciousness slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before her head met the floor, a strong hand caught her, steadying her face with surprising care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si!&#34; Rocco burst through the doorway, eyes darting to the figure in Tristan&#39;s arms. Only when he stepped closer did he recognize Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression shifted as realization struck. &#34;She? Then the people fainting outside... all of that was her doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Tristan gave a brief nod, his gaze flicking toward Sean slumped in the chair. &#34;Take him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the Fist Guild members?&#34; Rocco asked, already bracing for the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Simon here. Tell himn he has two paths-face the Fist Guild head-on, or deal with me instead.&#34; Tristan ordered,his voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s expression tightened as he replied, &#34;Got it.&#34; For years, the police had avoided going up against the Fist Guild, knowing just how shrewd and slippery the group could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They operated under the harmless guise of a boxing gym, hiding their backroom dealings behind locked doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tracking their crimes had always been like trying to follow smoke in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still, their members included people with connections high enough to keep them untouchable -men like Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon Quimby, the police chief, was only weeks from retirement and had no appetite for the mess that would follow if he challenged them now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Tristan&#39;s words left no room for escape. This time,Simon would have to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had planned to anchor his influence in Qidence without stirring trouble with either the Fist Guild or the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That intention shattered the moment instinct outweighed restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco remained on-siteto wait for Simon&#39;s men,while Doran took charge of transporting Sean. Inside the car, Doran settled into the driver&#39;s seat and glanced at Tristan, asking, &#34;Where do you want them taken,sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shifted from Eliana, limp in his arms, to Sean,slumped against the passenger seat. &#34;We&#39;re going to my place,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Doran pressed down on the accelerator,and the vehicle sped through the city streets toward their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security gates parted one by one until they reached the lakeside property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Tristan stepped out, still carrying Eliana,his personal doctor was already standing at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A meticulous examination later, the doctor finally spoke. &#34;She&#39;s collapsed from fatigue and has also inhaled a mild toxin. I&#39;ve given her an injection-she&#39;ll come around soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the man?&#34; Tristan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His condition is serious but stable. No danger to his life. I&#39;ll begin treatment immediately,&#34; the doctor answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it,&#34; Tristan said. &#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze lingered on Eliana as she lay on the bed.Her brows drew together in discomfort, and the color had drained from her lips, leaving them ghostly pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned closer, intending to adjust her blanket,when her eyes snapped open. In a flash, a silver needle shot toward his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before it could close the last five centimeters, his hand locked around her wrist. His expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;That&#39;s a curious way to repay the man who just saved your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes adjusted, and the face before her came into focus-it was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The needle in her grip had been pure reflex,her body reacting to the sense of someone closing in. She hadn&#39;t expected him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure driving the needle forward eased,and Tristan let go of her hand without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around, she took in the unfamiliar room,every detail putting her on guard. &#34;Where am I? And how exactly did I end up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fragments of memory returned-she&#39;d been inside the Fist Guild gym. &#34;I was there on my own business,&#34; Tristan replied in an even tone. &#34;Found you passed out. Since I had no idea where you live, I brought you here instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization clicked into place. This had to be the Maples Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if reading her thoughts, Tristan said plainly,&#34;You&#39;re in the Maples Villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another memory slammed into her-the moment she had been seconds away from a deadly fight with Flint,when a sudden strike had sent him sprawling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that was you,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct.&#34; His brow lifted in quiet amusement.&#34;Seems you&#39;re stacking up debts with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held his gaze, silent long enough for the air to feel weighted, before saying,&#34;What do you want me to do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Tristan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This makes the third time you&#39;ve stepped in for me.If you have something you need from me,you can ask now,&#34; Eliana answered with quiet composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trusting that anyone would step in three times without wanting something back felt impossible to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, almost mocking laugh slipped from Tristan.&#34;What? Hard to believe I might actually enjoy lending a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana met his gaze in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he truly were as generous and uncomplicated as he claimed, there was no way he could have risen to control the intricate Pearson family in such a short span.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts settled, and she finally said, &#34;Please spare me the guessing. Just tell me what you want. I&#39;m not the type to keep debts hanging over my head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped Tristan, the kind that hinted at reluctant amusement. She might look agreeable on the surface, but he was learning she was as unyielding as they came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then,&#34; he said at last. &#34;My father&#39;s been unwell recently.I want you to treat him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; Eliana asked, skepticism lining her voice.She had already given that promise before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan replied, &#34;For anything else, give me some time.Nothing else comes to mind just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; She gave a single nod. her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, almost mocking laugh slipped from Tristan.&#34;What? Hard to believe I might actually enjoy lending a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana met his gaze in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he truly were as generous and uncomplicated as he claimed, there was no way he could have risen to control the intricate Pearson family in such a short span.</p>

                <p>Her thoughts settled, and she finally said, &#34;Please spare me the guessing. Just tell me what you want. I&#39;m not the type to keep debts hanging over my head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped Tristan, the kind that hinted at reluctant amusement. She might look agreeable on the surface, but he was learning she was as unyielding as they came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then,&#34; he said at last. &#34;My father&#39;s been unwell recently.I want you to treat him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; Eliana asked, skepticism lining her voice.She had already given that promise before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan replied, &#34;For anything else, give me some time.Nothing else comes to mind just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; She gave a single nod. His lips lifted faintly as he dragged a chair closer and sat beside her. &#34;I&#39;ve helped you three times now. Are you going to tell me your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana,&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana,&#34; Tristan repeated, letting the sound linger.&#34;It suits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a perfunctory smile and asked about Sean,&#34;That man tied to the chair earlier-what happened to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in the room next door. My doctor is with him,&#34;Tristan answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Eliana flung the blanket aside, swinging her legs to get up-only to freeze mid-motion when she realized her clothes were entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes snapped to Tristan, the chill in them sharp enough to cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both hands lifted in a placating gesture, he said,&#34;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I had one of the maids change you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze narrowed, studying his face for the slightest crack in composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a half-shrug and a weary breath, Tristan added,  &#34;Trust me, I wouldn&#39;t sink low enough to take advantage of someone unconscious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in her stare melted away completely at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate it,&#34; she said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got it backwards. I&#39;m the one who should be thanking you.&#34; His mouth curved into a smile as his eyes lingered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed her face.&#34;Thanking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the Pearson Group has just shifted its focus to Qidence, and the Fist Guild has been causing trouble repeatedly. I went there today to deal with them,but thanks to you, that mess got handled a lot faster,&#34;Tristan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it made sense to her why he had turned up at the Fist Guild gym in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the head of the Fist Guild?&#34; Eliana asked,thinking of Flint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably sitting under a bright light at the police station as we speak,&#34; Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a short nod, ready to ask about seeing Sean,when a knock sounded and a man in a white coat rushed in. &#34;Mr. Pearson, the gentleman next door just started vomiting blood, I-&#34; the doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden rush of air cut him off as a shadow darted past. By the time he registered the movement,the bed was empty-Eliana was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another blast of wind followed an instant later. Tristan,too,had vanished from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stared at the doorway in disbelief.</p>
