                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows drew together in suspicion. Rocco was usually composed-unlike Doran, he rarely looked rattled-so this unsettled edge immediately put him on guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Tristan pressed, his voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s gaze flicked toward Eliana, who was already staring at him intently, waiting. &#34;Word just came in-Mr.Davin Gordon suffered a heart attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes flew wide, her body leaning forward as she demanded, &#34;When did it happen? How is he now?Which hospital are they taking him to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only a few minutes ago,&#34; Rocco immediately answered. &#34;He hasn&#39;t even reached the hospital yet. His family&#39;s rushing him to the hospial. If we leave right away, we might catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shifted toward Carl, her words edged with urgency.&#34;Did you drive here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl gave a brisk nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand me the keys,&#34; Eliana insisted firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Oh-sure...&#34; He hadn&#39;t even finished processing her urgency when she snatched the keys straight from his hand and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl blinked at the empty space where she&#39;d been. How could anyone move that fast? He then spun around,only to find Tristan had vanished as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? Did the two of them just slip away like smoke? When Carl shifted his gaze once more, Rocco was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing there, Carl blinked in disbelief. Was he really the only normal person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Jordy appeared just then, striding over with concern etched across his face. &#34;Why are you out here by yourself? Where&#39;s Eliana?&#34; &#34;Jordy, can you give me a ride?&#34; Carl asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Take me straight to the nearest hospital-right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Jordy answered, already moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short while, Carl found himself standing before an electric moped. &#34;This is your means of transportation?&#34; he asked, incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordy rubbed the back of his neck as he defended himself. &#34;It&#39;s the weekend. Traffic&#39;s a nightmare, and I didn&#39;t want to crawl here in a car, so l figured this would be faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never mind. Just hand over the keys!&#34; Carl snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching them from Jordy&#39;s hand, he mounted the moped and shot off without another word, leaving Jordy staring after him in stunned confusion. WVhy the rush?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ago, Eliana slid into Carl&#39;s car, buckling her seatbelt. Before she could even settle in, the passenger door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted together as Tristan dropped himself into the seat beside her, leaning back with easy confidence, making it obvious he intended to tag along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her glare slid toward him, Tristan drawled with a crooked grin,&#34;What? Am I not allowed to hitch a ride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sedan trailed them, Rocco behind the wheel. It was Tristan&#39;s car. Why had Tristan insisted on climbing into her car instead of his own?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kicking him out would cost precious seconds, and time was the one thing she couldn&#39;t afford to waste. With a sharp press of her foot, she gunned the accelerator and shot onto the main road, weaving into traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands gripped the wheel with practiced ease, but the clogged streets quickly swallowed her momentum. A chorus of blaring horns boxed her in. She slammed her palm against her own horn, its shrill blast cutting through the din. But the jam refused to budge. A driver in the next lane rolled down his window, sneering as he lifted a middle finger, mocking her impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; A shadow crossed Eliana&#39;s face, turning her features severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had time not been slipping away, she wouldn&#39;t be blaring the horn in desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Tristan stayed composed, his voice steady as he tried to cut through her panic. &#34;Take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital is one of the best when it comes to cardiology. Davin will be in good hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s fingers tightened around,the steering wheel, knuckles paling as her pulse raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned slightly toward her, his tone firm yet patient. &#34;Driving like this only makes things more dangerous.The faster you push, the messier it gets. You need to keep your head clear. When we get there,they might needyou-and if you burn yourself out on the road, you won&#39;t be able to help him at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the tension in her expression loosened, her rigid shoulders sinking an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s more like it,&#34; Tristan said quietly, a faint nod of approval softening his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana kept her eyes locked on the gridlocked road, her teeth tugging anxiously at her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice came out low, almost as if she were talking to both Tristan and herself. &#34;This happened because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan glanced at her,brow creasing in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a shaky breath, she admitted, &#34;When he walked out earlier, I could tell he wasn&#39;t well. I should&#39;ve gone with him-should&#39;ve pushed him to see a doctor. But I didn&#39;t. I convinced myself he was just tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint scowl pulled at Tristan&#39;s face as he answered, &#34;You&#39;ve already done your part. Nobody can predict everything. If people could see every accident coming, the world would be nothing but panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted as though she wanted to argue, but no words came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his usual mischief, she couldn&#39;t deny that his blunt reassurance had steadied her heart more than</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she expected. Like a steady hand calming the turmoil inside her, the thought cracked her open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first, I never wanted to take him as my apprentice. Taking on an apprentice means a responsibility and would complicate things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like today. If she hadn&#39;t known Davin, if there were no ties between them, she wouldn&#39;t be carrying this weight now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you still accepted him,&#34; Tristan remarked, his gaze fixed steadily on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted briefly, a strained laugh escaping before she went on,&#34;YOUmight think Davin is easygoing, but once he sets his mind on something, there&#39;s no shaking him off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; Tristan asked, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a way of listening that made her feel as if every word mattered. His gaze stayed fixed on her face,calm and attentive, and that quiet respect loosened something in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her eyes away, she added, &#34;The moment I helped him that first time, he started showing up again and again, pestering me toa take him as my apprentice. Back then, he didn&#39;t know I was Riley. Each visit he dragged along gifts, piling them higher and higher. I grew so weary of it that I packed up and moved elsewhere. But months later, when I finally returned to my old place, I discovered he&#39;d been waiting there day after day, never leaving. That winter the snow fell thick and merciless, yet he stood in it as if the cold couldn&#39;t touch him. I began to fear he really might freeze to death. In the end, I had no choice. To keep it from turning into a matter of life and death, I finally took him in as an apprentice. The instant I agreed, he dropped to his knees in the snow and bowed deeply-then collapsed right there in the frost. Tell me,wasn&#39;t that utterly foolish of him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her tone was chastising, her reddened eyes betrayed her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan silently extended a tissue, but Eliana ignored it, stubbornly swallowing her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he pulled the tissue back, a notion flickered across his mind-if she had once taken Davin as an apprentice out of pity, maybe, with persistence, he too might...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the thought could form fully, Eliana&#39;s gloom suddenly lifted. She leaned forward, hastily cranking down the car window. &#34;Carl!&#34; she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan followed her line of sight and spotted Carl zooming past on an electric moped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia? You&#39;re still stuck here?&#34; Carl queried, his voice carrying over the hum of the motor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting breath, Eliana lunged forward and seized the moped&#39;s handlebars. &#34;Get down, Carl! We&#39;re switching!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Oh, alright,&#34; Carl stammered, nodding quickly. He slid off the seat, and Eliana swung herself onto it in one swift motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful. This thing packs more power than it looks,&#34; Carl warned, hovering uneasily beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a curt nod, tossed the car keys into his hand, and prepared to speed away-when the seat behind her sank under sudden weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana darted a glance over her shoulder. Somehow, Tristan had slipped out of the car without her noticing and made himself comfortable on the back.</p>
