                <p>Stan&#39;s voice was ice-cold. &#34;Miss, if you&#39;re here to scam us, take it elsewhere. How can you claim to be my father&#39;s teacher? His teacher is the famous painter Riley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver. &#34;I am Riley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan burst into laughter. &#34;What a joke! If you&#39;re going to lie, at least make it believable. Leave now, or I&#39;ll call the police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call them if you like,&#34; Eliana said flatly. She brushed past them and turned to the doctor. &#34;How is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor hesitated.&#34;He is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, don&#39;t waste your time with her!&#34; Jonny cut him off sharply. He stepped forward, reaching for Eliana&#39;s arm. &#34;She&#39;s an impostor. None of us know her. We&#39;ll have her removed immediately.&#34; Eliana slid aside before he could touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost!&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s face darkened with fury. &#34;You&#39;re looking for trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana met his glare head-on, her tone cool and unyielding. &#34;I&#39;m here to save Davin. As long as he&#39;s still breathing, I might be able to pull him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny sneered, &#34;Save my grandpa? Weren&#39;t you just claiming to be Riley, a great painter? What now? You&#39;ve stopped painting and turned into a doctor? Can&#39;t you come up with a more believable lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s glared at him. &#34;Are you trying to stand in my way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she understood-this man was Davin&#39;s grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he would pose a problem, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to knock him out and go in anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could move, Leyla&#39;s voice rang out. &#34;I know her. She can&#39;t cure anyone. I&#39;ve seen her deceive people before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s disgust deepened instantly. &#34;I knew it! Get out-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan wasn&#39;t having it either. He barked at the doctor, &#34;Call security and throw this liar out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a liar!&#34; Eliana snapped, fixing her gaze on the doctor. &#34;I have a medical license. Let me into the operating room. Every second wasted reduces his chances of survival. If anything goes wrong, I&#39;ll bear the responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; the doctor faltered. His eyes flicked between Eliana and the Gordons. But in the end, he chose to trust the patient&#39;s family. He couldn&#39;t possibly allow a totaI stranger into the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, if you keep interfering, I&#39;ll call security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; Eliana opened her mouth to argue, but heavy footsteps echoed down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar male voice rang out. &#34;Let her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned toward the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw several figures approaching quickly, Tristan at the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present was visibly startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson? Why are you here?&#34; Stan hurried forward in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor followed Stan, glancing at the elderly man walking beside Tristan. &#34;Mr. Hewitt? You&#39;re here as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Moran Hewitt, the director of the hospital himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After arriving at the hospital, Tristan had deliberately split from Eliana to find the director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew hospitals ran under strict rules. No matter how skilled Eliana was, without official approval she would never be allowed into the operating room. That was why Tristan hadn&#39;t walked over with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to save your old man,&#34; Tristan said simply, his face unreadable. His connection with Davin was mostly business. Normally, he wouldn&#39;t interfere this directly. But with Davin&#39;s life hanging by a thread, he had no choice but to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Tristan&#39;s words, Stan&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Pearson. You are so kind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curved in a faint smile. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me. Thank her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his chin toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan followed his gaze, and when his eyes landed on Eliana, his face froze in shock. &#34;She...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the renowned doctor from Eighvale,&#34; Tristan announced calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;What? She is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Tristan cut him off, his tone edged with steel. &#34;So-are you still going to stop her from saving your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan&#39;s fists clenched at his sides. For several tense seconds, he hesitated. Then he drew in a deep breath and nodded. &#34;I tust your judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla paled. She hurried forward to protest, but Tristan&#39;s cold, piercing gaze pinned her in pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad...&#34; Jonny tried again, his voice thick with disapproval. &#34;We don&#39;t even know who this woman really is.How can we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Stan barked, silencing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had vouched for Eliana, leaving Stan no room to argue. Even if she were a complete novice, he had to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything went wrong, Tristan would bear the responsibility. They had nothing to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Stan knew Tristan. He wasn&#39;t the type of man to gamble recklessly. If he vouched for Eliana, then he was certain she could save Davin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you decided?&#34; Tristan asked, his tone edged with impatience. &#34;Yes,&#34; Stan said quickly. &#34;We&#39;ll trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Tristan gave a curt nod, then turned to Moran. &#34;Mr. Hewitt, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moran waved a hand, his tone firm. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, just doing my job. Having such a legendary doctor perform surgery here is an honor for our hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held out an official document, granting Eliana the title of Visiting Specialist at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, she could step into the operating room freely, saving lives whenever she wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Armed with the director&#39;s endorsement letter, the attending doctor no longer dared to stop Eliana.Straightening respectfully, he gestured toward the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lead the way,&#34; Eliana said crisply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before entering, she turned to Tristan and gave him a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile-steady, reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t name, it eased the tension in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a dull thud, the operating room doors swung shut, sealing her from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gordons thanked Tristan over and over before urging him to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted with a quiet grace, lowering himself onto the waiting bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s lips curved faintly. The sight of Eliana disappearing into surgery filled her with twisted relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Eliana couldn&#39;t possibly save Davin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her presence inside would only spell disaster. Davin was as good as dead. The thought settled her nerves.She decided to take her leave then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer she lingered, the more likely Eliana would start questioning her presence. Better to leave before suspicion arose. It was the end for Davin anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla turned to go, moving quietly down the corridor. &#34;Miss Murray, are you leaving?&#34; Jonny&#39;s voice rang out behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body stiffened. Slowly, she turned. Jonny&#39;s curious gaze was on her... but it was Tristan&#39;s icy stare beyond him that sent a chill stabbing straight through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart lurched violently. She internally cursed Jonny for his meddling.</p>
