                <p>&#34;Calling her a busybody is too lenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree! She&#39;s just downright spiteful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The muttering around the room quickly swelled,voices rising with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A good number in the crowd were loyal supporters of Riley, eager for the rare chance to have their work critiqued by her. They&#39;d come with high hopes, only to watch them crumble to dust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disappointment curdled into anger, and the harsh remarks carried easily to Leyla&#39;s ears. Her lips pressed into a thin line. In her mind, those who lacked artistic understanding had no business being here. Their departure should have been a blessing to anyone with real talent. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with petty insults.Were these people completely unhinged?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,she brushed their words aside with cool disdain. In her eyes, the outcome was already decided-victors were the ones who wrote history, and soon enough,she would be the one holding the pen. Settle down, all of you!&#34; Larry&#39;s voice cut through the noise as he rose from his seat. &#34;Check your painting supplies. If you&#39;re missing anything, speak up now. If everything&#39;s in order, we&#39;ll start the competition immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No tools missing over here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set on my side, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Larry gave a short nod. &#34;Alright then, the competition begins now! You&#39;ve got two hours to finish your work.There&#39;s no set theme, but it must be in oil. Let your creativity lead the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words landed, brushes began to move and pencils scratched across canvases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the rules didn&#39;t dictate a subject, most had already envisioned their final piece before the clock even started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla, in particular, skipped any preliminary sketching altogether, diving straight into her painting with swift,assured strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The decisiveness caught Davin&#39;s attention. Though her earlier clash with Riley still left a bitter taste, he couldn&#39;t deny the precision and natural skill in her technique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the farthest corner, Carl was the last to pick up his brush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roped into the contest at the last minute,he had only just learned the details. He spent a good while mapping out his composition before finally applying the first stroke of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the auction had wound down, and those not competing were escorted into a lavish lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, crystal glasses gleamed with fine liquor, and trays of delicate, artful pastries awaited them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector set a plate with a delicate slice of dessert in front of Jeffry. &#34;Dad, you came straight here without dinner. You should eat something to tide you over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For weeks, Jeffry had been distant toward his son.yet tonight he didn&#39;t push the offering away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A father could be disappointed, even angry, but the bond of blood made it hard to close his heart entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, his opinion of Leyla had improved somewhat,and Hector&#39;s small act of goodwill gave him an easy chance to soften his stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered across Hector&#39;s face, though before he could speak further, a murmur rose from the lounge entrance. Both men turned to see the cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stepped inside, her arrival pulling every eye toward her as if she carried her own spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector realized this was the first time he had truly taken in her appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s beauty was undeniable, but Eliana... she possessed a glow that edged beyond it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Leyla&#39;s elegance came wrapped in a luxurious gown, Eliana&#39;s magnetism was sharpened by a chic,perfectly tailored suit that spoke of sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of their first meeting flashed in his mind -her clothes then had been worn and plain, more fitting for a beggar than a guest in high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,dressed in refined attire, she radiated a poised,noble grace that made every other socialite in the room fade into the scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s gaze lingered on Eliana, taking in every detail of her refined poise. Admiration stirred in his eyes,though it was tinged with something almost wistful. &#34;If she hadn&#39;t been separated from the Murrays, maybe the one by your side wouldn&#39;t be Leyla at all, but her.A girl like that would be a credit to you-and to me.And when it comes to health, she&#39;s the sort who could outlast any ailment. After all, she could even heal  even what others can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark made Hector&#39;s brow crease instinctively.&#34;Dad, Leyla is my girlfriend. I truly care for her...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he defended her, the suggestion his father had planted worked its way into his thoughts like a seed taking root, subtle and unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s eyes cut to his son with quiet certainty.&#34;I know you better than you think. This talk of &#39;genuine feelings&#39;-it&#39;s just the thrill of wanting what your mother and I disapprove of. If there were no opposition, and you married Leyla without any hindrance,I doubt it would last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector found himself unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry let out a quiet sigh and gave his head a small shake. &#34;Alright, enough of this topic. If you claim your feelings are real, I&#39;ll take your word for it. Since you&#39;re so determined, I&#39;ll give Leyla a fair shot. But she&#39;ll need to prove herself by winning today&#39;s competition -show me she&#39;s worth something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll win,&#34; Hector answered without hesitation, his tone brimming with certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say more, movement at the doorway drew every eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had arrived. Without hesitation, his steps  carried him straight to Eliana&#39;s side, as though that was where he belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the two together, the Clarke men exchanged a brief, unreadable glance before making their way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry greeted them first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both acknowledged him with slight nods, their cool,self-possessed air almost identical- so much so it set Hector oddly on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling was unfamiliar, and for reasons Hector couldn&#39;t pinpoint, it left him unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry began cautiously. &#34;Dr. Murray, I wanted to ask you a few things concerning my father&#39;s health...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Eliana had already committed to Miguel&#39;s treatment, walking away halfway was never an option in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a simple nod. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Jeffry&#39;s lips parted, but no words followed. Something in his expression suggested hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing it, Tristan interjected smoothly, &#34;I&#39;ve got something personal to handle. You two carry on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that we&#39;re alone, you can speak freely.&#34; Eliana shifted her focus back to Jeffry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Jeffry got to the point. &#34;It&#39;s not actually about my father-it&#39;s about a friend of his. The man&#39;s illness mirrors my father&#39;s, and after hearing of his recovery,he came to me seeking help...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana lifted a hand, cutting him off. &#34;There&#39;s no need to go further. I treated your father because I gave my word. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m obliged to help someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry leaned forward, almost urgent. &#34;If it&#39;s a matter of payment,I can meet whatever price you set.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then have him submit a request through the Onyx Syndicate,&#34; Eliana replied evenly. &#34;But whether I agree will depend entirely on my mood-and on whether l see any reason to deal with him at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even hearing that limited assurance was enough to make Jeffry&#39;s expression warm. &#34;I appreciate it.I&#39;ll pass along what you&#39;ve said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the two spoke, Hector&#39;s gaze never left Eliana.It struck him that this was the first time he&#39;d truly studied her up close. With every passing second, her beauty seemed more striking, almost disarming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla shared a hint of her features, and Leyla&#39;s looks were already celebrated. Yet, side by side in his mind,the difference was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere deep inside, a small, unacknowledged doubt began to take root-and without him realizing,it quietly pushed deeper.</p>
