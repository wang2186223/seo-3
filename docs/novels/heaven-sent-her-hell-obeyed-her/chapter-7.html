                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow knitted ever so slightly as she drew ín a breath to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella cut in before a word could leave her mouth.&#34;Sean! Watch your tone. Don&#39;t forget, Lia is your sister. You played a big part in her disappearance,and now that she&#39;s back, you should be looking out for her, not speaking against her. And remember this -our family started from nothing. Our ancestors worked the fields with their own hands. No matter how high we climb, we must keep our feet on the ground. You should go back to your room, think about what you did, and you&#39;re not stepping outside this house unless I say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outburst caught Eliana off guard, and she stared at Stella in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her astonishment had nothing to do with the defens itself. It was the phrase about staying humble despite success. That was the same thing she often told her own team members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing they shared such similar values sparked a quiet admiration for Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean, on the other hand, shifted uneasily. &#34;Mom, look at what&#39;s happening to us. How can you expect me to just sit here? I need to get to the Fist Guild and see if someone there can help Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not your concern! The Fist Guild only fuels reckless impulses, and you&#39;re done going there,&#34;Stella retorted without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen the change in him over the years. The guild had sharpened him, yes, but into something brash and defiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, she wished she had never allowed him to train there at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom...&#34; Sean&#39;s voice carried a note of protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you stopped listening to me? Are you trying to -&#34; The rest of her words dissolved into a harsh,relentless cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Sean&#39;s resolve crumble. &#34;Please don&#39;t get upset. I&#39;ll head back to my room right now and think things over...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on Eliana for a long moment, the look carrying nothing but irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her return, he had convinced himself that misfortune had followed-the family teetering on bankruptcy, chaos at every turn, and now he was the one being told to reflect on his behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Eliana was nothing more than bad luck walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muttering under his breath, Sean turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl stepped closer, trying to ease the tension. &#34;Lia,don&#39;t take it personally. Sean&#39;s a bit narrow in how he sees things, but he&#39;s not a bad guy. Once he comes around, he&#39;ll treat you better than he treats himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to dwell on it,&#34; said Eliana with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, Sean wasn&#39;t even worth her attention,so nothing he said could unsettle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella reached over and gave her hand a reassuring pat. &#34;You&#39;ve only just come back, and he&#39;s still not used to you. Give it time, and he&#39;ll come around. And if he doesn&#39;t, just tell me, and I&#39;ll set him straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it ever came to that, Eliana knew she could deal with Sean on her own without anyone&#39;s help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of which, Mom...&#34; Carl&#39;s tone shifted as he brought up another matter. &#34;The servants said Damon and Sawyer were taken away too? I thought only Dad was involved. Neither of them has anything to do with politics, so why would they get dragged into it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh escaped Stella. &#34;They clashed with the officers who came for your father. I&#39;ve already brought in a lawyer, and Rowell is looking into it as well. They should be out soon.&#34; &#34;Rowell? Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be on set with the crew?&#34; Carl asked, visibly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With the family in this mess, there was no way he could stay there. He came back yesterday,&#34; Stella answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s thoughts shifted, and he asked, &#34;What about Harold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella replied, &#34;Actually, Harold doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s happening here. He&#39;s still abroad right now, giving medical aid. Leave him out of this for the moment.His work there matters more than anything, and l don&#39;t want him distracted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface,the Murray family looked like they were drowning in trouble, but in truth, it was nothing more than a carefully staged trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That truth, however, was something Stella had no intention of sharing with them yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl took a moment to think, then asked, &#34;Then tell me what I can do.&#34; &#34;Start preparing for Lia&#39;s welcome party in three days. Since she&#39;s decided to stay, we&#39;ll mark her return properly and make sure everyone knows who she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Carl&#39;s eyes flicked toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the unspoken concern, Eliana quickly suggested, &#34;Mom, I&#39;ll go get your medicine ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing that Carl wanted a private word, Stella gave a short nod. &#34;Alright. Jordy, take Eliana to the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. This way, please,&#34; Jordy said politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Eliana stepped out and the door shut behind her, Carl spoke in a low voice. &#34;With the family in its current state, a party might not draw much of a crowd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware of that. It&#39;s their choice to attend or not.What matters is that Eliana receives the welcome she deserves. She&#39;s endured more than enough already,and I won&#39;t have her slighted,&#34; replied Stella, her tone unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also saw the party as a quiet test. Those who showed up would be remembered, and those who didn&#39;t would have their absence noted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl gave a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure everything&#39;s ready. And get Eliana&#39;s room in order so she can settle in comfortably. She&#39;s endured enough already, and no matter what we&#39;re facing, she deserves to be looked after,&#34; Stella said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry, Mom. I&#39;ll handle it. You&#39;ve been keeping it clean every week, so she can move in whenever she wants,&#34; Carl responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Stella gave a small nod, her mind was far from settled. She pulled out her phone and began browsing for clothes and daily necessities she thought Eliana might need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of the worn, outdated outfit Eliana had been wearing earlier brought a sharp ache to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, she hadn&#39;t had the chance to care for her daughter properly. But now that Eliana was home-even though her own health was still fragile-Stella felt an urgent need to make up for lost time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While scrolling, her lips would curve into a smile, only for her eyes to mist over seconds later, the emotions coming in waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another part of the house, Eliana was measuring herbs for Stella&#39;s medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since her daughter had gone missing, Stella&#39;s health had never been the same, so the household always kept a steady supply of medicinal plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made gathering the ingredients a simple task for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it simmer gently for about an hour,&#34; she told Jordy before making her way toward Stella&#39;s room. On the way, her attention drifted to her phone. She began reviewing the report about the Murray family that Seth Baxter, one of her subordinates, had sent over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his arrest, Louis had been an influential figure in Qidence. His six sons, however, seemed far less impressive-especially Damon Murray, the firstborn,who had been born with a condition that confined him to a wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth&#39;s messages kept coming in a rush. &#34;The Murray family&#39;s done for. If you see any signs of trouble, get out before they drain you dry. If they&#39;re anything like the Holts, you&#39;re in for a world of problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was brief-&#34;Okay&#34;-before she slipped her phone awvay and headed up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of dealing with people like Janessa had taught her never to lower her guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she knew exactly what kind of people she was dealing with, she had no intention of revealing anything personal. For now, the plan was simple-use her identity as the Murray family&#39;s long-lost daughter to secure a smooth relocation of the Onyx Syndicate to Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway down the hall, a sharp, pained gasp caught her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped, turned the handle, and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight waiting for her was Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to pour himself a glass of water, but the awkward angle of his dislocated arm left him clumsy and pale with sweat. By the time the cup was half full, his face was tight with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creak of the door made him glance up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes landed on Eliana, his expression soured. &#34;What, did you come to watch me suffer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without answering, Eliana walked straight toward him, ignoring the suspicion in his eyes, and took hold of his injured arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Sean tried to pull back, alarmed, but Eliana&#39;s grip was like an eagle&#39;stalon,firm and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dammit,you&#39;re asking for it!&#34; he barked, his voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His left hand lifted to strike Eliana, but the motion stalled as a strange sensation hit him-strength flooding back into his right arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Testing his wrist, he realized the pain had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him then-she had just reset his joint without a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he looked up, Eliana was already walking out the door.</p>
