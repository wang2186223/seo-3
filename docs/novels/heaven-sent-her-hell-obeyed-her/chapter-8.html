                <p>Sean opened his mouth to call Eliana back, but she had already slipped through the doorway and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>disappeared without saying anything, leaving him staring blankly for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while ago, he had thought she was nothing but a nuisance. Now, the thought crossed his mind that maybe she wasn&#39;t as intolerable as he believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, his resolve to bring Leyla back solidified all over again. In his mind, Leyla was still his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flexing his newly restored arm, his eyes drifted toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His room sat on the second floor. It wasn&#39;t high enough to worry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, he slid the lock on the door, crossed to the wwindow, and leapt down. From what he knew, Leyla was probably staying at the Clarkes&#39; estate. Her fiancé, Hector Clarke, was the eldest son of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what it took, Sean was determined to bring Leyla back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Carl and Stella clearly favoring Eliana, he had no reason to rely on their words. The truth was something he needed to see with his own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Eliana returned to Stella&#39;s room, Stella had already drifted into a deep sleep, her fingers still curled protectively around her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana carefully eased it from her hand to set it on the bedside table, but the glowing screen caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messages showed Stella asking someone to send over a selection of the newest clothing styles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint warmth touched Eliana&#39;s chest. She pulled the blanket up over Stella&#39;s shoulders and slipped out of the room in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone lit up with a new message from Seth. It contained the location for the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s medical mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text read, &#34;I&#39;ve already spoken with the Clarke family.You can head over whenever you&#39;re ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going now,&#34; Eliana replied, then went to find Carl to mention she wanted to step out for a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me come with you. You don&#39;t know this place well, and I&#39;d hate for you to get lost,&#34; Carl said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana responded by giving an address, &#34;No. 1 Manor,Oak Avenue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the Murray famnily&#39;s own address, her way of saying she could find her way back without trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl rubbed at his temple. &#34;Fine, but be back before it gets dark. And if anything happens, call me. I&#39;ll fix up your room while you&#39;re gone. Oh, here-my bank card. There&#39;s over a million on it. Use it for whatever you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need it. I&#39;ve got money,&#34; said Eliana,waving off the offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a chance to return it, Carl pressed the card into her palm. &#34;Come on, how much could you really have? Don&#39;t be so polite. Buy yourself something you actually like. That outfit you&#39;re wearing is worn out. Go to the mall and pick something better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had even the slightest idea what women preferred, he might have bought it for her himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved in a faint smile as she slipped the card into her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the Murray family&#39;s cars were far too noticeable, she decided to take a taxi instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About thirty minutes later, she was stepping through the doors of an herbal pharmacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are the herbs I need,&#34; she said. The shopkeeper accepted the list and studied Eliana with a wary look. &#34;Young lady, these are no ordinary herbs. That Goosegrass you&#39;ve written down-it&#39;s the rarest thing we have. Only one stalk left. Half a million for that alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money won&#39;t be an issue,&#34; Eliana responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shopkeeper&#39;s eyes ran over her again. The worn-out, faded clothes she wore looked like something not even the poorest in Qidence would bother with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he noticed that, he scoffed and waved her away.&#34;Stop wasting my time. This is a serious shop, not a playground. Go before you cause trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, a tall, well-dressed woman appeared in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the shopkeeper&#39;s expression brightened,and he stepped past Eliana to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome, Ms. Clarke! Picking up prescription again?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe gave a small nod. &#34;Yes. The usual prescription, but add a stalk of Goosegrass this time. I heard you&#39;ve got one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, you really know your herbs! We do have it, but it&#39;s... quite expensive,&#34; he said, drawing out the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s brow lifted. &#34;And you think I can&#39;t afford it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! I&#39;ll have your order ready right away!&#34;the shopkeeper replied with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned toward the storeroom, only to feel a slim but unyielding hand clamp onto his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, he spun around to find Eliana still standing there. Irritation flashed across his face. &#34;Why are yoU still here? Leave now, or I&#39;ll call the police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That stalk of Goosegrass should go to me. I asked for it first,&#34; Eliana said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s eyes slid toward her, taking in the messy hair and worn clothes before a low, cold laugh slipped past her lips. She taunted, &#34;You dare to challenge me for Goosegrass? Who exactly do you think you are? You don&#39;t even know who you&#39;re talking to, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First come, first served,&#34; Eliana replied without so much as a blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe let out a short, amused breath. &#34;Cameron,since when do you let beggars shop here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shopkeeper, Cameron Garrett, shook his head quickly. &#34;Absolutely not. She came out of nowhere,and I&#39;ll deal with her right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare hardened as he turned on Eliana and barked, &#34;This is your last warning. Leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana remained unfazed, repeating, &#34;First come, first served.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34;Cameron&#39;s voice rose, ready to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could, Khloe snapped her fingers, and two tall bodyguards strode in as if they&#39;d been waiting for the cue. Tilting her chin toward Eliana, Khloe gave the order.&#34;Help Cameron remove this beggar from my sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away!&#34; Without hesitation, the two advanced on Eliana, their expressions hard as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before their hands could land on her, Eliana&#39;s foot shot upward in a swift arc, her kick slamming one guard into the wall so hard the shelves rattled. He crumpled to the floor, clutching his side and groaning, unable to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second guard&#39;s eyes narrowed. His grip on the stun baton tightened before he swung it toward her with brutal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blow like that to the head could have been deadly.Khloe, however, looked on without the slightest concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Eliana was nothing more than a nobody.lf the police got involved, the Clarke family&#39;s influence would tip the scales in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought brought a cold curve to her lips as she st waited to see Eliana flattened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Eliana&#39;s leg lashed out again, knocking the baton clean from his hand. His fingers throbbed from the impact, and he winced in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but marvel at her speed and raw power, a suspicion forming that she must have ties to the Fist Guild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he had the chance to move, Eliana seized his collar and slammed him hard against the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burst of blood streamed from his forehead, and his body went limp in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe froze for a heartbeat before stumbling backward a few steps. &#34;Who are you? I&#39;m warning you, I&#39;m a Clarke. You&#39;ll regret crossing me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze stayed as cold and steady as a winter pond, her eyelids lifting only slightly at the mention of the Clarke name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the bloodied bodyguard drop and shifted her attention to Cameron, who stared at her as if he couldn&#39;t believe what he&#39;d just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you sell me the Goosegrass or not?&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|-I...&#34; Cameron&#39;s voice faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s face hardened, and she cut in sharply.&#34;Cameron, if you hand that over to her, I&#39;ll see to it your shop&#39;s doors never open again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron&#39;s shoulders trembled. Just as he was about to speak, he felt Eliana&#39;s piercing gaze fix on him. His throat tightened as he swallowed, and in that moment, his decision was made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, he said, &#34;Half a million for a single stalk of Goosegrass. Can you pay it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question was for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her wrist, she placed a sleek black bank card on the counter. &#34;Go ahead,charge it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skepticism lingered on Cameron&#39;s face as he slid the card through the card machine, yet the screen confirmed the half-million transaction without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll fetch it right away,&#34; he blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged in Khloe&#39;s voice. &#34;Cameron, have you lost your mind?! Do you actually want to throw your business away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron didn&#39;t bother replying. He strode into the storeroom, returned with every herb Eliana had requested, and presented them to her with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Survival came first. No sum was worth gambling with his own life. Besides, the sale alone could keep him comfortable for a long while. If it came to it, moving elsewhere and starting fresh was far better than dying where he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in him knew that Eliana had the means to end him without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana took the herbs, slipped the bank card back into her pocket, and walked out without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe stepped forward fast enough to cut her off. &#34;You&#39;re not walking out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze swept over her coldly. &#34;Do you honestly think you can stop me over this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That piercing glare was so forceful, Khloe&#39;s voice faltered before she could muster a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only two bodyguards flanked her, and neither could stand against Eliana. Without the slightest combat skill herself, her chances were nonexistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Khloe went silent, Eliana clutched the bundle of herbs tighter and strode out of the pharmacy without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation burned through Khloe, and her jaw tightened until her teeth ached. She etched the moment deep into memory, vowing that the next time their paths crossed, she would make her pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron stammered cautiously, &#34;Ms. Clarke...there&#39;s another herb with properties close to Goosegrass...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Khloe shot him a sharp glare. &#34;Your pharmacy will be shut down tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lashed out at the bloodied bodyguard with a swift kick. &#34;Worthless! Get up and keep moving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missing out on the Goosegrass would earn her parents&#39; wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The miracle doctor they had secured would be arriving soon, and the person&#39;s instructions had been clear: they wanted Goosegrass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe had to move quickly, searching other herbal shops before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Neal sat waiting in the car, ready to drive her to the next ddestination.</p>
