                <p>Barry had barely closed his mouth when Tristan&#39;s eyes turned cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doran traded a knowing smirk with Rocco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them thought Barry had the nerve to go head-to-head with Tristan over Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like your ears aren&#39;t working too well,&#34; Tristan remarked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Barry could respond, Doran, standing at his right, swung his hand in a quick arc and landed a crisp slap across his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound cracked, and Barry&#39;s ear rang so hard it felt like it might burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward with deceptive calm, Tristan asked, &#34;Does that help your hearing any?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I...&#34; Barry stammered, his eyes darting to Eliana as though she might save him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed tight, and the insult in her gaze was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kindly escort this fool out of here,&#34; she told Doran and Rocco, turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gladly!&#34; Doran answered. He didn&#39;t bother waiting for Rocco, grabbing Barry by the collar and hauling him toward the manor gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your hands off me!&#34; Barry squirmed against his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Doran&#39;s hand shot out and struck the back of Barry&#39;s neck, knocking him unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air went still again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Tristan wanted a private word with Eliana, Rocco quickened his pace to help Doran haul the unconscious body away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they reached the gates, Doran asked,where&#39;s the drop-off point for him?&#34; Rocco&#39;s gaze swept over Barry with open disgust. &#34;Send him back to wherever he crawled from. Wno does he think hecompeting with Mr.Pearson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1&#39; rough him upfirst, then dump him at the White family&#39;s doorstepDoran replied with a short nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure the beating happens far from Ms. Murray&#39;s property,&#34; Rocco warned. &#34;Her home shouldn&#39;t be tainted by this trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana still couldn&#39;t bring herself to meet Tristan&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat awkwardly and muttered,&#34;Thanks for stepping in,&#34;then made for the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their shoulders nearly brushed when Tristan&#39;s hand caught her wrist.&#34;Ms. Murray, aren&#39;t you forgetting to explain something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden grip left Eliana with no choice but to turn toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight painted his features in silver, making him look even sharper.than he had in daylight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she wasn&#39;t admiring him. She was looking for a way out. A pang of regret hit her for lying earlier. Being caught in it now made her stomach twist. She cleared her throat once more and said, &#34;You already figured out my identity, right? Is there something else you need to hear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was hiding who you are just a way to trick me into ending our engagement?&#34; Tristan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brows drew together. &#34;Trick you into backing out? You were ready to call it off yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan froze for a split second before blurting out, &#34;I had no idea you were the one promised to me since young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark made her lips twitch in faint amusement. With a sharp tug, she freed her hand from his hold. Her voice turned cold. &#34;So what? If you&#39;d known it was me, would that have changed anything? Don&#39;t forget your girlfriend waiting for you at your place. Or has she slipped your mind already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan was taken aback.&#34;What girlfriend?&#34; Her contempt only deepened. It seemed every man really was the same, cold and heartless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without softening, she fixed her gaze on him. &#34;Do you enjoy pretending you don&#39;t have a girlfriend, or is that just second nature by now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s confusion only seemed to grow. &#34;I&#39;m not pretending. I really don&#39;t have a girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Eliana&#39;s voice faltered, ready to turn sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Carl&#39;s voice rang out from across the lawn. &#34;Lia? Is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stopped mid-sentence and lifted a hand to signal him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Carl closed the gap, a grin on his face. &#34;We&#39;ve been searching all over. Mom&#39;s ready to make the formal introductions...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he caught his breath did Carl notice the figure standing a step behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s black suit blended so well with the evening shadows that Carl had nearly missed him. There was something about the man&#39;s presence that seemed to pull the air tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered in Carl&#39;s eyes. &#34;Mr. Pearson, didn&#39;t expect to see you out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze shifted toward Eliana, and he replied, &#34;I stepped out for air and took a wrong turn. Luckily,your sister happened to find me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a point of stressing the words &#34;your sister&#34; when he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders tensed, and she quickly turned to Carl.Mom looking for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Nearly everyone&#39;s here, and shę&#39;s ready to present you,&#34; replied Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s head back,&#34; she told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl agreed with a short nod before turning to Tristan. &#34;Mr. Pearson, come along. We&#39;ll lead you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a faint nod and trailed after them into the main house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer was the first to cross their path. &#34;Lia, there you are. We&#39;ve been searching everywhere. Where did you Tun off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just needed a breath of fresh air. It was getting stifling inside,&#34; Eliana answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling any better now?&#34; Sawyer&#39;s voice held genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She gave a brief nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. You&#39;d better go see Mom,&#34; Sawyer told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a glance toward Tristan, she moved off toward Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men followved close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer caught sight of Tristan walking in with them, Leaning closer to Carl, he kept his tone low.&#34;Mind telling me why Mr. Pearson was tagging along with you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl replied, &#34;He got lost. It&#39;s not like this place is a maze, but he still wandered off. Guess a good sense of direction isn&#39;t part of that big-shot reputation of his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lost?&#34; Sawyer&#39;s brow knit as suspicion flickered in his eyes. He turned his head almost by instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By chance, Tristan was already looking back. Their eyes met, and a subtle weight settled over the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer forced a strained smile and offered a short nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan answered with a quiet one of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, Sawyer couldn&#39;t shake the thought that a man like Tristan shouldn&#39;t be the type to get turned around so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with the evening still unfolding, he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from them, Stella exchanged a few quiet words with Eliana before guiding her toward the center of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raised platform waited, a microphone gleaming under the lights. Stella stepped forward, greeting the guests with a few warm words before her tone softened. °This is my daughter, Eliana. When she was only three, I lost her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered, emotion catching in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana rested a gentle hand on her back. Stella drew in a steady breath, smiling faintly before continuing,&#34;But fortune smiled on me, and I was given the chance to find her again. I&#39;ve dreamed of hosting this welcome-home banquet for so many years, and now that dream is finally real. Lia, from this day on, we will never be apart again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Eliana answered,&#34;Yes.We&#39;ll stay together forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room filled with applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While some offered genuine congratulations, most cast curious glances toward Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they saw him clapping, they quickly joined in, the sound swelling as though each wanted to outdo the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the banquet drew to a close, and Tristan made his way toward Stella.</p>
