                <p>Eliana was startled by Tristan&#39;s sudden comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, she relaxed when she realized he was only talking about her paintings. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I never imagined Riley could be a woman.Even more surprising-you&#39;re Riley,&#34; Tristan remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shrugged. &#34;Painting&#39;s just a hobby. I&#39;ve never really mentioned it to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Frieda&#39;s stunt today hadn&#39;t happened, she wouldn&#39;t have revealed her identity at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But who taught you to paint?&#34; Tristan asked, curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave him a sideways glance. &#34;You seem to enjoy digging into people&#39;s backgrounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just curious,&#34; he replied easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Curiosity killed the cat. Haven&#39;t you heard of the old saying?&#34; Eliana asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fortunately, I&#39;m not a cat,&#34; he said with a smirk</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let that one go. There were things she didn&#39;t plan on telling anyone-not</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even Seth or Kathy-like who her mentor was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some secrets were better kept to herself. If it was made public, she could be considered a freak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she changed the subject. &#34;Where exactly are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had already left the main conference area,walking down a quieter corridor lined with closed doors. The carpet beneath their feet was thick,patterned in intricate swirls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Eliana had designed the building, it was her first time visiting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stopped and looked at her. &#34;To help me out-as my companion,&#34; he said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed. &#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are plenty of guests here today, but the ones who really matter are in this area. I need you to fend someone off for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still not following.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll understand soon enough. When the time comes, just play along,&#34; he said as he stopped in front of a door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft click, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana looked up and found herself staring into a spacious living room, light streaming in from a massive floor-to-ceiling window. Well-dressed men and women clustered in small groups, chatting over drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of all the faces,she recognized only one-Hector,Leyla&#39;s boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by the way he was running around with a coffee pot,his standing here wasn&#39;t all that impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The coffee beans here aren&#39;t a the best,&#34; Hector said with a respectful smile as he handed a cup to a middle -aged man. &#34;Mayor Oliver, since you enjoy coffee, I&#39;ll invite you and your daughter to Galaxy Café sometime.They have a much better brew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert nodded politely. &#34;Sure. I&#39;ve heard of that place,but never been there. I&#39;m swamped with a critical case right now-no time to slip away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s brows lifted. &#34;Is this case tied to the previous mayor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was clearly hinting at Sheldon Torres. That scandal even implicated Louis. Rupert ignored him, turning instead to a short-haired young woman at his side. &#34;Celine, if you&#39;re free, go have coffee with Hector. If it&#39;s good, bring back some beans for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine nodded eagerly. &#34;Alright, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door opened wider and Tristan stepped in with Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their arrival drew every eye in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine Oliver&#39;s eyes lit up at the sight of Tristan-until she noticed Eliana beside him. Her expression tightened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, you&#39;re finally here,&#34; a man near the door said with a smile, walking over. &#34;I heard there was a commotion outside. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a misunderstanding. It&#39;s handled,&#34; Tristan replied smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. We were about to come check.&#34; The man appeared relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. Really, it was nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s eyes shifted to Eliana. &#34;And this is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could answer, Tristan slipped his hand into hers. &#34;This is my fiancée, Eliana Murray.&#34; Eliana&#39;s first instinct was to pull back, but Tristan&#39;s grip only tightened, leaving her no choice but to play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a quick look, catching on to whatever game he was playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a sigh, she decided to play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She owed him, after all. There was no way out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s brows rose in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he quickly regained his composure and greeted Eliana warmly, &#34;Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Murray.Tristan&#39;s mentioned a fiancée before, but we didn&#39;t believe him. Now I see why he locked it down so early -if I were him, I&#39;d have done the same. You&#39;re such a beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana forced a polite smile, about to respond when Tristan&#39;s voice cut in-cool and sharp. &#34;Mr. Miller,you&#39;re pushing fifty. Maybe skip those kinds of jokes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab was veiled in humor, but the chill underneath was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy Miller&#39;s smile faltered. He opened his mouth to explain,but Tristan was already steering Eliana toward Rupert. &#34;Mayor Oliver,let me introduce-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard. No need to repeat,&#34; Rupert interrupted,his tone frosty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Celine&#39;s face had gone pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t need an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Tristan said he needed her help, she thought it might be something serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turns out, she was here to block his admirer. He could&#39;ve warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her irritation spiked. She dug her nails into his hand,hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t so much as flinch,still wearing that calm,unbothered smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not right. Introductions should be done properly. This is my fiancée, Eliana Murray. Eliana, this is Mayor Rupert Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t the type to butter up someone who clearly disliked her-not even for show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a brief nod. &#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert&#39;s expression darkened further. Sensing the tension, others hurried to change the subject,drawing Rupert into safer conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan guided Eliana to an empty chair and poured her a cup of coffee himself. &#34;Sit. Have some coffee and snacks. No need to be formal-everyone here knows each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered him a stiff smile and took the cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,Tristan was pulled into a separate discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, knowing she was almost invisible in this setting,stayed quiet and sipped her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector had remarked earlier that the coffee was stale,but to her, it was pleasant-mellow, with the faintest sweet aftertaste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me-your last name&#39;s Murray, isn&#39;t it?&#34; a woman&#39;s voice suddenly came from beside her.</p>
