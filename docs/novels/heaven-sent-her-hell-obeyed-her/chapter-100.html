                <p>Each breath became harder for Anaya to draw, her face darkening to a dangerous shade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as if Tristan would crush the life from her, but before that became reality, two shadows rushed inand tore him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Air came flooding back-Anaya gasped, desperate for oxygen, chest heaving like someone who&#39;d just surfaced from drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp sting in her lungs reminded her she&#39;d never truly valued every breath until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the struggle, Rocco and Doran clung to Tristan, straining against his raw power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s fury bordered on uncontrollable, forcing both men to use every ounce of strength just to keep him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, please-this isn&#39;t the way,&#34; Rocco persuaded, voice tense. &#34;If you end up killing her, how do we ever explain that to Hector?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous chill flickered in Tristan&#39;s gaze. &#34;Hector? Since when do I owe him any explanation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco tried to reason further, holding firm. &#34;I know, but think it through-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Release me,&#34; Tristan snapped, his patience gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty made Rocco hesitate, but he held his ground.&#34;Sirwe-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan exhaled sharply, the fight draining from his shoulders.sover. I&#39;m done. I won&#39;t kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, he&#39;d been ready to end Anaya then and there-not only for planting doubts in Eliana&#39;s mind, but because he had no patience for schemers who thrived on chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once before, it was another scheme that forced Elbert&#39;s hand-he&#39;d sent Tristan off to Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Anaya&#39;s antics touched a nerve Tristanrarely let anyone see. Even so, he never allowed rage to cloud his judgment. Everything he&#39;d just done was calculated-just enough to remind Anaya where she stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent exchange passed between Doran and Rocco, and at last, they loosened their grip on Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his word, Tristan stepped back, making no move to harm Anaya further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he let go than Anaya hurried to his side, gratitude spilling from her lips. &#34;Thank you for your mercy.I swear,you&#39;ll never have trouble from me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped Tristan, eyes glittering with disdain. &#34;Taking your life wouldn&#39;t be worth the trouble.Doran, make sure she returns to, Clarkes&#39; estate in style-she&#39;s earned a mountain of gifts for her week in my company. Let&#39;s show our appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Doran&#39;s face. How could Tristan&#39;s mood flip from lethal to lavish in a heartbeat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco,on the other hand, caught on instantly-he knew Tristan well enough to recognize the strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allow me, sir,&#34; Rocco suggested smoothly, already making plans to carry out the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t waste another word-he simply turned and disappeared into his suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a daze, Anaya barely had time to process what happened before she was whisked away, dressed in new clothes and seated in the back of a sleek car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco supervised as boxes of extravagant gifts piled into the trunk, turning the trip into something resembling a royal procession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion warred with pleasure inside Anaya. Since when did Tristan show generosity, and why direct it at her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when she arrived at the Clarke estate did the reason begin to take shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector stood waiting, eyes hardening as he surveyed the bounty of gifts and the smug smile on Anaya&#39;s face.&#34;Explain yourself.Why would Tristan send you back like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anaya stammered, &#34;I have no idea. He&#39;s impossible to read-I can never guess what&#39;s on his mind.&#34; A bitter laugh escaped Hector before he stepped closer, gripping her chin in his hand. &#34;You really don&#39;t get it? Here&#39;s the truth-Tristan wants you here to keep tabs on me. You&#39;re supposed to run back and spill every secret.Isn&#39;t that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anaya recoiled,genuine shock widening her eyes.that&#39;s not what this is about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smirk twisted across his face. &#34;Not true? Since when did Tristan develop a charitable streak? Drop the act. I&#39;ve seen women like you before-always gravitating toward power. Don&#39;t waste your time plotting.Whatever you&#39;re up to, it won&#39;t work on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice settled in Anaya&#39;s chest. &#34;That&#39;s not fair! I haven&#39;t done anything. Tristan never asked me to spy,and I would never betray your trust...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of his hand, Hector shoved her away, distaste clear in every movement. &#34;Get her out of my sight.If she won&#39;t come clean, there&#39;s no reason to keep her around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood!&#34; His guards wasted no time, grabbing hold of Anaya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rising, she pleaded desperately, &#34;Please, you have to believe me! I&#39;m loyal-I would never cross you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. Take her away,&#34; Hector snapped,turning his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragged down the hall, Anaya finally understood the truth behind Tristan&#39;s generous farewNell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gifts weren&#39;t kindness at all-they were part of his plan to paint her as a traitor and set Hector against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d tried to poison Eliana&#39;s relationship with Tristan, only for him to repay her in kind-turning her into a wedge between herself and Hector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeds of mistrust were all Tristan needed to scatter. Hector&#39;s suspicious nature did the rest. Doubt once planted would take root and spread-Hector would never look at her the same way again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much for kindness; this was retribution, pure and simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the chaos faded and Anaya was dragged away, a tense silence settled over the room. Peace brought Hector no comfort-restlessness gnawed at him even more. For years, Anaya had been nothing but a pawn, usefulfor luring and intimidating the influential. Now, he was forced to destroy his own chess piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden commotion broke his thoughts. One of his men hurried in, voice low but urgent. &#34;Mr. Clarke,Ms.Murray has arrived and wishes to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, hope flickered in Hector&#39;s eyes. He leaned forward, anticipation sharpening his tone.&#34;Who are we talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Leyla Murray, sir,&#34; the man answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment hit hard-Hector&#39;s mood turned icy in an instant. &#34;Send her away. I don&#39;t want to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messenger hesitated, uncertain, but finally delivered Leyla&#39;s stubborn response. &#34;She says she&#39;s not leaving, no matter what you decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile played on Hector&#39;s lips. &#34;Then let her wait. If she&#39;s that determined, let&#39;s see how long she lasts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exits lined every corridor of the estate, and Hector found it mildly amusing-if Leyla managed to corner him,she would deserve some recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of the humiliation she caused him at the exhibition hall flashed across his mind, souring whatever warmth he once felt for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Leyla stood out-beautiful, refined, the pride of the Murray family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, all he saw was a liability-someone whose presence brought nothing but shame and inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, a chill crept into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Autumn&#39;s approach sharpened the wind, each gust slicing through the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours slipped by as Leyla stood rooted at the gates, her body aching, legs numb from standing so long. Not a single servant appeared to offer her entry. Stubbornness anchored her in place. Pride refused to let her walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely Hector hadn&#39;t erased every feeling for her-not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could just look him in the eye, she&#39;d explain what really happened, undo the damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But dawn arrived, painting the sky gray. The gates never moved. The house behind them remained silent and closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla shivered in the predawn chill, rubbing her numb fingers together in a futile attempt to ward off the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered when a servant finally appeared at the gates-but it died the moment she heard the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of Hector&#39;s departure hit Leyla like a slap. &#34;He&#39;s gone?&#34; Disbelief colored her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you should be on your way as well,&#34; the servant replied, his words clipped and final before he vanished inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of anger threatened to spill over, but Leyla kept her composure, refusing to give the staff the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she convinced herself this was just a temporary setback. Hector&#39;s temper would cool eventually-he always forgave her in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinging to that hope, she trudged across town, determined to take refuge in the apartment Hector had once arranged for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration mounted as she jabbed the keypad repeatedly, each failed attempt greeted by an unforgiving beep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, she rang the housekeeper-only tohear that she was gone and the place was already up for sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock left Leyla reeling. The home she once shared with Hector had been stripped away, just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her accounts empty and every asset sold to cover mounting debts, Leyla found herself forced to check into a bland hotel. Just as despair began to settle in, her phone vibrated-a voice message from Jonny, gentle and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to know if her injured wrist was feeling any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile. An idea began to take shape.</p>
