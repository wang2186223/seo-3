                <p>As Leyla rode her wave of excitement, she suddenly noticed Jeffry glancing back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened in her seat, recognizing that look-his nod of approval, granting her the opportunity she&#39;d been hoping for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flutter of nerves stirred in her chest, even as her pulse raced with anticipation. But reminding herself that today&#39;s contestants weren&#39;t on her level, she quickly calmed her racing heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the hall was cleared, and contestants filed in one after another based on their registration numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In search of fresh talent, Pearson Group had placed an age cap on entries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, none of the veteran artists were eligible -only fresh-faced newcomers like Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she walked in, Hector had fussed over her,reminding, &#34;My dad&#39;s staying till the results are announced. Don&#39;t let him down, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla said confidently, &#34;Relax, I&#39;ve got this.&#34; Hector nodded, pressed a kiss to her forehead, and watched her disappear inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Davin himself had recommended Leyla, and she&#39;d completed her registration early,she was given a seat near the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she sat down, she closed her eyes and replayed in her mind one of Carl&#39;s paintings-the one she had hopes of mimicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her recall was impressive; with her eyes shut, it was as though the painting itself hung right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied little smile appeared on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she opened her eyes again... she froze.There, seated at the very center of the judges&#39; panel,were Tristan-and Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes widened. Eliana... was on the judges &#39;panel? WWould this affect her chances of winning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, she squared her shoulders and abruptly rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Larry, one of the judges, noticed her standing and frowned. &#34;Young lady, the competition is about to start. Please take your seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana instinctively followed his line of sight. That was  when she met Leyla&#39;s glare-sharp, openly dissatisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted a brow, immediately sensing that Leyla&#39;s issue was directed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Leyla spoke up the next moment,her voice loud and carrying, &#34;Mr. Craig, I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;d like to say something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she was Davin&#39;s newly accepted student,Larry indulged her, &#34;Very well-please speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Before I came in, I was told outsiders weren&#39;t allowed entry. So why is she here?And why is she sitting on the judges&#39; panel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she pointed boldly at Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver. She had already guessed Leyla&#39;s irritation was aimed her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, however, immediately frowned beside her, his face turning cold. &#34;Who said she&#39;s unrelated to the competition?&#34; His voice was firm and icy. &#34;I invited her to be a judge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla subconsciously shrank from his intense stare-but thinking of her ambition, she forced herself to stand tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Pearson, I know you&#39;re close to her, but this is a serious competition. How can you let someone who  knows nothing about oil-painting sit as a judge?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the room. They didn&#39;t expect Leyla not to know that the internationally famed Riley was Eliana&#39;s pseudonym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling countless eyes fixed on her, Leyla&#39;s confidence began to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very back, Carl almost shot to his feet when he heard Leyla challenging Eliana. But before he could speak, Eliana gave him the smallest shake of her head.With effort,he swallowed his temper and relaxed back in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana finally looked at Leyla again-not angry,simply cool-and gave a light laugh. &#34;If someone finds my presence inappropriate, I&#39;ll step down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully,she hadn&#39;t wanted to be judge in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only agreed after Tristan, Larry, and Davin had pleaded with her, over and over, to join the judges &#39; panel. Not having to sit there wasting her day was,frankly, preferable in her opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana rose to her feet, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin quickly reached out and gently stopped her,leaning in to whisper, &#34;Please don&#39;t mind her. She&#39;s my newest student and doesn&#39;t know who you are my  mentor. I&#39;ll talk to her afterward!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your student?&#34; Eliana lifted her brows.genuinely surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes... why?&#34; Davin looked confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shook her head, her tone carrying a quiet,layered meaning. &#34;You really are getting old-your judgment is slipping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin looked even more lost. &#34;What? I seriously don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to,&#34; Eliana replied lightly. &#34;You&#39;ll figure it out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned towards Tristan and said, &#34;I&#39;ll wait outside until the competition&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a single nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, he stood up as well. &#34;This young lady just made me realize I know nothing about oil-painting either-which makes me unqualified to sit on this panel. Mr. Craig, Mr. Gordon, I&#39;ll leave this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he moved to Eliana&#39;s side, the steel in his expression shifting into something warm. &#34;Come on.We&#39;ll leave together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana frowned slightly. &#34;You really don&#39;t have to...&#34; Tristan lowered his voice. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one who doesn&#39;t feel like wasting time in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana pressed her lips together, choosing not to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two walked out in tow, leaving the remaining judges exchanging baffled glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Larry and Davin&#39;s expressions darkened-Davin&#39;s most of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he didn&#39;t fully understand Eliana&#39;s earlier comment,Leyla&#39;s attitude toward her had clearly crossed a line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla was only his newly taken-in student.Eliana,on the other hand, was someone he had respected and admired for years. His teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, knowing Leyla had spoken out of ignorance,he swallowed his anger-for now-intending to reprimand her properly once the competition ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the displeasure in his gaze was hard to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla could feel it-the displeasure in Davin&#39;s gaze-and a wave of indignation rose in her chest. Why was he siding with Eliana, an outsider?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately,she found a reason to console herself. Davin must simply be upset that Tristan had  walked out as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she wasn&#39;t worried. Once the competition was over, she would tell Davin the truth-that Eliana was Louis&#39;s daughter who had been bullying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at that time, a principled and righteous man like Davin, no matter how close Eliana was to Tristan,would surely not stand on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t only the judges&#39; panel that was upset with Leyla. The contestants were equally displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley leaving was one thing-but Tristan also walking out was another matter entirely. Most of them didn&#39;t fancy their chances at winning, but they all knew that if Tristan could remember them even a little, it mnight give them an edge when applying for a designer position at Pearson Group later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, thanks to Leyla, even that slim opportunity had vanished. Unable to hold it in, several contestants began venting in low voices</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s such a busybody!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why stick her nose into everything? What does any of that have to do with her?&#34;</p>
