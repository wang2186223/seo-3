                <p>&#34;Please-we&#39;re begging you!&#34; The Clarke couple&#39;s voices carried the weight of desperation, stripped of their usual authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who stumbled upon the sight would have been left gaping. After all, the powerful Clarkes had never been heard speaking with such humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression didn&#39;t soften. Once she set her mind, nothing could move her from it. &#34;I offered you the chance, and you threw it away. You&#39;ve got no one to blame but yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her back on them, letting their pleas fall into the cold air as she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many sought her skills, but she had always practiced medicine by instinct, choosing her patients through the connection she felt with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Clarke family had never stirred even a flicker of that connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a sleek luxury car rolled up to the gates of the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tinted window slid down, revealing Hector, his eyes narrowing at the strange scene-his parents chasing after a woman dressed plainly enough to be mistaken for a beggar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signaled the driver to stop, stepped out, and closed the distance. &#34;Dad, Mom, why are you running after a beggar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s glare could have cut glass. &#34;Beggar? That&#39;s the famed doctor we&#39;ve been searching for!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Hector froze, his gaze locking on Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t truly looked at her before-but now, he couldn&#39;t miss the quiet, striking presence she carried. Even under a dust-covered coat and worn clothing, her eyes gleamed like cut diamonds,impossible to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe you an apology,&#34; Hector said quickly. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize who you were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s tone was cool. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I have no intention of treating anyone in your family anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the Clarke household was full of people who measured worth by appearance alone. And she had no patience for those who were high and mighty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ask me?&#34; Her lips curved into a cold smnile.&#34;Ask your parents instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward stiffness settled over Jeffry&#39;s and Ruby&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby stepped in quickly, spilling out the details of what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Hector heard the whole story, the reason for their frantc chase was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me your price. We can cover it,&#34; he said, his voice steeped in arrogance rather than the humility of someone seeking help. &#34;I&#39;m not short on money,&#34; Eliana answered, her tone cool as she turned to leave. She had no shortage of people seeking her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector wasn&#39;t accustomed to being dismissed so easily. Frustration hardened his voice. &#34;Maybe money isn&#39;t what you need-but it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re lacking compassion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s steps halted. She turned her head, eyes like shards of ice. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint curl tugged at his lips, his words deliberate.&#34;I said you&#39;re missing both compassion and medical ethics. A real doctor&#39;s duty is to save lives. But because our butler refused to let you inside our home, you&#39;d let the patient suffer? Tell me-does someone like you even deserve to call herself a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes narrowed, her expression cool with disdain. It was obvious he was trying to corner her,pressing her into submission with moral guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for him, she had no interest in playing by the rules of morality-so there was nothing for him to hold over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, mocking smile curved her lips. &#34;You&#39;re right.I&#39;m not fit to be a doctor-and I&#39;m even less fit to treat anyone in your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, clearly intent on leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s gaze turned razor-sharp, his voice snapping like a whip. &#34;Stop her! She doesn&#39;t leave until my grandpa is treated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If persuasion wouldn&#39;t work, he&#39;d use force. There was no way she would refuse to treat a patient with enough pressure. In an instant, several bodyguards closed in, forming a ring around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze held nothing but icy calm-these men were nothing she couldn&#39;t handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely shifted her weight to strike when a deep,measured voice cut through the standoff. &#34;Mr.Clarke,care to explain this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head snapped toward the sound, Eliana&#39;s included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stepped out of the sleek car, his presence immediately filling the space. His height was commanding, his shadow spilling forward until it brushed across Eliana&#39;s shoes like a silent claim. A perfectly tailored suit framed his broad shoulders,buttoned high at the collar, and his steps carried the unhurried confidence of someone accustomed to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance told Eliana this was no ordinary passerby -her instincts rarely misjudged power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry and Ruby&#39;s faces shifted instantly, their postures straightening under a mix of respect and unease. &#34;Mr.Pearson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow arched in mild surprise. Mr. Pearson? As in the Pearson family-the empire that held entire industries in its grip, able to tip the nation&#39;s economy with a single order?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this man wasn&#39;t Jermaine Pearson, the heir she knew. Jermaine had once commissioned the Onyx Syndicate, and she had dealt with him before. The stranger before her was nothing like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly opportunist-that was how she pegged Jermaine, the kind who smiled while reaching for something that wasn&#39;t his. He&#39;d once tried to lure her into working for him, and she hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she&#39;d confuse Jermaine with the man in front of her. Which meant this Pearson was someone else entirely. His exact identity didn&#39;t matter. What mattered was whether he stood with her or with the Clarkes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was their ally, she didn&#39;t care if he came from Eighvale&#39;s most powerful bloodline-she would treat him no differently than the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she studied him with measured calm, Tristan&#39;s gaze was locked on her, as though tracing the edges of a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her pulled at him-an almost hauntíng familiarity. Yet, for a man who never forgot a face, he couldn&#39;t place where or when their paths might have crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The curiosity pricked at him until he finally asked,&#34;Have we met before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a line that could have come straight from a bad romance drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t think so,&#34; she replied, her tone flat as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chill cut through the moment, snapping Tristan out of whatever haze he&#39;d been in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing how it must have sounded, he reined in his expression and said evenly, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I might have confused you with someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry stepped forward with a practiced smile.&#34;Mr.Pearson, if we&#39;d known you were on your way,we would have sent a car to fetch you. Please, this way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Qidence, the Clarke name carried weight. But in Esaton&#39;s business world, the Pearson family&#39;s influence could eclipse entire cities. The last thing the Clarke family wanted was for Tristan to witness them strong-arming a young woman into treating their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for them, he had already taken in the scene-their desperation, their lack of shame, and the woman standing there like an untouchable dove refusing to be caged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a glance at Jeffry&#39;s outstretched arm, Tristan bypassed him and came to a halt in front of Eliana. His gaze held hers, probing. &#34;You&#39;re the famed doctor from Eighvale, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been told the doctor was young. What he hadn&#39;t expected was for her youth to come with such an unshakable presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; am,&#34; she replied simply, without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched his lips. &#34;I&#39;ve been meaning to meet you for some time but never had the chance.Now that I have, I&#39;d like to ask-would you consider treating my father?&#34; Eliana tilted her head slightly. &#34;Your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tristan replied, his voice low but steady. &#34;He&#39;s been unwell. The danger&#39;s passed for now, but his health shifts like the wind-one day stable, the next on the brink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked toward Hector and Jeffry,his words sharpened with intent. &#34;If they can&#39;t muster the respect to request your help properly, then I will. Say the word, and I&#39;ll have a private jet ready to fly you to Eighvale, where you&#39;ll be received with the highest honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer tightened Jeffry&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nerve of Hector-trying to strong-arm Eliana as if she were some street vendor to be bullied. Did he forget she carried the name of the Onyx Syndicate,a name that could crush reputations with a whisper?Disappointment tangled with anger in Jeffry&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector,still caught off guard, hadn&#39;t imagined Tristan would step in and shield her so openly. Shoving his irritation aside, Jeffry forced his expression into something warmer, almost pleading.&#34;Dr. Murray, I owe you an apology. This has all been one terrible misunderstanding. Of course, we&#39;d be honored for you to treat my father. If you&#39;d grant us that favor, I&#39;ll pay triple your original fee. And I swear,from this day forward, my family will hold you in the highest respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana let out a sharp laugh. &#34;A moment ago, you were set on dragging me back by force. And now?What exactly do you call this sudden change of heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry scrambled to cover the misstep. &#34;My son was reckless-blindly so. That&#39;s on me for not raising him better. I&#39;ll see to it that he learns from this. Please don&#39;t let his stupidity sour things between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby skipped the diplomacy. She stepped forward and delivered a stinging slap across Hector&#39;s cheek.&#34;Apologize. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow did its job. Pride swallowed and jaw tight Hector finally inclined his head. &#34;I was wrong. Entirely wrong. I hope you can forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana weighed her options. Triple the original fee was a hard figure to ignore. More importantly,treating a Clarke could elevate her reputation in the city quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she gave her verdict. &#34;Where&#39;s the patient? Take me to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief swept through the Clarkes like a gust of wind.Jeffry moved quickly, saying, &#34;It&#39;s my father. He&#39;s at home.Please-this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expression unreadable, Eliana fell into step behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Tristan&#39;s gaze lingered on her retreating figure. That nagging sense of familiarity refused to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana turned unexpectedly and offered Tristan a small nod, something in his chest shifted-lightened,even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned the gesture and closed the distance, choosing to follow.</p>
