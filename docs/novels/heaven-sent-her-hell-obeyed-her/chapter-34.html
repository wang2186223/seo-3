                <p>Brenda carried the bloodline of Zach White.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Eighvale, Zach had waged war against the Onyx Syndicate for years, striking both in the open and from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d even been the first to formally petition the government to erase the syndicate entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the biggest blows against them landed, his hand had always been in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder the name Brenda rang a bell-she was Zach&#39;s one and only treasured daughnter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze sharpened, a predator&#39;s glint in her eyes.&#34;In that case,it&#39;s time to settle both old scores and new ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl blinked, startled. &#34;Old and new? What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she&#39;d said too much, Eliana muttered,&#34;Nothing important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Lia, whatever&#39;s running through your head, don&#39;t go charging in. Our family isn&#39;t what it used to be. The Whites could crush us with a single move. We wait until Dad&#39;s out before doing anything,understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax,&#34; Eliana replied with a faint smile. &#34;I know where the line is. I&#39;m not about to lose my head over this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl finally let out a long breath. &#34;Right now, nothing matters more to this family than keeping you safe. As long as you&#39;re fine, we can all breathe easier. Just promise me you won&#39;t let anything like that mess with the Clarke family happen again. You were lucky to cure Miguel, but if something had gone wrong,you could have...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile. &#34;I understand,Carl. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew his concern for her was genuine and she appreciated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the feud with the White family went far beyond Damon. It was a matter that touched the Onyx Syndicate as well. That grudge had been written in her mind long before this, and now there was simply another tally added to the list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reason for Carl to hear any of this. For people like him, knowledge wasn&#39;t protection-it was a liability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps sounded from the staircase, drawing Eliana&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer appeared, dressed in clean clothes that gave him the look of an effortlessly charming young gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dark smudges beneath his eyes betrayed the exhaustion he couldn&#39;t hide. Still, his gaze lit up the moment it landed on her. &#34;Lia, I&#39;m Sawyer. When you were little, you&#39;d always sneak off with me to the supermarket for candy...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he spoke, he pulled out something from behind his back as if by magic-a candy curved into two tiny rabbits locked in a tug-of-war over a carrot. The detail was so vivid it almost looked alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,you loved rabbits when you were little. This is for you,&#34; he said, his eyes bright with quiet anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t that child anymore, and sweets had long since lost their charm for her. Still, she valued his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Damon&#39;s excitement had nearly sent him tumbling from his wheelchair. Now, it was clear Sawyer&#39;s care for her ran just as deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought warmed her enough to accept the gift with a smile. &#34;Thank you, Sawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on, taste it,&#34; he said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a small nod, studying the delicate design in her hands, unsure where to even begin without ruining the artistry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl caught her hesitation and let out a chuckle. &#34;Lia,don&#39;t hold back. Sawyer learned how to make this just for you. Anytime you want one, he&#39;ll do it. If you don&#39;t believe me, check his room-it&#39;s practically overflowing with tools.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation stopped Eliana cold. She&#39;d assumed Sawyer had simply picked up the skill by chance,never imagining he&#39;d learned it with her in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was awful at it before, and you never liked what l made,&#34; Sawyer admitted, his smile warm and unhurried.&#34;But I&#39;ve gotten better. I just hope it&#39;s good enough now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened as her lips curved upward. There was even a faint shimmer in her eyes when she murmured, &#34;Thank you, Sawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pleasure,&#34; he replied earnestly. &#34;From now on,I&#39;ll make one for you every single day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright...&#34; she responded softly, nodding before taking a bite. The sugar melted on her tongue. Sweet enough to seep past her guard and into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Dad doing?&#34; Carl finally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze shifted toward Sawyer as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer let out a weary breath. &#34;It&#39;s a mess. Damon and I tried everything, but we couldn&#39;t even get close to him. They kept us in for questioning the whole day..We&#39;ll have to come up with another approach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl hesitated before saying, &#34;Tell me honestly,Sawyer-did Dad really do something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep crease formed between Sawyer&#39;s brows.course not. I know him. He would never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe that too,&#34; Carl admitted, &#34;but if nothing happened,why won&#39;t they let us see him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s being framed,&#34; Sawyer said without a flicker of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl fell quiet. He&#39;d always been wrapped up in his art,never bothering with business or politics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments like this only reminded him how useless that made him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands tangled in his hair. &#34;I&#39;m no help to anyone...completely useless.&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t say that,&#34; Sawyer replied, his tone softening as he turned to Eliana. &#34;Finding Lia was already a huge service to our family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s gaze dropped to the floor. &#34;That&#39;s only because everyone else was tied up with Dad&#39;s situation, and l happened to be the only one free...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew perfectly well that anyone in the Murray family, given access to the database, could have tracked Eliana down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His role had been more of a messenger than a real contributor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana reached over and gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. &#34;Carl, don&#39;t take this on yourself. You&#39;re not to blame for not being able to do more. None of us could have predicted this, but I believe Dad&#39;s going to be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if things ggot worse, she had no intention of letting harm come to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept into Carl&#39;s cheeks. Eliana had only just stepped into this world and should have been the one feeling unsettled-yet somehow, she was the one reassuring him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let it get to me, Lia,&#34; he said quickly Before Sawyer could add his own reassurance, the sharp trill of his phone cut through the moment. One glance at the caller ID made his brow tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another problem with the project? Alright, I get it. I&#39;ll head over right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Sawyer turned to them. &#34;Carl, Lia,let Mom know I need to step out for a bit. I won&#39;t be long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you off to? Did something go wrong with that project you put money into again?&#34; Carl asked,his voice tinged with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... but it&#39;s nothing major. Just don&#39;t mention it to Mom-I don&#39;t want her stressing over it,&#34; Sawyer said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached over to gently ruffle Eliana&#39;s hair. &#34;I&#39;m heading out now. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll make it up to you with something good to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Eliana replied with a small nod, her gaze following him as he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed behind him, Carl let out a long sigh. &#34;Sawyer&#39;s had a rough run too. He used to have the Midas touch with investments, but these last couple of years... one failure after another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped there, catching himself before he piled more worries onto Eliana&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl quickly shifted his tone. &#34;But this time, I&#39;m certain there&#39;s nothing to worry about. This project is a guaranteed win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah...&#34; Eliana murmured, giving a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s late. You&#39;ve been through a lot today. Go get some rest,&#34; Carl said with quiet warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; She nodded again and started for the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing Sawyer&#39;s room, she noticed the door standing slightly open and couldn&#39;t resist a quick glance inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight stopped her-rows of creations and tools neatly arranged, the room looking more like a candy art workshop than a bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought took shape in her mind, and she turned away, heading straight for her own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside,she pulled out her phone and dialed Seth.&#34;I need you to dig into why my brother Sawyer&#39;s investments have tanked over the past two years,&#34; she instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Seth replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s reputation, results came fast. Before long, Seth&#39;s voice was back on the line.confirmed it-someone&#39;s been sabotaging him from the shadows.&#34;</p>
