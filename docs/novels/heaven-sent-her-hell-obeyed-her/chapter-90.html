                <p>Eliana narrowed her eyes at Tristan. &#34;Why are you following me again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan arched a brow, lips curving with mischief. &#34;Take me with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Her refusal was sharp, merciless.&#34;You&#39;re too heavy. You&#39;ll just slow me down. Get off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression faltered, feigning hurt. &#34;Can&#39;t believe you&#39;re this heartless. I was just comforting you earlier,and now you&#39;re tossing me aside like some broken tool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elianna didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Get off,&#34; she repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Tristan shifted to climb down-then paused, as if remembering something. &#34;You sure you want to ditch me? My presence has its worth you know. You could use my pull.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hesitated, lips pressed into a thin line. After a brief pause, she gave in. &#34;Fine. Hold on tight.If you fall,it&#39;s not my problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s arms slid firm around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stiffened, her face darkening. She almost shoved him off on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you tell me to hold on tight?&#34; he said innocently,eyes gleaming with mischief. &#34;If | fall-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and hold still!&#34; she snapped. The throttle roared as she twisted it hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moped shot forward, tires screeching lightly against the asphalt. Eliana forced herself to ignore the weight of his arms cinched around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least he behaved-his hands stayed steady, not daring to roam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was for his own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he tried anything, she wouldn&#39;t care about his status-she&#39;d throw him off in a heartbeat. The moped weaved swiftly through traffic, cutting straight toward the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, curious onlookers rolled down their windows, jeering at Tristan for being a grown man letting a woman drive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tristan only sat there with the faintest curl of a smile on his lips-smug, arrogant, and so infuriating it made one&#39;s palms itch to smack him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Eliana was too focused on reaching the hospital to notice his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surgical floor, Leyla paced restlessly, heels clicking against the cold tile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t Davin&#39;s survival she worried about-quite the opposite. She prayed he would die quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he woke up and revealed she had refused to give his pill back, she would be facing jail term. If she had known he still had a chance of surviving, she would have waited until he was brain dead before calling for help. She had been careless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Murray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s son, daughter-in-law, and grandson had just rushed over. Believing Leyla had found Davin unconscious and called for help, they thanked her profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny Gordon, Davin&#39;s grandson, approached with a bottle of water. &#34;Miss Murray, you&#39;ve been waiting here with us for so long. Please sit down and have some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, but I don&#39;t needit.&#34; Leyla shook her head, feigning real concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she was certain Davin was dead, she couldn&#39;t relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her refusal only deepened Jonny&#39;s gratitude. &#34;You said earlier my grandpa took you as his student. If he knew how much you cared for him, he&#39;d be touched. But your health matters too-you shouldn&#39;t wear yourself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright... thank you.&#34; This time she accepted the water. Their fingers brushed lightly, a fleeting touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze. A strange coolness lingered on his fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he glanced up, he caught the shimmer of her watery eyes, the smoothness of her skin. His heart gave a sudden, unfamiliar thump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raised strictly by Davin, Jonny rarely interacted with women. Even the accidental brush of Leyla&#39;s fingers sent blood rushing to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla noticed, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Davin&#39;s fate still hanging in the balance-and knowing the Gordons, for all their wealth, were still beneath the Clarke family&#39;s standing-she brushed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought the bottle to her lips with practiced grace, taking a small sip. Afterwards, she resumed her pacing, unable to bring herself to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor in scrubs stepped out, mask hiding most of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes lit up. She rushed forward even faster than the Gordons.&#34;Doctor,how is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor said, &#34;We&#39;re doing our best to save him. But we need a family member to sign the surgical consent.Are you his family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s smile thinned. She shook her head and stepped back. Davin might actually survive? At his age,surviving this ordeal was nothing short of remarkable. Most people his age never made it past the operating table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, does he have a real chance of making it?&#34; Davin&#39;s son, Stan Gordon, asked anxiously after signing the consent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor hesitated. &#34;I&#39;m not the lead surgeon, so I can&#39;t say for certain. But you should prepare yourselves for any outcome. At his age, there&#39;s a strong possibility he won&#39;t pull through.&#34; Stan and his wife were visible shaken bythe news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla,however, felt her heart lift. Davin might not pull through? Great news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, doctor, do everything possible! Money is no issue,&#34; Stan pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll do our best,&#34; the doctor assured before turning back toward the OR.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a cool, cutting voice broke across the corridor.&#34;Leyla? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stiffened, eyes snapping towards the direction of the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the end of the corridor, aslender figure approached. She seized Leyla&#39;s wrist, eyes burning. &#34;I&#39;m talking to you! Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot through Leyla&#39;s arm, her composure cracking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared, startled at the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her long hair, disheveled by the wind, framed her striking face, lending her an edge both wild and captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s gut clenched with a surge of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed hard, masking it with a feigned calm.&#34;Let go of me-you&#39;re hurting me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eliana could answer, a firm hand closed around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know who she was, only that she was striking-and far too forceful. Her sharp tone and domineering grip left an immediate sour impression. &#34;Miss, whoever you are, let go of Miss Murray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gordon couple rushed forward. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expressionless, Eliana released Leyla&#39;s wrist but didn&#39;t break eye contact. Her gaze stayed locked on Leyla, cold and probing, as if stripping away the mask Leyla wore. Her instincts bristled. Davin himself had exposed Leyla for plagiarizing Carl&#39;s work-there was no way she was standing here out of genuine concern.Something else was at play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the Gordon family&#39;s interference stopped her from digging further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Eliana Murray,&#34; she said evenly, letting her eyes sweep over the family. &#34;Davin is my student.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed in silence,met with skeptical stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s jaw tightened. The way she had handed Leyla already created a bad impression on him.He couldn&#39;t trust anything she said.grandpa,your student? You&#39;ve got to be joking.&#34;</p>
