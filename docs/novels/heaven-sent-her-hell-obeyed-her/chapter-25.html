                <p>&#34;Ow-Boss,what the hell? Let go! What are you doing?&#34;Niko&#39;s voice broke in pain, his body twisting as he instinctively tried to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy didn&#39;t spare him a glance. He dragged Niko forward in long, unhurried strides until they stood directly in front of Eliana. Only then did he release his grip, letting Niko stumble and drop heavily to the ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Leroy stepped back several paces and bent at the waist in a deep, deliberate bow. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Hertha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name hit Niko like a thunderclap. Halfway to pushing himself upright, he froze solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every member of the Vulture Brotherhood knew that name by heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rule number one-never cross the Onyx Syndicate.Rule number two-never, under any circumstance,cross its leader, Hertha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy owed that woman his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this Murray girl really Hertha? Could this delicate woman be the same woman who commanded the Onyx Syndicate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization sank in like ice water down his spine. He had just insulted the one person Leroy would kill to protect. Niko&#39;s thoughts tangled,his face shifting from pale to ashen. He stayed exactly where he was, too rattled to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, on the other hand, was the picture of composure. A faint, knowing smile curved her lips as she met Leroy&#39;s gaze. &#34;It&#39;s been a long time, Leroy. I was starting to wonder if you&#39;d forgotten me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy shook his head quickly, almost offended by the thought. &#34;Even if I forgot my own name, I&#39;dnever have the nerve to forget you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking stride, he planted his boot firmly on Niko&#39;s stomach. &#34;This idiot dared to offend you. I&#39;ll drag him back and make sure he learns his place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Niko&#39;s eyes went wide with panic. &#34;Please-have mercy! Hertha, I&#39;m begging you, don&#39;t hold it against me. I swear, I didn&#39;t know who you were. If I had,I wouldn&#39;t have even breathed in your direction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitter taste of regret hit him hard. Only minutes ago, he&#39;d been barking at her to let him go-now it felt like he&#39;d aimed a gun at his own foot and pulled the trigger. Eliana lifted her hand, her tone calm but edged.&#34;Leave it. He didn&#39;t know any better. I&#39;ll act as though none of this happened-but if there&#39;s a next time,I won&#39;t need you to deal with him. I&#39;ll take care of it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have to waste your time on the likes of him,&#34; Leroy replied, his voice respectful but warm with gratitude. &#34;It would only sully your hands.&#34; He meant every word-after all, she had once saved his life and changed the course of it entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy gave Niko&#39;s leg a sharp kick. &#34;Move it-and thank her for letting you walk out of here alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still shaken, Niko dropped to his knees in front of Eliana without hesitation. &#34;Thank you! I&#39;ll never forget this mercy. I was an idiot before. If you ever need anything-anything at all-just say the word and I&#39;ll make it happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana arched a brow, silently acknowledging his apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, Niko hadn&#39;t done anything that seriously harmed her or her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy caught the look and gave a dismissive wave,signaling for Niko to get out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were alone, he stepped in closer, lowering his voice. &#34;Hertha, what&#39;s the story here? How did you end up as a Murray? Did my people get the wrong information,or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No mistake,&#34; Eliana replied evenly. &#34;I&#39;ve reunited with my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed in surprise. &#34;Reunited? You&#39;re telling me you&#39;re actually Louis and Stella&#39;s daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The single word was all Leroy needed. He&#39;d always known she had family somewhere, but the idea of her actually reuniting with them had never crossed his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why she&#39;d chosen this moment,he didn&#39;t dare pry into.Instead, he inclined his head. &#34;Ifthe Murrays are your blood, then this estate stays with them. Keep that contract close-no one will ever try to take it from them again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana accepted the document without hesitation.&#34;I&#39;lL have Seth wire the amount you paid for the property back to your account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy&#39;s head shook instantly. &#34;No. I won&#39;t take a penny from you. You saved my life-without you, I&#39;d have died hungry in some back alley of Eighvale. Let this be my way of saying thanks.&#34; Gratitude&#39;s a rare thing these days,&#34; Eliana replied,her voice cool. &#34;Unlike certain people who stay ungrateful no matter how much care they received.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was referring to Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hint of approval in Eliana&#39;s tone lit up Leroy&#39;s face with pride. &#34;Will you be here for a while, or heading back to Eighvale soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving,&#34; she said evenly. &#34;The Onyx Syndicate is moving here with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy&#39;s face lit up like he&#39;d just been handed a winning ticket. Working under her wasn&#39;t something he&#39;d ever thought possible-the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s standards were sky-high, and he&#39;d never quite made the cut. But now? Now he had his own crew and a direct connection to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the best news I&#39;ve heard all year. From this day on, the Vulture Brotherhood is at your command.I know every corner of this city-whatever you need,just tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana considered him for a beat before speaking.&#34;Then you can start by handling something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Name it,&#34; he said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mother swears this estate was never put up as collateral.I want to know who did it behind our backs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy&#39;s mouth curved into a confident grin. &#34;Piece of cake. I&#39;ll have the answer to you by tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be expecting it,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They traded contact information before she motioned toward the gates. &#34;Go on. I should get back and tell them everything&#39;s fine before they start worrying.Take your men and clear out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; With her permission given, Leroy didn&#39;t waste a second. In moments, his buddies had piled into their vehicles and disappeared down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana turned on her heel and made her way back toward the main house, the contract tucked safely in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hadn&#39;t even reached the living room when she caught sight of Stella descending the staircase, her voice calling out for an update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean stepped forward before anyone else could speak.&#34;Mom,what are you doing out of bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came down because I was worried about Eliana...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single sentence tugged at something warm inside Eliana, and she almost stepped forward-until Sean&#39;s next words soured the air. &#34;Worried about her? You  should be worrying about the rest of us. Those men here for the estate? That&#39;s all because of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression hardened instantly. Sean had always been quick to act, slow to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice cut through, sharp with disapproval. &#34;Sean,stop talking nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense?&#34; Sean scoffed. &#34;Mom, you clearly don&#39;t know the whole story. Eliana went straight to meet the Clarkes earlier. Heard they had some famed doctor, then pretended to be one herself. Tied to treat Miguel and made him cough up blood instead.I told her to apologize, but she refused. And wouldn&#39;t you know it-right after we got back, people showed up to take our estate. If that&#39;s not the Clarkes taking revenge, what else could it be? You&#39;re defending her while she&#39;s putting our home on the chopping block.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stayed quiet, her gaze fixed on Stella, watching closely for the woman&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Respect and trust were a two-way street. If Stella was as quick to turn on her as Sean was, then Eliana knew she&#39;d have little reason to keep calling this place home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Stella strode straight up to Sean and brought her hand across his face. The sharp crack rang through the living room like a whip. Eliana froze where she stood, caught off guard by the sudden blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s eyes widened. He clutched his cheek, staring at Stella in disbelief. &#34;Mom, what was that for? If anyone deserves a slap, it&#39;s Eliana-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of his sentence was cut short by a second,harder strike, the sound even louder than thefirst.</p>
