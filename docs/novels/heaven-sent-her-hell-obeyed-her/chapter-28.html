                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry... Mom... I really messed up.&#34; This time,Sean&#39;s admission came from more than just a bruised ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His bolunder wasn&#39;t just about trusting Leyla too much;it was also born from that stubborn streak of his, the need to be right even if it meant pushing others into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Sean decided on something, he wanted everyone around him to accept it without debate.Many had called him argumentative, and they weren&#39;t wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla had never challenged him, which only drew him closer to her over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, standing here in front of his mother, he was starting to wonder if that blind agreement had done him more harm than good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the past, your recklessness might have been excused! Your father and I could shield you back then.But times have changed. You can&#39;t keep going on like this-your attitude has to change!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his head bowed, Sean muttered, &#34;You&#39;re right...&#34;Stella&#39;s breath came sharp before she continued,her tone laced with disappointment. &#34;Your two older brothers are still out there running themselves ragged for your father, hardly getting a bite to eat. And you?You nearly jeopardized the entire family with your impulsive choices!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt hit him hard enough to make him wish he could land a punch on himself. &#34;I was wrong, Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than answer him, Stella reached for Eliana&#39;s hand instead. &#34;Eliana, you&#39;ve had a rough day. You went to the Clarke family all by yourself and even managed to lessen the threat against us, and yet Sean turned against you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a small shake of her head and replied,-&#34;It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t feel wronged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m angry for you! You are his sister, his blood. Instead,he clings to someone who abandons all of the second trouble comes knocking! It makes my blood boil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s agitation grew with each word, her breathing turning uneven until Eliana hurried to steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,please calm down. Your health comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s nerves frayed as panic set in. &#34;Please, Mom,you can hit me, yell at me, anything you want-just don&#39;t work yourself up like this. I swear I&#39;ve learned my lesson. I should never have spoken without knowing the facts. You have my word that I wvill never do it again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella steadied her breathing, though her reddened eyes betrayed the storm still swirling inside her.&#34;Sean,I just want you to start thinking before you act, and stop clinging so tightly to your own opinions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame etched itself into Sean&#39;s features. &#34;Everyting that happened was my fault. From now on, I&#39;ll do whatever you tell me to. And, Lia, I owe you an apology. If you&#39;re angry, you can hit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s posture tensed for a moment. &#34;There&#39;s no need for that...&#34; she replied evenly. Violence had never appealed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Sean could avoid repeating the foolishness of today,she would consider that enough of an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long sigh slipped from Stella as she said, &#34;Our family has problems,but none that can&#39;t be solved. What we can&#39;t afford is to turn on each other-because that&#39;s when our enemies will find a way in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bowing his head, Sean said, &#34;Mom, I&#39;m terribly sorry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to your room and think about your actions. This time, I expect you to mean it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mom.&#34; Sean&#39;s nod was firm, though his mind churned with realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little, he realized Leyla might not be the person he had imagined, and she wasn&#39;t nearly as untrustworthy as he once thought. It was time to reflect for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Stella&#39;s medicine had been prepared, and with Ashley&#39;s assistance, she made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl came through the door not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Eliana sitting alone in the living room,he tilted his head. &#34;Lia, where is everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of them went to their rooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl nodded, his eyes brightening. &#34;You&#39;re incredible.I&#39;ve never seen the Clarkes treat us with so much respect before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The admiration in his gaze was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had long since learned to take his doting in stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Carl could speak again, she said, &#34;I need your help with something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Name it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a few friends looking for a large space to work in-somewhere quiet would be perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl thought for a beat before answering, &#34;There&#39;s an old factory on the west side. We once planned to make it a tourist spot, but the road access is so bad it&#39;s been sitting empty ever since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could my friends use it for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; he replied instantly, not a flicker of doubt in his tone. Meeting Lia&#39;s needs felt like meeting his own, and her happiness was the only return he wanted. That patch of land meant nothing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me two days, and I&#39;ll transfer the property to your name. You can lease it to your friends and keep the rent money for yourself,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer brought a quiet thrill to Eliana. She could have rented somewhere on her own, but securing such a big space out of the blue would only invite questions. The Onyx Syndicate still needed to keep their heads down until the handover was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Murray name attached to the property,no one would think twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a member of the Murray family had its perks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Carl,&#34; she said sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pleasure. You must be exhausted after that visit to the Clarkes. I&#39;ve already run a hot bath for you-it should still be ready. Go take a good bath and relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Head upstairs, take a bath, and rest for a while. I&#39;ll call you down when dinner&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; She gave a small nod before heading up the stairs and slipping into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space was a vision in pink, untouched since the day Eliana was separated from her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Leyla was adopted, she&#39;d been given another room entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That decision had spoken volumes-the Murrays had never truly let Eliana go. They had kept this place waiting, as though she might walk back through the door at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch was spotless, Ashley&#39;s handiwork shining in the polished surfaces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s fingertips trailed over each familiar piece of furniture, and with every touch came a subtle wave of comfort that eased the hollow ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the bathroom,warm steam curled up from the tub Carl had promised to prepare, rose petals floating lazily on the surface. Easing herself into the fragrant water, Eliana let out a slow, contented breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her moment of peace broke when the phone began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth&#39;s name flashed across the screen. &#34;Boss,remember how you asked me to check into the Pearson family? I think I&#39;ve found something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are two sons in the family-Jermaine and Tristan. Everyone thinks Tristan&#39;s the illegitimate one,but here&#39;s the twist. Take a guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop making me wait. Spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan is actually the legitimate heir. His father&#39;s mistress swapped him at birth with her own son,Jermaine.The truth only came out last month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana raised her eyebrows and replied, &#34;That explains why the Pearsons suddenly named a new heir around then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jermaine&#39;s been shipped overseas, and Tristan&#39;s taken the reins. On top of that, he&#39;s proven sharp and has already reshaped the Pearson Group headquarters in Eighvale within a month.&#34; Eliana&#39;s thoughts drifted to the man she had crossed paths with earlier that day. &#34;Send me a photo of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. Sending now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments her phone buzzed with Seth&#39;s photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in the photo, the man&#39;s striking features and commanding presence were impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,it really is him...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Eliana said. &#34;Get me his address. I need to meet him.&#34;</p>
