                <p>The image was as unclear as Rocco had warned, yet one glance was enough for Tristan to feel a sharp tug of recognition-something in the woman&#39;s profile echoed Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance was uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Eliana was the same woman from that night, the one he had been hunting all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, the woman who had helped him had also been drugged with an aphrodisiac, leadding to that night in the hot spring where they had crossed an irreversible line together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana was a master of medicine. Could someone with that level of expertise really have been taken down by such a crude trick? Anyone capable of extending another&#39;s life should have been able to neutralize an aphrodisiac without effort. The pieces refused to fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was just a coincidence.Maybe the similarity was nothing more than a cruel trick of memory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers drumming lightly against the edge of an iPad,Tristan finally lifted his gaze to Rocco. &#34;Can you clean up this image? I need it in high definition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible, but it won&#39;t be quick,&#34; Rocco answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long?&#34; Tristan asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Given how bad the quality is, I&#39;d say three days-minimum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three days is fine.&#34; Tristan&#39;s tone was calm,decisive. After waiting an entire year, a few more days barely mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get the restoration started immediately,&#34; Rocco replied without hesitation. Tristan gave a brief nod. &#34;And the bad news you mentioned earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reminder jogged Rocco&#39;s memory, and his expression shifted. &#34;The rumor&#39;s true,&#34; he said grimly. &#34;The Murray family has reached out to your father about your so-called engagement to their daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of distaste crossed Tristan&#39;s features in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the Murray name still carried weight, they&#39;d stayed silent about this arrangement. Now, with their influence crumbling, they suddenly wanted to cash in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, it was obvious-they were trying to trade their daughter for a shot at reclaiming their status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can try to use her to regain their status,&#34;Tristan said with a thin, cold smile, &#34;but I&#39;m not buying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father called me earlier,&#34; Rocco continued. &#34;He believes that, despite their current downfall, the Murrays are respectable and wants you to at least think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;Get in touch with the Murrays and tell them I&#39;ll be there tomorrow afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco blinked. &#34;You&#39;re... actually considering marrying her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even close,&#34; Tristan replied, lowering the car window so the evening air could spill in. &#34;I&#39;m going to end it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his first move into Qidence now secured, it felt like the right moment to start reshaping the branch office-and that meant cutting off loose ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the branch&#39;s employees had once served under Jermaine, which meant resistance was almost guaranteed. A clash was inevitable, and Tristan knew it. A taxi pulled up outside the Murrays&#39; residence, and Eliana stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl had been pacing near the entrance, his expression brightening the moment he spotted her.&#34;You&#39;re finally back! Where did you disappear to?And why didn&#39;t you pick up any clothes for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been under the impression she had gone shopping to replace her wardrobe, and the sight before him didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Eliana glance down at herself, realizing she was still dressed in the shapeless, ill-fitting clothes of that middle-aged human trafficker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d swapped into them earlier to avoid attracting attention from villagers while the fire was being put out, and somehow, she&#39;d never changed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder strangers had been staring at her as if she were a beggar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small shrug, she slipped off the coat and tossed it straight into the trash bin. &#34;It slipped my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect timing. Mom had a boutique send over a batch of outfits-come pick out something you like,&#34;Carl said, guiding Eliana toward the living room,which now looked more like a private showroom than a family space. Elegant dresses and finely tailored pieces lined the racks, giving the place the feel of an exclusive shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the Murray family&#39;s finances under strain,they had spared no expense to prepare this for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought softened something in Eliana&#39;s guarded heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers brushed over a long dress hanging at the center of the rack, and she took it upstairs to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a simple cut, patterned with white camellias that seemed almost alive against the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dressed, she gathered her hair into a loose bun and splashed her face with cool water before stepping out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl was already outside, and the moment his eyes landed on her, he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plain dress somehow made her look even more striking, skimming over her frame and highlighting the graceful lines of her figure. Her hair, no longer spilling over her shoulders, bared the elegant curve of her neck. And her face-delicate and perfectly balanced-looked like it had stepped out of an artist&#39;s canvas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl had always known Eliana was beautiful, but right now, she left him momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to Leyla, Eliana looked as though she&#39;d stepped straight out of a storybook-too flawless to seem real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, you are gorgeous!&#34; Carl blurted, unable to hide his amazement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caring about her appearance had never been one of Eliana&#39;s priorities; if it had, she wouldn&#39;t have spent  days barefaced without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering him a small, polite smile, she asked, &#34;Is Mom awake yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is. While you were changing, Ashley brought her a bowl of porridge. She actually ate some-seems like her appetite&#39;s coming back,&#34; Carl said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a quiet nod, then handed him the bundle of Goosegrass she&#39;d brought home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what I went out to get for her,&#34; she explained.&#34;Add it to the pot with the medicine I started earlier and let it simmer for thirty minutes before giving it to her. I&#39;m going to check on her now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s brows lifted. &#34;So you went out just to buy a herb for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; she answered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion welled in Carl&#39;s eyes, and genuine gratitude warmed his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get the medicine right away,&#34; he said firmly.  When it came to Eliana&#39;s skills, he never doubted her for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Eliana&#39;s last treatment, their mother had claimed to feel lighter and more at ease, and that alone had cemented Carl&#39;s faith in her abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl carried the Goosegrass toward the kitchen while Eliana made her way to Stella&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even raised her hand to knock when the door swung open, and Ashley Castro, the housekeeper, stepped into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the Murray famnily&#39;s decline, most of the staff had been dismissed-only Ashley and her husband,Jordy,had stayed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashley greeted Eliana warmly, her eyes soft with a familiar fondness born from years past, when she had cared for Eliana as a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the memories weren&#39;t there, Eliana could see the sincerity in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be Ashley,&#34; Eliana said with a polite smile. &#34;Thank you for everything you&#39;ve been doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moisture glimmered in Ashley&#39;s eyes. &#34;You don&#39;t need to thank me. This is simply what I owe. If the Murray family hadn&#39;t stepped in back then, my boy wouldn&#39;t be alive today... so no matter what comes,Jordy and I aren&#39;t going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordy-her husband-had clearly made the same VOW.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Eliana understood why they alone had chosen to remain when everyone else was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful for their unwavering loyalty, she silently promised herself they would never regret their decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to check on my mom,&#34; Eliana said,her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. She was just asking for you,&#34; Ashley replied quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Eliana stepped past her and into the room. Her earlier research had revealed that Stella came from the distinguished Buckley family of Eighvale-a celebrated beauty in her youth and someone her relatives had once pinned high hopes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of following the path they had chosen for her, Stella had married Louis, who at the time was nothing more than a modest civil servant. The decision had cost her dearly. On the day of her wedding, her family had cut her off entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana walked in, Stella was just setting down the phone. Warmth lit her eyes as she looked over.&#34;Welcome home, Lia. That dress looks beautiful on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For as long as she could remember, Stella had wanted to dress Eliana like a princess, though those blissful years had been cut short, barely lasting three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hopeful spark in her eyes, she asked, &#34;Do you like the clothes I picked out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| do,&#34; Eliana replied with a small nod. &#34;This is only the beginning. More will arrive soon,&#34;Stella said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never be able to wear them all...&#34; Eliana answered, her voice carrying a hint of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let them wait in the closet. A young woman should always have more choices than she needs,&#34;Stella replied gently, taking Eliana&#39;s hand and studying her face as if she wanted to memorize every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting under the weight of that gaze, Eliana steered the conversation elsewhere. &#34;How have you been feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than before,&#34; Stella answered warmly. &#34;I have more energy now, and my thoughts aren&#39;t so foggy anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve learned medicine,&#34; Eliana remarked softly.&#34;I&#39;ll help you recover step by step until you&#39;re completely well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella nodded, though it wasn&#39;t Eliana&#39;s medical skill that moved her-it was the fact she cared enough to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patting the space beside her, Stella gestured for Eliana to sit. &#34;Lia, there&#39;s something important I need to tell you.&#34;</p>
