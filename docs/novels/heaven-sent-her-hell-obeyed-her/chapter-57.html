                <p>Leyla couldn&#39;t wait any longer. She had to see Hector. With so many women admiring him, a few days apar felt dangerous. What if his feelings shifted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting time, she found Davin&#39;s number, cleared her throat, and dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected swiftly, and a low, weathered voice came through, &#34;Hello, who is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, this is Leyla Murray,&#34; She introduced herself quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin might not have saved her number, but he remembered her.&#34;Oh,I remember you-the young lady who won the oil painting competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla blinked in mild surprise.&#34;Yes, that&#39;s me. You still remnember me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Your piece was very creative, blending elements from different countries into one canvas. I still recall it clearly.So,what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla got straight to the point, asking if he could get her an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin said. &#34;I&#39;d planned to take two students with me, but they&#39;re heading abroad for an exhibition.Since you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll give you the extra invitations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face lit up. &#34;I really appreciate it! I can come to your place right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll text you my address and wait for you. By the way, there&#39;s a competition at this éxhibition. It&#39;d be great if you could take part,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s smile faltered. Original works had never been her strength-her imagination just wasn&#39;t enough. But she knew if she refused, Davin might not hand over the invitations at all. So she swallowed her reluctance and agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of heading to Davin&#39;s immediately, Leyla made a detour to the Murray estate. Luckily, Eliana wasn&#39;t home to meddle-only Damon and Carl were there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had gone with Sawyer to thank Miguel in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Clarkes had been gracious with gifts at the banquet, and Stella wanted to show that her family was wvilling to let the past rest. She&#39;d even brought gifts with her today. In their world, more friends were always better than more enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla keyed in the familiar code and strode into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl was making coffee for Damon. The moment his eyes landed on her, his expression soured.&#34;What are you doing here again? We made it clear a few days ago-this place isn&#39;t yours anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s gaze swept over the two of them. &#34;Relax, I&#39;m not here to claim the place. I&#39;m here to take what&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl snorted, &#34;And what here belongs to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My room still has plenty of my clothes. Autumn&#39;s coming-I need them,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your clothes? Those were bought with our family fortune! I&#39;d rather burn them than let you take them,&#34; Carl snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face hardened. &#34;I don&#39;t have time to argue. Those clothes were bought with money I earned over the years. You have no right to touch them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Carl started forward, furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Damon&#39;s voice cut in from his wheelchair. &#34;Let her take them. I don&#39;t want any of her stupid things left in this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Damon had been kind to her. But ever since Eliana arrived, even he had changed. His indifference now only confirmed what she already suspected-she&#39;d been nothing but a stand-in for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it mattered anymore. She&#39;d never wanted their affection. She turned to Carl. &#34;You heard him. He agrees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then take your things and go,&#34; Damon said flatly. &#34;Don&#39;t show up here again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice was equally cold. &#34;Did you hear him? Take your stuff and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla shot them both a cutting glare. Fools-short-sighted and snobbish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she married Hector, she&#39;d make sure they regretted every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t waste time arguing. She went upstairs-not to her own room, but to Carl&#39;s. The walls were lined with his paintings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t take any, but she took pictures of each one before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she headed to her own room, packed a few clothes, and dragged her suitcase downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl blocked her way, glancing at it suspiciously. &#34;Everything in there yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla popped it open. Inside were only her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See for yourself. Want me to pull each piece out for inspection?&#34; she said, chin tilted high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s brow furrowed. He had the nagging sense she was up to something, but the suitcase checked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, he stepped aside. &#34;Take it-and get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla shut the suitcase, walked a few steps, then looked back.&#34;You might feel smug now, but when your money runs dry, you&#39;ll come crawling to me. And when that day comes, you&#39;ll cry and apologize for what you said today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl scoffed. &#34;We&#39;d rather starve than beg you. And you&#39;d better hold on to Hector. He might decide to leave you one day, and then you&#39;ll be the one left crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for your concern. Hector and I are doing just fine. When we marry, I&#39;ll send you an invitation,&#34; she sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;Don&#39;t bother. None of us will attend.&#34; Leyla&#39;s face darkened. That stung more than Carl&#39;s barbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then an idea came to her. Her lips curved slightly.&#34;1got Brenda&#39;s engagement invitation yestero:d yoi get yours,Damon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s expression froze, and the color drained from his face, leaving him pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s satisfaction bloomed. Knowing Damon so well, she knew Brenda&#39;s engagement would hit him hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you didn&#39;t, I can give you mine,&#34; she said sweetly. &#34;Even if you can&#39;t be with her, seeing her happy should make you happy too,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s chest tightened painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could answer, Carl snatched up a feather duster and swung it at her.&#34;You wretched woman,get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow landed on her arm, leaving an angry red mark on her skin. Her eyes blazed. &#34;How dare you hit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Now get out!&#34; Carl barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised the duster again, but Leyla, having made her point, decided she&#39;d had enough. She spun on her heel and stormed out, suitcase wheels rattling behind her.</p>
