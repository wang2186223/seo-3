                <p>Neal hadn&#39;t foreseen his hired muscle turning on him -much less bowing to Eliana as if she were the one pulling their strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first instinct was to bolt, but the cold, unyielding wall at his back killed that thought instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trapped with no way out, he felt like prey caught in a cage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from his face. &#34;No... no,no! I paid you! You can&#39;t turn on melike this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step the men took toward him made his pulse slam harder. &#34;How much did she give you? I&#39;ll double it-no,triple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These weren&#39;t the kind of men you bargained with for mercy, and Neal knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they got their hands on him, it wouldn&#39;t just ruin his future-it would erase it entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words tumbled out in desperation. &#34;If triple&#39;s not enough, just say the number! You know the Clarke family in Qidence? I&#39;m about to marry their daughter.  Whatever you want, I can get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of the Clarke name, Eliana&#39;s brows drew together, surprise flickering in her eyes. She hadn&#39;t expected that connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Niko&#39;s lip curled into a cold smirk. &#34;This isn&#39;t about the cash.Boys-make sure he remembers this day every time he breathes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; A chorus of agreement rang out from Niko&#39;s four men before they lunged at Neal, fists and boots landing with merciless precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They struck where it hurt the most, each blow calculated to send shockwaves of pain through his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh! Somebody help me!&#34; Neal&#39;s screams tore from his throat, his mind burning with hatred for Eliana.Why hadn&#39;t that fire taken her? Life would be so much easier if she&#39;d just stayed dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought barely left his mind before the rhythm of approaching footsteps cut through the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Who&#39;s there? Stop right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise had drawn a handful of bystanders, their faces tense as they took in the scene</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them fumbled for a phone, speaking fast &#34;Police? Yeah, we&#39;ve got a street fight-send someone quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the police call registered, Niko&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;Hertha, what&#39;s the move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That split second of uncertainty was all Neal needed.He bolted for the mouth of the alley,legs pumping in desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s fingers twitched, and a gleam of silver cut through the air, landing with surgical precision in the small of his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh-&#34; Neal&#39;s cry split the air as pain shot through him. He ripped the needle free and staggered onward,still determined to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint,knowing smile played at Eliana&#39;s lips as she watched him disappear down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Niko and his crew took a step forward, ready to run him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him go.&#34; Eliana&#39;s voice cut through, calm and certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he hasn&#39;t gotten what&#39;s coming to him yet!&#34; Niko exclaimed,his frustration flaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wounds they&#39;d given Neal were hardly enough for satisfaction. &#34;He has,&#34; Eliana replied, her tone carrying an edge of quiet assurance. &#34;He just doesn&#39;t know it yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strike she&#39;d delivered would leave Neal cursing every step he took for days. With her goal met, there was no reason to waste energy on pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice stayed even as she said, &#34;The police are already on their way. You don&#39;t want them asking questions about who you are-get moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Niko wavered. &#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts. Go,&#34; Eliana interjected, her tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctance flickered across his face, but he gave a sharp nod and motioned for his men to clear out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden buzz from her phone drew her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s name lit the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she answered, his voice came warm and casual.&#34;Lia, where are you? I&#39;ve got a bag picked out for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed some air,&#34; Eliana replied smoothly. &#34;Meet me at Entrance One.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. I&#39;ll be right there,&#34; Carl said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call and started toward the mouth of  the alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police station wasn&#39;t far, and sirens hadn&#39;t taken long to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped into the open, two uniformed officers intercepted her. &#34;Were y/ou involved in the fight here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t even have the chance to open her mouth before a couple of bystanders jumped in. &#34;That&#39;s her!We saw her telling those guys to beat up some man...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers&#39; eyes hardened. &#34;Ma&#39;am, we&#39;ll need to see your identification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet curse formed in her head-her driver&#39;s license was in her old bag, the one Janessa had stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not on me,&#34; she said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you&#39;ll have to come with us,&#34; one officer stated,leaving no room for debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line, ready to argue,when the low purr of an engine slid up beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek luxury car stopped, its tinted window gliding down to reveal a face carved in perfect lines. It was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what exactly are you doing here?&#34; His gaze  flicked over the scene, curiosity sparking in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all the people to run into now, Eliana thought bitterly, it had to be him-someone with ties to her that were already too tangled for comfort, and at the worst possible moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing important,&#34; she answered coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered in the officers&#39; eyes. &#34;Mr.Pearson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan offered a faint nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d shared a dinner with the police chief,only a few days ago, and apparently, the chief had made sure his men knew exactly who Tristan was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the officers&#39; gazes drifted between them before he asked, &#34;Is she with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of amusement lit Tristan&#39;s eyes as he turned to Eliana. &#34;Would you say we&#39;re friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line. He was toying with her-she could hear it in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a trip to the police station was the last thing she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clear reluctance, she gave a short nod. &#34;Yes.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not so sure,&#34; Tristan replied, his expression impossible to read. &#34;I don&#39;t even know your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow creased.What game was he playing now?Was he really going to stand there and let her fend for herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana drew in a slow breath, ready to answer, when one of the officers cut her off, saying, &#34;If she&#39;s not with you, sir, we&#39;ll be taking her in for questioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved as if to guide Eliana toward the police car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could, Tristan&#39;s voice slid in, calm but edged with intent. &#34;We may not be friends yet, but I&#39;d like the chance. How about letting her go-as a favor to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward chuckle passed between the two officers,followed by eager nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. We&#39;re happy to oblige,&#34; one of them said quickly. &#34;You&#39;re free to go, miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the supposed victim long gone, there was no reason for the officers to push the matter-especially not when Tristan&#39;s position in it was already clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They returned to their vehicle, the engine humming to life before the police car rolled away. The small crowd, now bored without any drama to watch, drifted off in different directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana&#39;s eyes met Tristan&#39;s, there was something in his gaze she couldn&#39;t quite name. It felt almost as though he wasn&#39;t seeing her at all, but a ghost from his past standing in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was the case, it wasn&#39;t her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for stepping in. And for what you did earlier,&#34;Eliana said,her tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s mouth curved in the faintest of smiles.&#34;Spoken gratitude doesn&#39;t do much for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana let a few seconds pass before asking, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say someone in your family was ill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a short nod. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make time to see them,&#34; she suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched his lips. &#34;Interesting. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s quite hard to enlist your help. Seems I&#39;m an exception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I settle what I owe,&#34; she replied evenly. &#34;Consider it repayment for the two favors you did me today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, I&#39;ll accept. How&#39;s tomorrow?&#34; Tristan asked. Eliana shook her head. &#34;I can&#39;t get to Eighvale in the next couple of days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her return to the Murray family still fresh, she wasn&#39;t about to give them a reason to start speculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then at least hear the details first,&#34; Tristan said. &#34;If it&#39;s not something you can handle, you&#39;ll know before you make the trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she answered with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten o&#39;clock tomorrow. Pearson Group&#39;s branch office,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window slid up, and the sleek car drifted back into traffic until it disappeared from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the driver&#39;s seat, Rocco caught the slight curve of Tristan&#39;s mouth in the rearview mirror-a rare sign of good spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It startled him. In all his time behind the wheel, he&#39;d never seen Tristan look quite like that. It wasn&#39;t just a good mood-it was anticipation, and it was aimed directly at tomorrow&#39;s meeting.</p>
