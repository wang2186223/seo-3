                <p>Sean stayed rooted to the spot, his bewildered eyes fixed on Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze cut into him like ice. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go on?Ask me again why I slapped you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s chin dipped, shoulders stiff. &#34;You&#39;re my mother.If you want to hit me or scold me, I&#39;ve got no right to complain. I&#39;ll take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Eliana&#39;s brow arched ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, she conceded that perhaps Sean wasn&#39;t completely hopeless-at least he still showed respect to his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s voice lost a shade of its heat. &#34;I hit you because Lia is your sister, yet you speak of her like she&#39;s a stranger-or worse, an enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;You&#39;re right. I shouldn&#39;t have been so harsh. But what I said wasn&#39;t a lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes narrowed, her tone turning deliberate &#34;Did you see it happen with your own eyes? Were you standing there when she pretended to be some doctor and treated Miguel, only for him to cough up blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s lips parted, but no words came right away. He remembered slipping out when he was supposed to be reflecting on his behavior. And he hadn&#39;t actually seen any of it for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an awkward cough, he finally muttered, &#34;l..didn&#39;t witness it, but Leyla told me directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift in Stella&#39;s face was immediate. &#34;Leyla is the one who filled your head with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You know how close she is to Hector. She was walking out of the Clarkes&#39; residence when she told me, so I figured she wouldn&#39;t lie about it,&#34; Sean insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression stayed icy. &#34;Which means you&#39;ve been repeating accusations you never saw with your own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That jab left Sean standing there, tongue-tied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing her eyes, Stella drew in a long, steady breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spoke again, her voice carried the weight of a lesson. &#34;Then I was right to slap some sense into you. Words about things you haven&#39;t seen may not be the truth. And even when you do see something, it  doesn&#39;t mean you understand it. I&#39;ve told you countless times to think before you open your mouth.All those hours you&#39;ve spent throwing punches..maybe it&#39;s time you learned to sit still and read a book.As of today, you&#39;re done with the Fist Guild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s voice rose in alarm.&#34;Mom...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Stella could respond, Eliana walked into the living room.&#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Stella&#39;s eyes landed on her,the hard edge in her face melted away. She nearly stepped forward on impulse, ready to ask if anyone had dared mistreat her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana gave a small shake of her head. &#34;No. I&#39;ve already taken care of it. They won&#39;t be coming back to stake a claim on our home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Stella off guard. &#34;You managed that...on your own?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Eliana&#39;s tone was matter-of-fact as she added,&#34;They happen to answer to a friend of mine. Once my friend stepped in, the problem vanished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean leaned in from the side, suspicion sharp in his voice. &#34;A friend? You&#39;ve barely set foot in Qidence.Who exactly are these friends-and don&#39;t tell me they&#39;re the shady kind.&#34; Stella&#39;s sharp glare cut Sean off mid-breath, the unspoken warning enough to shut him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting her focus, she addressed Eliana, saying,&#34;Did you ask your friend whether this estate really went into foreclosure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t completely certain yet,&#34; Eliana answered evenly. &#34;But he promised to dig into it and give me a clear answer by tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s expression said it all-he didn&#39;t believe a word.In his mind, there was nothing to investigate. This was clearly Eliana smoothing things over with the Clarkes after provoking them earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a slow nod. &#34;The moment you hear back,I want to know. And if your friend truly went out ofhis way to help us, we&#39;ll thank him properly-with dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; Eliana replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could say more, the video doorbell chimed. A man&#39;s voice, slightly winded and middle-aged, came through the speaker. &#34;Hello? Anyone home?&#34; I&#39;m sent by Mr. Jeffry Clarke to deliver a few things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words came through the speaker,Sean practically jumped. &#34;Mom! See? The man works for the Clarke family! Didn&#39;t I tell you Leyla wouldn&#39;t  lie? Eliana&#39;s the one who stirred them up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s gaze shifted to Carl, a subtle signal for him to answer the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sean slid in front of him, arms spread like a barricade. &#34;Don&#39;t! First they came for the estate-now who knows what else they&#39;re after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move aside, Sean.&#34; Stella&#39;s voice was firm enough to cut glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grudgingly, he stepped back, though his glare never left Eliana. Every glance he threw her way dripped with accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t bother acknowledging him. Her voice was calm, almost too calm, as she said to Stella, &#34;Mom,you have to believe me. I never tricked or hurt anyone.I went to the Clarkes&#39; estate because someone needed treatment-nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean jumped on the words like a wolf on prey.&#34;Ha!Hear that? She admits it-she really did go there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella winced, her patience thinning under the weight of his raised voice. She pressed her hands over her ears,trying to dull the sting of Sean&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll hear the truth when the representative steps inside. Until then, hold your tongue,&#34; she said, her voice firm enough to clip the air. Sean bit down on his reply, lips pressed into a tight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl used the pause to slip toward the door, while Stella&#39;s fingers closed warmly around Eliana&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Eliana spoke the truth or not, Stella had already made her choice-she would shield her daughter, even if it meant defending her through a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, Eliana&#39;s eyes softened, a quiet reassurance passing between them without a word spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confidence was unshaken. The visitor wasn&#39;t here to stir up trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Sean&#39;s gaze flicked to their joined hands, a knot tightening in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of him longed for Stella to finally see what he and Leyla had been warning about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,beneath the bitterness, there lingered a reluctant wish-that the Clarkes had come for reasons that wouldn&#39;t harm his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood was blood, and some instincts ran deeper than pride. The seconds dragged,heavy and slow,until the sound of footsteps broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From their weight and rhythm, it was clear more than one visitor had crossed the threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rhythm of footsteps told a clear story-several people were approaching, not just one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Stella felt a flicker of unease now. She could face trouble without flinching, but the thought of failing to shield Eliana gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Murray...&#34; A voice cut through the air, drawing every pair of eyes in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl reappeared from the doorway, leading in the man they&#39;d seen on the video doorbell. He was middle-aged,polished, and trailed by four suited bodyguards,each balancing ornate gift boxes in their arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s brows lifted in surprise as her gaze met the newcomer&#39;s. &#34;Hello... and these are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man gave a respectful bow, his tone smooth and practiced. &#34;I&#39;m Mr. Jeffry Clarke&#39;s personal assistant.He sent me to deliver these gifts as a token of gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, the pieces clicked for Stella. She had already seen proof of Eliana&#39;s skill with her own eyes -this only confirmed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to respond when Sean&#39;s voice cut in like a jagged edge, saying, &#34;Gifts? What gifts? Last I heard,Miguel was coughing up blood after she treated him. So why are you here smiling and handing out boxes? Don&#39;t try to butter us up before you bite.&#34;</p>
