                <p>Tristan had been wondering which fool dared to stir up trouble on his territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, watching Eliana trapped within the hostile circle, every muscle in his spine coiled tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handsome features, moments before carved in indifference, hardened into ice as his gaze pierced through the mob surrounding Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raw fury crashed through him like wildfire,threatening to shatter the iron control he maintained over his emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Doran could react, Tristan launched himself toward the gathering storm of people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before he could do anything, a weathered yet commanding voice boomed across the chaos, &#34;I dare anyone to call the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice belonged to Davin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he had studied under Riley-Eliana&#39;s secret identity-her demanding schedule had kept them apart for over a year. Now, seeing her again, his heart  hammered with overwhelming joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rush of emotion had struck his chest like a physical blow, paralyzing him when she first faced their accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,with the crushing weight lifted from his chest,he shoved through the crowd and planted himself like a shield before Eliana. &#34;I dare anyone to lay a finger on her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan froze mid-stride, his intended words stolen from his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the gathered crowd alike.Bewilderment painted their faces as they struggled to understand why Davin would champion Eliana. After all,she had torn apart his work and stood accused of masquerading as Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda broke the stunned silence first. &#34;Mr. Gordon,why are you defending her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Davin lost his mind? Or did Eliana&#39;s beauty cloud his judgment? The questions swirled through Frieda&#39;s confused thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several onlookers remembered Davin&#39;s public declaraton that Riley served as his teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices rose in agreement with Frieda. &#34;Exactly. Mr.Gordon, why defend someone who mocked your  teacher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage coursed through Davin&#39;s trembling frame.Yet his stooped shoulders squared with remarkable dignity.His tolerance shattered completely as he roared above their voices, &#34;Have you all lost your minds? She impersonated no one. She&#39;s Riley-the real Riley,my teacher!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His declaration crashed into absolute silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation struck everyone speechless, Tristan included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had harbored suspicions that Eliana was Riley-her handwriting mirrored Riley&#39;s too perfectly to ignore.But the universal assumption that Riley was male had buried those doubts quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Davin had shattered that assumption with his public revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s white-knuckled fists gradually relaxed. He realized the hero&#39;s role had been claimed by another.Relief and disappointment warred within him in equal measure. A smile crept across his lips without his permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s eyes bulged with shock. Eliana as Riley? The notion seemed impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked as she stammered, &#34;Mr. Gordon, are  you certain? Did I mishear you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin fixed Frieda with a withering stare. Had she not obstructed his view, he would have recognized Eliana immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always held her in the highest reverence,despite the decades that separated their ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Frieda dared question Eliana&#39;s identity, his face transformed into a mask of outrage. &#34;Though age has dimmed my eyes, I&#39;m not so decrepit that I cannot recognize my own teacher! I stake my entire reputation on this truth-she is Riley, the legendary painter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s fierce endorsement silenced every skeptical voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Davin himself had spoken. No one would gamble their reputation on a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet disbelief lingered-Riley, a woman? And so remarkably young?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A year has passed since I last saw my teacher, and with you guysblocking my view, I failed to recognize her immediately. That failure rests on my shoulders alone. But anyone who questions her identity now questions my honor!&#34; Davin declared with unwavering conviction. Nervous glances ricocheted through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Larry Craig, the exhibition&#39;s curator,burst through the crowd after hearing the disturbance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant his gaze found Eliana,his eyes blazed with recognition, and he fought through the crowd to reach her, dropping into a respectful bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words tumbled out in breathless excitement,&#34;Far too long, Riley! Why didn&#39;t you announce your visit?would have rolled out the red carpet myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Davin&#39;s revelation had been a bombshell, Larry&#39;s confirmation struck like lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two titans of the art world acknowledging Eliana as Riley sealed her identity beyond question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt evaporated like morning mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apologies erupted from the crowd like a dam bursting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive us, Riley. We were blind to your identity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My ignorance shames me. Please accept my apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your youth caught us all off guard. We were fools!Please forgive us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each apology struck Frieda like a physical blow,her  face burning with crushing humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit her like a sledgehammer-Eliana was actually Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dug deep into Eliana&#39;s background, collecting every scrap of information Leyla offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to her intelligence, Eliana was nothing more than a rural nobody the Murrays had dragged back to the city-uneducated and unremarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality had just delivered a devastating blow to her assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s thoughts turned venomous toward Leyla-how dare she withhold the truth that despite Eliana&#39;s humble origins, she commanded national fame as Riley, a master of oil painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Leyla revealed this truth earlier, she reasoned bitterly, this public humiliation could have been avoided entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the crowd surged forward in their newfound worship,clamoring for photos with Eliana, Frieda ground her teeth in raw jealousy and began her silent retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp command cut through her escape. &#34;Stop right there!&#34; Rocco&#39;s voice rang with authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had stood guard over Eliana, ready to shield her from the mob&#39;s rage.Now, with her safety secured, his hunter&#39;s gaze locked onto Frieda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda froze mid-step, her spine turning to steel as she lifted her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within heartbeats, Rocco materialized in front of her like a shadow given form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s brow furrowed as she demanded, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley or not, Frieda refused to tolerate disrespect from a mere bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was, after all, a Larson-heiress to an empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s steel-gray eyes bored into her soul, his voice dropping to arctic temperatures. &#34;You poisoned this crowd with lies, nearly destroying Ms. Murray&#39;s reputation in the process. Did you honestly believe you could simply walk away unscathed?&#34;</p>
