                <p>&#34;She probably just went in to snoop. There wasn&#39;t anything worth much in there, right?&#34; Eliana asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I&#39;m not into all those fancy luxury things... but I do like buying them for you,&#34; Carl replied with a sheepish grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. As long as nothing valuable was there,&#34;Eliana said, her tone hardening. &#34;Next time she shows up,don&#39;t let her in again. And change the front-gate code-no point giving her another chance to upset Damon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Close acquaintance could always strike where it hurt the most. Leyla was that type-cold-blooded enough to twist the knife without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon had once treated her kindly, yet she had the heart to hurt him with her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t going to let her get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll change it right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No rush,&#34; she replied, &#34;I&#39;ll send you an address. Go change clothes and be on your way immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl agreed without bothering to ask for more details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could offer more explanation, her phone buzzed with another incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the caller,ID. Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up on Carl and answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana, you haven&#39;t forgotten our agreement, have you?&#34; Tristan&#39;s voice came low, warm, and velvety enough to curl around her like smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax.I remember. I&#39;ll be at the exhibition in an houshe replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about I come get you now? I&#39;ve got a dress for you, and I can bring it along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; she said flatly. &#39;&#34;T&#39;m not home. I&#39;ll head over right away when I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you? I can meet you instead,&#34; Tristan pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re being a little too nosy, aren&#39;t you? I said I&#39;ll meet you there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her tone must have reached him because he gave a low chuckle and backed off.&#34;Alright then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Call me when you arrive-I&#39;ll have someone escort you in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Bye for now.&#34; Eliana ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned just as Seth rushed in, arms full of documents. He wasn&#39;t sure where to keep them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They should go in innermost room,&#34; Elaina told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gotit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minutes bled away in a blur of tasks. By the time Eliana checked her watch,she had twenty minutes left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her bag and had Seth drive her straight to the venue-an exhibition hall named The Infinite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the crown jewel of Qidence&#39;s art scene, a space every top artist dreamed of booking, where reputations were made and careers cemented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana knew it well-the curator had invited her more than once to showcase her paintings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her, painting was just a quiet hobby, not a career move, so she&#39;d always declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Leyla arrived at the entrance of the exhibition hall with a friend who&#39;d been buzzing with anticipation fordays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leyla, you&#39;re amazing!&#34; the friend gushed, clutching her arm. &#34;Even my dad couldn&#39;t get tickets, and you got them for me! You should&#39;ve seen his face when I told him-I think he was jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla let a faint smile slip, basking in the admiration. &#34;It was nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The praise settled over her like warm silk, feeding her smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she dialed Davin&#39;s number. &#34;Mr. Gordon, my friend and I are at the entrance.&#34; ＂Alright， I甲 come get you，＂ he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Davin appeared at the doors, and the crowd&#39;s humn rose instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that the oil painting master, Davin Gordon?I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s here...If I&#39;d known he would be hers today, I&#39;d have given my ticket to my grandpa-he&#39;s a huge fan of Mr. Gordon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like he&#39;s meeting someone. Who could be so important that he would come out to meet them himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla caught the whispers and fought to keep the smug smile off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted a hand in a graceful wave. &#34;Mr. Gordon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting her through the crowd, Davin&#39;s eyes lit with recognition. He gave a brief nod and, flanked by two security guards, made his way toward Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movement drew stares instantly. Heads turned. Envy shimmered in the air like static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some recognized her. The whispers picked up again. &#34;Isn&#39;t that Leyla from the Murray family? She knows Mr.Gordon? Could she be his newest student?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t he stop taking students years ago.Maybe her talent&#39;s so extraordinary he made an exception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s probably the case,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait.You mean that Murray family? The bankrupt one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I heard they just brought back some long-lost daughter from the countryside. Stella kicked Leyla out afterwards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; an incredulous voice exclaimed. &#34;They kicked out someone handpicked by Mr. Gordon? Didn&#39;t they realize her potentials?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. No wonder the family&#39;s in ruins-short-sighted, the lot of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard all six sons are incompetent. And that daughter they brought back from the countryside? Probably not worth much either. Tossing a gem for rubble. Pathetic!&#34; Exactly. It would be a miracle if they still manage to stay afloat after now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices blended into a cruel undercurrent around her, every comment nastier than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla caught enough to know what was being said, but she kept her expression smooth, as though the words had slid right past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled up at Davin. &#34;Thank you for gifting me the tickets,Mr.Gordon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin, older and slightly hard of hearing, was unaware of the murmurs. Stroking his graying beard, he said warmly, &#34;When I saw your painting last time, I knew you had remarkable talent. It&#39;s my honor you could make it today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You flatter me,&#34; Leyla said, voice laced with faux modesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all. You&#39;ve got more skill than the other students I teach. I&#39;m eager to see what you do in today&#39;s competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes brightened. &#34;Will you be competing too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, shaking his head. &#34;I&#39;m too old for that. This is your stage, not mine. I&#39;ll be sitting with the other judges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla nodded with practiced grace. &#34;I understand. I&#39;ll do my best not to disappoint you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin gave her a warm smile.&#34;Good. There&#39;s stiff competition today. Don&#39;t put too much pressure on yourself. Win or lose, treat it as a learning experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come,&#34; he said, gesturing toward the hall. &#34;Let&#39;s go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; With her.friend in tow, Leyla followed him toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ticket check hadn&#39;t begun yet, so those without connections could only watch from the sidelines, their envy trailing after her like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the space was even more breathtaking than it looked from outside. Paintings for the charity auction hung suspended from sleek, nearly invisible wires, giving the entire half a futurtstic air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is gorgeous,&#34; her friend breathed, scanning the crowd for Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, her eyes lit up as she spotted him standing before a painting that seemed to be floating in air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gripped Leyla&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Leyla-look. Mr. Pearson&#39;s over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her gaze, Leylä&#39;s eyes landed on Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,he wore a midnight-blue suit that fit like it had been made for him. On his chest, an obsidian-studded brooch caught the light in subtle flashes. The combination of elegance and restraint made his presence magnetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a way of owning any room he stepped into. Even without the weight of Pearson Group&#39;s power, his presence alone turned heads-magnetic, effortless, impossible to ignore.</p>
