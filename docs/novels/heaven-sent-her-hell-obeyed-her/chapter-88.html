                <p>Leyla couldn&#39;t wrap her head around what she had just heard. How could Eliana possibly be the legendary oil painting master, Riley? Davin had to be mistaken. Or worse, Eliana had fooled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she remembered... Frieda had said the same thing. Her stomach twisted. Could it really be true?Was it possible Eliana was Riley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s voice cut through her thoughts. &#34;When I hit a dead end in my painting, it was Riley who tutored me-personally. I begged her to take me in as her student. And you think I mistook her for someone else? Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes bulged, nearly popping out of their sockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Personally tutored him? That meant he&#39;d seen Riley face-to-face. And... Eliana really was his teacher. She had mocked Eliana right in front of Davin. She had shot herself in the leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of his odd expression when she spoke... And Frieda&#39;s fury on the phone-everything snapped into place. Eliana wasn&#39;t some nobody. She was the great oil painting master herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face went chalk white, then burned crimson in a rush of fury. Her jaw tightened, lips trembling as her expression froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she could sweet-talk her.way into Davin&#39;s good graces, trick him into keeping her as a student.Little did she know she was making a fool of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she could become his student ever again. She had only just gained the title of Davin&#39;s student, only just tasted it and it was slipping away before she&#39;d even worn it properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole body quivered with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure whether she was angrier at Eliana... or at herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move,&#34; Davin snapped. &#34;I&#39;m done wasting my time.&#34; He shoved past her and headed for the door. He reached for the doorknob-then froze. A stabbing pain ripped through his chest. His breath caught,legs buckled, and he collapsed, clutching at his shirt as though he could hold his heart together with his bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla stumbled forward, startled. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My...chest...&#34; He choked on the words, face twisted with agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened. Why was this happening? &#34;Do you-do you have a heart condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Davin remembered Eliana&#39;s warning before he left. She had told him something might be wrong with his heart and handedshim a pill, insisting he carry it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling fingers, he fumbled for it in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pill slipped from his hand, clinking against the floor and rolling to rest at Leyla&#39;s feet. His voice came out broken, desperate. &#34;The pill... give me the pill..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla bent to pick it up, her hand hovering over the small white tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened slowly, eyes narrowing as a cold gleam slid across her face. She said softly, twisting the pill between her fingers, &#34;Didn&#39;t you just say I&#39;m no longer your student?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin smile curled her lips, sharp as glass. &#34;Then why should I give this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in disbelief. He never imagined she could be this cruel. &#34;Give it...to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, voice laced with venom. &#34;No. I despise Eliana Murray. So why would I give you, her student,the pill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled from her throat, brittle and giddy, like she had just stumbled upon the sweetest irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today had left her humiliated, disgraced beyond bearing. But if Davin died here, that shame would vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when Eliana learned her student was gone, surely she would grieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought alone filled Leyla with savage delight. Why would she save him? Davin&#39;s chest throbbed harder with every beat, pain exploding through his ribs. Gasping, he summoned the last of his strength, forcing out a broken plea. &#34;Someone... help-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Leyla lunged forward, clamping her hand over his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound died in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s eyes widened in horror. He clawed at her wrist, fingers trembling with desperation. But he didn&#39;t have much strength left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands slipped uselessly against her skin, unable to break her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath came shorter and weaker. His hold on her hand faltered, then slackened altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fluttered closed, and his body sagged,motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla snatched her hand back on instinct, chest rising and falling in shallow bursts. But his fingers still clung to her, cold and rigid, leaving her frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he...dead? She leaned closer, watching his chest. Nothing moved. No breath. No rise, no fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted. Relief? Terror? She couldn&#39;t tell. Gritting her teeth, she pried his hand off hers. His fingernails dragged across her skin, leaving two angry, bloody scratches on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; She winced, sucking in a sharp breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly yanked down her sleeve to cover the marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear rushed in where her rage had been. Outside, Davin&#39;s bodyguards were waiting. They&#39;d seen her bring him in. If he was dead... she&#39;d be the first suspect. She needed to come up with something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began pacing, mind spinning, hands wringing together. Then an idea flashed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging Davin&#39;s limp weight, she propped him into a chair, slumping him forward as though he&#39;d collapsed mid-thought. Her chest burned with the effort. She shoved the pill-the one that might have saved him-out the window into the greenery below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she was done, her lungs screamed for air. She steadied her breathing, smoothed her clothes, and ran to the door. Throwing it open, she cried out,voice trembling but loud enough to carry, &#34;Help! Somebody help! Mr. Gordon just slumped!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two bodyguards outside dropped thei cigarettes, rushing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon!&#34; one of them shouted, hurrying to Davin&#39;s side. They shook him, checked for a pulse,panic flashing in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin remained unresponsive. One bodyguard grabbed his phone, calling for an ambulance while the other tried to administer emergency aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla stood near the wall, wringing her hands, eyes wet with false tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard on the phone split his attention, murmuring reassurances to Leyla even as he barked details to the emergency line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, café staff crowded into the room, their anxious voices rising and overlapping until the air was thick with confusion and panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,across town, Eliana and Carl were just leaving the exhibition hall when Tristan&#39;s voice called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Murray, wait a moment.&#34; Carl turned, polite. Tristan&#39;s eyes glinted. &#34;You do know what the prize is for the winner this time, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl nodded.&#34;Lia told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Tristan&#39;s lips curved faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl chuckled. &#34;If you don&#39;t mind, I can start right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the Murray family&#39;s downfall, their remaining money had been bleeding away fast. Servants had been dismissed, luxuries cut, but it wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer&#39;s project needed funding, and Carl had felt powerless-until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Pearson Group gave him a position, at least he could shoulder some weight. Tristan gave a crisp nod. &#34;Alright then. You can report to the branch office tomorrow. I&#39;ll have a position arranged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl opened his mouth to thank him-when Rocco rushed in, face pale, voice breathless. &#34;Mr. Pearson,something&#39;s happened.&#34;</p>
