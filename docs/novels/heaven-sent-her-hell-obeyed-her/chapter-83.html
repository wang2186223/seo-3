                <p>The announcement sparked an uproar that rippled through the hall. People&#39;s curiosity quickly snowballed into a chorus of speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do these paintings look almost the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels like the same artist painted both pieces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! Notice how the petals are outlined and how the whole image comes together. They&#39;re practically from the same painter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rising whispers reached Leyla&#39;s ears, and color drained from her face. Jeffry and Hector no longer crossed her mind. Escaping this place was the only thought pressing against her chest. Everything else could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,before she couldslip past the crowd, a slender but unyielding hand clampedaround her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running off so soon?&#34; Eliana&#39;s lips curled up, but her voice carried a dangerous edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, she wouldn&#39;t waste time dragging someone down in public, but Leyla had crossed the line by stealing Carl&#39;s design for her own advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When hardship fell on the Murray family, Leyla had been the first to abandon them. Now that opportunity was at stake, she dared to crawl back-and claim Carl&#39;s work as hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung when it benefited her, discarded when it didn&#39;t. The world didn&#39;t bend so easily to that kind of selfishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about petty humiliation. Eliana wanted fairness restored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your hands off me!&#34; Leyla snapped in a low voice, her eyes glittering with fury beneath the makeup,though her tone lacked courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm, almost mocking smile, Eliana replied, &#34;I&#39;ll let you walk away. Just not this moment.&#34; While speaking, she cast a knowing look at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her signal, Carl moved toward Tristan and Davin without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s first instinct was to reach out and stop him. However, Eliana&#39;s grip on her arm was unyielding, giving her no room to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any attempt to push forward was instantly shut down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration welled up inside Leyla as she watched Carl already launching into an explanation for Tristan and Davin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s expression darkened as his brows drew together. &#34;Wait a minute. Are you telling us Leyla stole your idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl replied without flinching, &#34;She didn&#39;t just take my concept. She recreated my entire painting. There&#39;s an identical painting sitting in my room right now. If you need proof, I can have someone bring it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin opened his mouth to respond, but a sudden thought made him pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out his phone, he scrolled through his gallery and held the screen out to Carl. &#34;Do you recognize this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance was enough for Carl to recognize the painting. &#34;That design came from me too, but those brushstrokes aren&#39;t mine. Someone else painted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words, another blatant plagiarism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s expression grew even darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned for Tristan, who now saw the direction Eliana wanted to steer this confrontation. He couldn&#39;t hide his amusement. Anything with her at the center had a way of pullinghim in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke up, saying, &#34;Let&#39;s not jump to conclusions without proof. Since today&#39;s event is tied to Pearson Group&#39;s latest launch... Mr. Murray, if you&#39;re willing, let&#39;s get that painting brought here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Carl wasted no time pulling out his phone and punched in Jordy&#39;s number, his tone brisk. &#34;Bring the painting right away. Yes, the one on the desk dated the first of this month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away!&#34; Jordy ended the call and rushed off to retrieve it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, the Murray estate sat only a short drivefrom the exhibition hall, and with clear roads, twenty minutes would be more than enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shared a quick glance with Rocco, who instantly got the message and hurried backstage. Rocco&#39;s voice rang out over the speakers. &#34;Attention, everyone. Due to a recent development in the competition,we&#39;ll be delaying the announcement of the final winner by thirty minutes. We apologize for the unexpected wait and appreciate your patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief announcement sent a new wave of whispers rippling through the crowd. &#34;Weren&#39;t they supposed to share the championship? Why is there trouble now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, it&#39;s not surprising. Since this contest is about picking a lead designer, only one can win in the end. They have to make a decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,a few in the audience who knew the art world started putting the pieces together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could it be that the paintings look too much alike?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we&#39;re looking at a case of plagiarism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation buzzed around the venue, but all eyes now watched for any hint about who would take the crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Eliana let go of Leyla&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Leyla stood there or not, the truth would surface all the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Leyla refused to surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed toward Davin, voice trembling with uncertainty. &#34;Mr. Gordon, please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin averted his eyes. &#34;I&#39;ve got nothing to say to you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion kept him silent. Leyla would get nothing more from him until every piece of evidence was in place. A flicker of worry darkened Leyla&#39;s features. &#34;Please, I&#39;m begging you-don&#39;t let their lies fool you. I need you to believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin answered without a trace of feeling, &#34;No matter what the truth is, I&#39;ll uncover it soon enough.Lies or not, the facts won&#39;t stay hidden for long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s fingers twisted together as she shot a desperate look at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s expression remained icy, watching her like she was nothing more than a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s breath hitched. She&#39;d sensed for a long time that he never truly accepted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she refused to stand idly by and do nothing. &#34;Carl, could we have a word in private? I only need a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say what you have to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s step aside, just for a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for secrets. If you&#39;ve got something to share, spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla bit back her frustration and said, &#34;I need to tell you something important. It&#39;s about Rowell. Aren&#39;t you the least bit curious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she brought up Rowell Murray, Carl&#39;s another brother, Carl paused, weighing her words,before finally walking with Leyla to a quiet corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl looked at her with little warmth. &#34;Well? I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla clung to Carl&#39;s sleeve and said, &#34;You already know my entry borrowed from your earlier work, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Borrowed, you say?&#34; Carl let out a sharp laugh, skepticism written across his face. &#34;Are you sure you didn&#39;t just take it outright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of hearing his biting remarks had taught Leyla how to mask her pain. She managed a strained grin and said, &#34;That&#39;s right, I admit I copied. I&#39;m only asking you to let it slide this one time. Think back to the days when we still called each other family. I swear I won&#39;t touch your work ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Family? Perhaps that word meant something before you made my mom put her name on those disownment papers. Whatever was left between us died that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla let go of her hand, her voice trembling. &#34;But if I tell you what&#39;s been holding Rowell back all this time-what&#39;s really kept him from makingit in the showbiz-would you help me, just this once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Carl&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;re saying you actually know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. But you&#39; have to give me your word first. Otherwise, Rowell might never get his shot, and he&#39;ll be stuck playing bit parts forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s stare grew sharper. &#34;So you&#39;re threatening me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t blackmail. I&#39;m offering you a fair exchange. Does the deal interest you or not?&#34;</p>
