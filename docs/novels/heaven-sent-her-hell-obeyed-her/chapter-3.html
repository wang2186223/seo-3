                <p>Pain pulsed at the base of Carl&#39;s neck, and he reached up to massage it while scanning his surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interior of his car felt unchanged, yet through the windshield rose the city&#39;s skyline, with the Pearl Tower cutting into the hazy distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit him-he was back in Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing he remembered was leaving the village with Eliana behind the wheel. At some point,darkness had taken over without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze darted around the car, and an uneasy realization struck-Eliana wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He twisted in his seat, straining to see, until he finally caught sight of her a few steps away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stood in conversation with a young man whose messy curls framed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The lab sent the results,&#34; the man said, his voice low but urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they say?&#34; asked Eliana, her eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering outright, the man passed her a thin folder. &#34;You might want to read it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed on Eliana&#39;s brow as a suspicion began to take shape in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped the report open, heading straight for the last page. The words stared back at her. &#34;Analysis of DNA samples from both parties supports a blood relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The report snapped shut in her hands, and her gaze darkened with a storm of unspoken emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For as long as she could remember, she had carried the belief that she was an orphan. If that weren&#39;t true, then surely she had been cast aside. That conviction had kept her from searching.Even with her talents and resources, she had never once tried to find them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, those who had thrown her away didn&#39;t deserve to be her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Learning the truth about her roots left her with a swirl of emotions she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the thought of rushing back to her family didn&#39;t sit right with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life alongside her subordinates had become her normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her closely, the curly-haired man finally asked, &#34;So, are you heading back to meet the Murray family? I did some digging. Besides you, they&#39;ve got six sons and one adopted daughter.The whole family situation is quite complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the folder back into his hands without hesitation. &#34;Complicated or not, I need to see it for myself.&#34; His face lit up with approval. &#34;Couldn&#39;t be better timing. We&#39;re shifting our headquarters to Qidence this year. Having connections here will smooth the way for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as she said, &#34;So, this was part of your plan all along-nudging me back to the Murray family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scratching at his curls, he gave a sheepish grin and responded, &#34;More like a move we can&#39;t avoid.Eighvale&#39;s market has been wrecked. Some unknown group came after us hard, and we&#39;ve been bleeding losses without even knowing their names. We need new ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let everyone know they should be ready to pack up at a moment&#39;s notice,&#34; Eliana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; he replied with a brisk nod. He started to turn away, then paused as something came to mind.&#34;Oh-while you were gone, we landed a big contract.It&#39;s for treating someone here. Since you&#39;re already in town, can you take it?&#34; &#34;What&#39;s their offer?&#34; Eliana inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They said if the patient recovers, we can name any price we want,&#34; the man answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana raised an eyebrow. &#34;Then let&#39;s mnake this our calling card in Qidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her last word had even faded, a faint noise came from inside the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her hand, Eliana sent the curly-haired man on his way, and he disappeared without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Carl walked up, his eyes trailing in the direction the man had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that, Lia?&#34; he asked, curiosity edging his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a driver I hired. He&#39;s the one who brought us into Qidence,&#34; Eliana answered casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Carl didn&#39;t question her, though his hand went to his neck. &#34;Strange... it&#39;s aching like crazy.&#34; &#34;You probably slept the whole ride and twisted it.That&#39;s all,&#34; she replied with the same easy tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think so?&#34; His eyes narrowed slightly, still unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure of it,&#34; Eliana said with a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her reassurance, a quiet doubt lingered in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time he tried to focus on what had happened earlier, the throbbing in his neck sharpened until he gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, all that mattered was that Eliana was with him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, let&#39;s head home. Mom and Dad must be waiting,&#34; Carl said, his excitement bubbling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s go.&#34; Eliana agreed, making no move to argue and letting him take the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl straightened in confidence, determined to keep the ride smooth. He hoped to show her he could handle the wheel, but the streets of Qidence were a mess-heavy traffic,endless red lights, and no room for speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over an hour later, their patience paid off as they passed through the gates of a grand estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze swept over the surroundings, and for the first time, she began to believe Carl&#39;s boast that the Murrays had been Qidence&#39;s richest family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck her that, as the acknowledged daughter of such a family, moving the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s headquarters here would be far easier than she&#39;d imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts barely had time to settle before the car rolled to a stop and she stepped out, only to spot several uniformed servants hauling luggage toward the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl stepped forward and stopped one of them.&#34;Briar, what&#39;s going on? Where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing him instantly, Briar Ward dipped his head in greeting before answering, &#34;There&#39;s been... a major change in the family while you were away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he explained, the picture became clear for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s father, Louis Murray, once Qidence&#39;s richest man, had been pulled into a high-profile economic investigation and taken into custody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alongside him, Damon and Sawyer Murray-the eldest and second sons-were also being held for questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Murray Group&#39;s empire had taken a crushing hit and the staff were being dismissed one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wages had just been settled, and those still loyal were now leaving with heavy hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl stood frozen, as though the words couldn&#39;t quite take root in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a gentle pull on his sleeve. &#34;Come on.Let&#39;s see for ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to jolt him back to reality. With a dazed expression clouding his features, he led her through the front doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room greeted them with a tense scene-a slim young woman knelt before a middle-aged woman in an elegant dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, please, I had no other choice... With everything falling apart here, the Clarkes won&#39;t take me unless | cut ties with our family. You don&#39;t have to worry; it&#39;s only for appearances. After I marry into the Clarke family, I&#39;ll still be able to help...&#34; the young woman pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Stella Murray&#39;s eyes slid shut, her expression one of quiet, aching disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family&#39;s downfall hadn&#39;t been an accident. It was a calculated move, partly to stall for time and build their influence, and partly to see if the younger generation could endure hardship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, after more than twenty years under her care,Leyla Murray-the adopted daughter-decided to walk away the moment trouble arrived. Even the servants who had been dismissed had quietly offered to return if the family needed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla, however, seemed determined to put as much distance between herself and the Murrays as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl didn&#39;t wait for her to speak. He strode forward and struck her across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her cheek, Leyla stared at him in disbelief.&#34;Carl,you actually hit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were cold as he snapped back, &#34;Yeah, I did.And why shouldn&#39;t I? You&#39;re just looking for a way to save yourself while we&#39;re drowning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Leyla began, her voice tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Marry anyone you want. We don&#39;t give a damn. You&#39;re not a Murray anymore!&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked between Carl and Stella, who said nothing. Then she let out a sharp laugh and rose to her feet. &#34;Alright then. You&#39;ve made it clear. This is your choice, not mine.&#34; From her bag, she drew a folded document and added, &#34;Sign this. From this moment on, your troubles aren&#39;t mine, and I won&#39;t care whether you guys end up in jail or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl snatched the severance papers before Stella could react and scribbled his name without hesitation. &#34;Done. Now get out!&#34;</p>
