                <p>Eliana had no intention of dragging out the pointless debate over Tristan&#39;s alleged girlfriend, so she moved to end things. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. You&#39;re a busy man-you should be on your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m hot in a hurry,&#34; Tristan replied smoothly.&#34;My coffee&#39;s not finished yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knuckles tightened as she fought the urge to punch his smug face. &#34;Then finish it quickly,&#34; she said through cenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every extra second with him felt like testing the limits of her own patience-and her restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when they first met, she hadn&#39;t pegged him as this shameless. Somehow, each meeting only seemed to strip away more of his restraint. Perhaps that explained why he and Jermaine were brothers-they were cut from the same irritating cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least Jermaine spoke like a normal person before pulling something indecent. Tristan&#39;s style was different -he kept his actions clean while making his words unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, she had no fondness for either man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate leisure, Tristan shrugged into his jacket, then settled back into his seat as if the evening belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single sip touched his lips before he set the cup back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then said casually, &#34;That reminds me. I forgot to ask-did you happen to visit the Glory Hotel in Eighvale about a year ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words came with a gaze that pinned her in place, watching for even the faintest flicker of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together. &#34;A year ago? What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just answer me, or I might make this coffee last all night,&#34; Tristan said. Biting back her irritation, she replied evenly,&#34;1go there often. I like the hot springs there. Hot springs are good for recovery, especially for someone who trains physically. WNhy does it matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice stayed steady, and her face revealed nothing-no guilt,no nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after admitting she&#39;d been to the hotel, her answer didn&#39;t seem to satisfy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe too much time had passed, and she had let the memory fade? Still, that felt unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For something like that, Tristan believed a girl would carry the memory for the rest of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He certainly did. That day still found its way into his dreams more often than he cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The haze of the moment had kept her face hidden, but the feeling it left behind had never slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he&#39;d þeen wrong all along, and Eliana wasn&#39;t the woman he had been searching for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea stirred a mess of emotions inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That mysterious girl had burned herself into his memory, yet meeting Eliana had pulled him toward her in a way he couldn&#39;t quite explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet part of him wanted her to be the same person. And his instincts insisted she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to let the matter drop, he asked again, &#34;When you visited, did anything... out of the ordinary happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit in confusion.&#34;Out of the ordinary? What exactly are you asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything at all,&#34; Tristan said lightly. &#34;Just making conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever patience she had left snapped. Her hand shot out, grabbing his coffee cup and tipping it onto the tray with a sharp clink. &#34;Nothing unusual or strange. But you are certainly a strange one. Planning to make yourself at home here forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could answer, his phone buzzed on the table. Rocco&#39;s name flashed on the screen. He didn&#39;t usually call unless something was wrong. Tristan answered, cutting in before his friend could speak. &#34;I&#39;ll be there shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended as he rose to his feet and he said to Eliana, &#34;Apologies for barging in today. Don&#39;t forget our arrangement.I&#39;4l send a car for you when the exhibition comes around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her reply, he turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tristan&#39;s figure vanished through the coffee room door, Eliana exhaled a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away from the table, she left the room and made her way upstairs to check on Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a full day of activity, Stella would need acupuncture to help ease her tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Sawyer had just finished seeing the last guests out and was heading toward the stairs for a long, hot shower when Tristan&#39;s tall frame appeared in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An involuntary twitch pulled at Sawyer&#39;s eyelid as he stepped forward. &#34;Mr. Pearson, you&#39;re still around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s mouth curved intoa faint smile. &#34;Had a little talk with Eliana, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, his fingers drifted casually to his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small gesture drew Sawyer&#39;s eyes-and that was when he noticed the black shirt missing a button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone of Tristan&#39;s stature, showing up to a formal banquet with a shirt in that state seemed unlikely unless the damage had happened tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent Sawyer&#39;s gaze upward justin time to catch Eliana hurrying up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An assumption formed almost instantly, and it wasn&#39;t a modest one. He didn&#39;t expect her to be so forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, with his entire family fond of Tristan, Sawyer found himself thinking it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Sawyer?&#34; Tristan&#39;s voice cut into his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound jolted Sawyer back to the present. Composure sliding back into place, he replied with a polite smile, &#34;What can I do for you, Mr.Pearson?&#34; &#34;I was thinking,&#34; Tristan said with a faint smirk, &#34;we&#39;re the same age and move in the same circ&#39;es0drop the formalities? Call me Tristan, and I&#39;ll call you Sawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34;Sawyer hesitated, uncertain If that was wise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at their strongest, the Murray family hadn&#39;t reached the Pearson family&#39;s level of influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with the Murrays facing hardship, the gap felt wider than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, plenty of people would consider it an honor to call Tristan by his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t give Sawer the option to refuse. His hand came down in a light pat on Sawyer&#39;s shoulder.&#34;You&#39;ve had a long day-go get some rest. I&#39;ve got a few things to take care of, soI&#39;ll be heading out.P&#39;stop by again sometime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he crossed the hall in long, confident strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts spun quickly through Sawyer&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had only met a handful of times, and though they weren&#39;t friends, he had learned enough to know Tristan&#39;s nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friendliness for the sake of small talk wasn&#39;t Tristan&#39;s style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer couldn&#39;t shake the thought that-Tristan&#39;s friendliness might have more to do with Eliana than with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind jumped back to the banquet, remembering how Tristan had reappeared from outside with Eliana by his side-Carl claiming they&#39;d gotten lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet tonight, Tristan left without a single mention.of losing his way. That alone told Sawyer the man knew exactly where he was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pieces that once felt scattered now fit together neatly./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea settled in Sawyer&#39;s mind: the Murray family could be preparing for a wedding soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of his father still sitting in a prison cell stole the shine from that vision. Would Louis even get the chance to watch Eliana walk down the aisle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days slipped by before he had time to dwell on it further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During that time, Leyla busied herself with outings among her closest friends-afternoons at the spa,lunches at fashionable cafés-hoping to catch whispers of gossip about the Murray family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She expected to hear snickers about a lavish banquet that barely drew any guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the silence on the matter stretched on for two full days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,she could no longer keep up the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At lunch, she let out a sigh that sounded almost unplanned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two elegantly dressed women across the table immediately glanced her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leyla, what&#39;s the matter?&#34; one asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head tilted as Leyla gave a faint smile tinged with bitterness.&#34;O, nothing... I&#39;m just feeling low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why&#39;s that?&#34; the other asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another breath, Leyla let her voice soften. &#34;It&#39;s because of the Murray family. They threw me out for Eliana&#39;s sake, but even after all that, I never felt hatred toward them. They raised me, after all, and I&#39;ll always be grateful for that.&#34;</p>
