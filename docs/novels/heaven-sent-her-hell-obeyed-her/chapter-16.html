                <p>Minutes slipped by before Eliana finally stepped into Miguel&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man lay half-awake beneath an oxygen mask, thin as parchment, the soft beeping of machines marking every fragile moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the equipment entirely, Eliana trusted her own way of doing things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers wrapped gently around Miguel&#39;s frail wrist as she concentrated on hearing his pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers seemed frozen, hardly daring to take a breath. Only Tristan kept his eyes fixed on Eliana&#39;s face,wrestling with the thought that he had seen her somewhere before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time dragged on before Eliana let go of Miguel&#39;s arm. Jeffry seized the moment to ask, &#34;Doctor, can you help my father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze met his, but the eager intensity in his eyes unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though his worry had more to do with his own situation than with the man on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that was something outside Eliana&#39;s concern.She answered with steady composure, &#34;Your father isn&#39;t sick. He&#39;s simply old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it been an illness, she could have treated it.Yet the turning of life&#39;s wheel was beyond the reach of medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel&#39;s troubles were the slow wear of years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bodies worked like well-used machines, prone to jamming or breaking after too long. But unlike metal parts, a human being couldn&#39;t be swapped out for something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A transplant here or there might extend life, yet a full renewal was impossible and MigueI&#39;s state could not endure such invasive attempts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s face fell at once, disappointment cutting through him. If even the doctor secured through the Onyx Syndicate could do nothing, then Miguel&#39;s fate was already sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Leyla&#39;s voice cut through the air.&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Clarke, I warned you she&#39;s a fraud!That famous doctor you were looking for? This isn&#39;t her! Think about it-how could someone so celebrated fail to cure an illness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla had been sent away earlier in disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Hector&#39;s car rolled into view, she wasted no time in calling him. So, it was Hector who escorted her straight inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of expression on her face, Eliana answered, &#34;I already told you. He isn&#39;t sick. He&#39;s just old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old? That&#39;s your diagnosis? You can&#39;t even figure out what&#39;s wrong and you expect us to swallow that? Do you think we&#39;re fools?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s jaw tightened, his thoughts shifting fast.More than anyone else, he refused to watch Miguel die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana earlier statement had dragged him into despair, yet Leyla&#39;s accusation rekindled a dangerous ember of hope. If the renowned doctor was still out there, then perhaps his father&#39;s fate wasn&#39;t sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me. Are you the doctor we&#39;ve been searching for, or aren&#39;t you?&#34; Jeffry asked coldly, staring at Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow tightened, irritation shadowing her voice. &#34;What&#39;s this now? Back to doubting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry opened his mouth to answer but froze when he caught sight of Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly snatching the white card from Ruby, he handed it over. &#34;Mr. Pearson, you know your stuff.Can you check if this card&#39;s the reaI thing? If it is, I&#39;ll  admit I was wrong. But if it isn&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left the last words unsaid, yet the threat in his tone landed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana remained unfazed. She knew the truth could not be faked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached for the card with slow, deliberate ease. One quick look was enough for him to decide.&#34;It&#39;s the real thing,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Onyx Syndicate had their cards crafted to perfection. Even Tristan&#39;s skills would fail to imitate one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red rose emblem on it was very intricate, more complex than the currency, and no one in the market could reproduce such a card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s mood sank at the confirmation. Shame kept his eyes off Eliana, and he turned his anger on Leyla.Without her, he would not have doubted Eliana&#39;s identity. &#34;| warned you to stay away from our property. Who gave you permission to step inside?&#34; Color drained from her face, and she instinctively turned to Hector for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease gnawed at Hector. Why must she speak up at such a time? Even so, he would stand up for her. &#34;I was the one who brought her in, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her out! Do not drag strays into our home! This house is not a place anyone can walk into!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult twisted Leyla&#39;s features. Strays? Did Jeffry mean her? Damn it! This mess was all on Eliana.Where had she even gotten that card?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re done here, Leyla. Let&#39;s leave,&#34; said Hector,already reading the irritation on Jeffry&#39;s face and deciding it was best to get her out for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Leyla refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on Eliana, and she said, &#34;If you&#39;re truly this renowned doctor they claim you are, then why can&#39;t you cure Mr. Clarke? And even if he&#39;s old,there has to be a way to keep him alive for a few more years.&#34; Eliana raised her eyebrows. &#34;And who told you |couldn&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple question drew every gaze toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry, more desperate than anyone else, nearly tripped over his words. &#34;Doctor, please, I let myself be misled by her earlier-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had no patience for his rambling. The decision to treat the patient was already made, and she intended to collect a fee worth her trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting him off with a raised hand, she said, &#34;You don&#39;t have to explain. I&#39;ll handle it. But there&#39;s one thing I want first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what is that? Whatever it is, we&#39;ll make it happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her finger landed on Leyla without hesitation. &#34;Get her out of my sight. She&#39;s nothing but noise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla blinked in shock, a flicker of loathing sparking in her gaze. Jeffry said quickly, &#34;That won&#39;t be a problem! Hector,get Leyla out of here now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching Hector&#39;s sleeve, Leyla blurted out, &#34;Don&#39;t believe a word she says, Hector! She&#39;s nothing but a fraud-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough, Leyla. We&#39;re leaving,&#34; said Hector,his tone edged with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t give her a chance to argue again as he dragged her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla found herself facing another round of disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the Clarkes, who had barely tolerated her before, seemed disgusted beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla cursed Eliana inwardly. She believed it was all Eliana&#39;s fault and there was no way she&#39;d ever let her get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Eliana told a servant to strip off Miguel&#39;s shirt before asking, &#34;Have you gathered everything I told you to prepare?&#34; &#34;Everything is here. Except for one herb. My daughter went to get it, and she should be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;ll start working now.&#34; Eliana took the sterilized tool the maids had laid out and began the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Hector escorted Leyla to the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hector, you doubt me as well?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weary sigh, he said, &#34;You acted too recklessly today. This isn&#39;t about me believing you or not.My dad... he can&#39;t risk losing my grandpa. Even if he suspects she&#39;s a fraud, he still has to take the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparked with sudden hope. &#34;So your parents don&#39;t truly think that bitch can heal your grandpa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector gave a short nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla regained her strength. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll wait by the gates. She won&#39;t even notice me. Just let me stay,I&#39;m begging you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her only wish was to witness the moment Eliana&#39;s failure became undeniable, to watch the punishment that came when Miguel&#39;s illness went uncured.</p>
