                <p>Next door, Sean had seemed to be recovering until a single sip of water set off a harsh cough that ended in a spray of blood. The color was almost black, carrying a heaviness that made the air in the room feel colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eliana stepped inside, the floor was already streaked with a dark, spreading pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia...&#34; Sean&#39;s voice cracked; his eyes lit faintly the moment they landed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please keep our relationship a secret for now,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t fully trust Tristan. His ties ran deep and tangled,and she wasn&#39;t ready for him to know she bore the Murray bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean didn&#39;t ask why and simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright? Did they do anything to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she replied, her voice steady but quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent over him, studying his face and pulse for any sign of something worse. After several tense seconds, she let her breath go and turned toward Tristan, who lingered just inside the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you stash my clothes?&#34; she asked, her gaze fixed on Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight tilt of Tristian&#39;s head was all it took for Doran to step forward, a bag already in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened it, her clothes were folded inside,along with the familiar pouch she never traveled without.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand slipped into the pouch, pulling out a slim glass bottle. She shook out a single black pill and pressed it into Sean&#39;s palm. &#34;Take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Sean would&#39;ve questioned her first. This time, he didn&#39;t hesitate-he swallowed it in one motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed with one of her own, the pill disappearing down her throat without a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes stayed on her. &#34;That&#39;s the antidote to the toxin, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; she said, holding another pill toward him. &#34;You were in that room too. Take one. That gym was swarming with people, and I had to play it differently to make sure we could get out clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered, steady and unblinking, loaded with unspoken judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana read the unspoken accusation in his eyes-he was telling her without words that her plan had fallen short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flared, and she retorted, &#34;That&#39;s on Flint Moore.The man&#39;s slipperier than l expected. If I&#39;d seen it coming, he wouldn&#39;t have lasted long enough to call it a fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Storming the Fist Guild gym alone hadn&#39;t been an act of ego. She knew she had the skill to break them apart piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she hadn&#39;t counted on was Seth&#39;s intel being off -and Flint proving far more dangerous and unpredictable than expected. That miscalculation had cost her the win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said a word,&#34; Tristan remarked, his tone carrying more weight than the words themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. Whatever she had been about to say withered, and she lost the urge to speak to him entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift in her expression told Tristian enough-she was angry-but for once, he truly hadn&#39;t said anything. He drew a breath to respond, but the door opened and Rocco stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir...&#34; His eyes flicked towvard Eliana and Sean, as if debating whether to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no one here who doesn&#39;t need to hear it,&#34;Tristan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco nodded and spoke quickly. &#34;The Fist Guild&#39;s members have all been rounded up, but things on the floor are messy. The police chief has hit a wall,and he&#39;s asking for you to come in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; Tristan said with a nod. His attention shifted to Eliana. &#34;Why don&#39;t you both stay here until this is settled? You could use the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary,&#34; Eliana replied without hesitation. &#34;We&#39;ve already imposed on you long enough. We&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped an arm under Sean&#39;s to help him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his feet hit the floor, his legs gave out,and he nearly crumpled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reluctant sigh escaped her. &#34;Looks like we might have to trouble you a bit longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more than enough space here,&#34; Tristan said  with a faint smile. &#34;Stay as long as you need. I&#39;ll take care of the situation and be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a short nod, watching him disappear through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Sean, she eased him onto the bed and asked, &#34;Tell me how you&#39;re actually feeling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; he said quickly, trying to sound casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow tightened. &#34;I&#39;m your doctor right now. If you want to survive this, drop the act and tell me the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean exhaled and replied, &#34;Earlier, it was bad.I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. But after your pill,it&#39;s easier to breathe...only my chest feels like it&#39;s been crushed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s body swayed, the pain threatening to drag him under, his legs barely able to hold him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t waste a second before stepping in to check him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it hurt when I press here?&#34; she asked, applying gentle pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he answered, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shifted her hand to another spot. &#34;And here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face drained of color, lips paling as he flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her hand back, she said firmly, &#34;Two ribs are fractured. You&#39;ll need real rest if you expect them to heal. Nothing else is wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rib fractures weren&#39;t like cuts or sprains-there was no treatment except patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a trained boxer, Sean understood exactly what that diagnosis meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How am I supposed to face Mom like this?&#34; he asked,worry creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s tone turned sharp. &#34;Now you&#39;re thinking about how she&#39;ll react? You should&#39;ve thought about that before running off like you were untouchable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t acting without thinking,&#34; Sean said quickly.&#34;I slipped away, planning to surprise you with a custom jewelry set. I&#39;d just finished the design with the clerk when members of the Fist Guild grabbed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would they do that if you&#39;re connected to them?&#34;Eliana asked, her brows knitting in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;The store&#39;s owned by the Fist Guild. In fact, the whole mall belongs to them.Something went missing from the jewelry store, and they accused me of stealing it.&#34; &#34;What exactly did they say was taken?&#34; Eliana asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rare boxing manual,&#34; he answered, his voice tight.&#34;But I swear I never touched it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed him-he had no reason to lie to her about something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said with a firm nod. &#34;I&#39;ll find out the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, there was no question. If the Fist Guild had ignored Sean&#39;s ties and treated him like a criminal,the missing item had to be important-important enough to matter even to the Onyx Syndicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the real thief had set Sean up, she wasn&#39;t going to let them walk free, no matter that the Fist Guild was already in custody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weren&#39;t you living in the countryside all this time?When did you learn to fight like that?&#34; asked Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who decided people in the countryside can&#39;t be skilled fighters?&#34; she replied evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;True. Plenty of masters retire to quiet places where no one will find them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through speaking, a wave of fatigue hit him hard. The sedative the doctor had given before his coughing fit was starting to work, its effects dulling the pain and pulling him toward sleep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the change in his expression, Eliana said,&#34;Rest for a while. When you&#39;re feeling stronger, we&#39;ll head back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Sean murmured, sinking back into the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind if I borrow your phone to tell the family you&#39;re safe?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead.&#34; He passed it over without hesitation. The screen was cracked in two places, but it still lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A photo filled the display-Sean and Leyla, standing side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the cap and gown Leyla wore, Eliana guessed it was taken on Leyla&#39;s graduation day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean caught her glance and scratched the back of his neck. &#34;Leyla told me to set it as my wallpaper.I just..never got around to changing it.&#34;</p>
