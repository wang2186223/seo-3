                <p>Had Leyla discovered earlier that Davin was a man who carried both unshakable principles and a generous heart, she would have approached him long ago to earn his goodwill. If she had managed that,becoming his student might have happened much sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that title, the Clarkes could have seen her as a worthy match and perhaps welcomed her into their fold without hesitation. Still, she knew it wasn&#39;t too late to change her path now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, I&#39;d be honored! I only worry that my skills might fall short and end up tarnishing your name,&#34; said ,Leyla, her heart alight with excitement even as she kept her tone humble and her expression modest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile, Davin gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. &#34;There&#39;s no need to downplay yourself.I know how to recognize talent when I see it.&#34; Her work already carried a distinct signature, though it still bore the traces of youthful inexperience. With the right guidance, he figured, she had the potential to become renowned all over the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much!&#34; Leyla replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same time, Elíana reached the entrance of the exhibition hall. She&#39;d tapped out a quick message to Tristan,then lifted her eyes to take in the sweeping architecture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What most people didn&#39;t realize was that this masterpiece had been her creation, completed when she was just eighteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing it rise before her in all its glory stirred a deep swell of emotion within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quiet moment was broken when a voice called out-someone who had attended her welcome banquet just days earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Ms. Murray? She got invited as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment sparked curiosity among those nearby,and heads turned toward where the speaker was looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far edge of the red carpet stood a young woman radiating a poised elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of a gown like the other women wore,she was dressed in a crisp white suit tailored to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the jacket was a silky white blouse, its collar slightly open to reveal a graceful collarbone adorned with a diamond pendant that caught the light with every movement. Straight white trousers flowed seamlessly down her long legs, enhancing her striking height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the breeze swept past, the hem of her jacket swayed, as though even the wind acknowledged her quiet authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried herself with effortless authority, the kind that made her seem like the one running the entire event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One sweeping glance from her was enough to draw collective awe, especially from those wvho had previously dismissed her in favor of Leyla&#39;s so-called brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t she supposed to have grown up in a poor family? How can she carry herself like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s far prettier than Leyla. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not everyone was willing to join in the admiration.One voice cut through with a sneer. &#34;Oh, please. It&#39;s just the outfit. Dress any woman well enough and she&#39;ll look the part. For all we know, she&#39;s hiding a terrible figure under that suit. Her family&#39;s broke, but they must have scraped together enough to hire a whole team of stylists to make sure she passes for refined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speaker&#39;s original plan had been to tear down Eliana&#39;s appearance by claiming her beauty was all makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the sunlight betrayed the truth-her skin was flawless, untouched by even the faintest trace of cosmetics. Unable to fault her appearance, the woman who had mocked Eliana earlier latched onto something else.&#34;So she&#39;s pretty, big deal. Leyla&#39;s got Davin Gordon himself greeting her, while Eliana&#39;s standing here like the rest of us, waiting for a ticket check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until then, Eliana had been absorbed in admiring the building she had brought to life on paper years ago,only now noticing the quiet murmurs around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the words were hushed, one name reached her ears-Davin Gordon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they talking about that stubborn old man who had insisted she should take him on as a student? So he was here today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course he&#39;d be here; he never missed an art exhibition. Actually, the timing worked in her favor.&#39;Lately, his work had shown a clear decline in finesse,and she wasn&#39;t about to let that association dull her own name. This might be her chance to remind him,tactfully or not, to sharpen his skills where they&#39;d begun to slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden stir ran through the entrance as a.group stepped into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes shifted toward the newcomers without a second thought. At the center of the entourage strode an impossibly handsome man, flanked on all sides by bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if he carried his own glow, each step drawing quiet awe, and the girls near the doors could only gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s got to be Mr. Pearson. I heard he was attractive, but seeing him up close... it&#39;s almost unreal.I&#39;d call this trip worth it already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s really Mr. Pearson? He looks like he walked straight out of a movie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard his brother, Jermaine Pearson, is more handsome than most celebrities. But now that Tristan Pearson&#39;s here, I can&#39;t even remember what Jermaine looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your voice down. It&#39;s not wise to talk too freely about the Pearsons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single reminder smothered the murmurs in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the question lingered-what was Tristan doing here now? Was he waiting to receive someone important? Who could warrant Tristan Pearson&#39;s personal welcome? Could it be Elbert Pearson himself?But if the rumors were true,Elbert was still confined to bed and couldn&#39;t possibly appear in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation only deepened with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot near the entrance, Eliana finally caught sight of him after several long minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit together, and she shifted forward, but the press of bodies around her kept her from moving any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People surged forward,each trying to get as close to Tristan as possible, desperate to grab this rare moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests might have been dripping with wealth or power, but at an event hosted by the Pearson family,status melted away-no one wanted to squander a chance to stand in Tristan&#39;s shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Blocked from advancing, Eliana was just about to call and ask him to send someone to escort her in through a quieter entrance-when she caught sight of him moving directly toward her with his entourage in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had already seen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, his bodyguards moved into action,parting the crowd with swift, decisive gestures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the space ahead of her was clear. Tristan stopped right in front of Eliana, disregarding the curious stares around them, and said, &#34;Did I keep you waiting? I ran into someone unpleasant and missed your message.Took me a couple of minutes to get here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his voice carried over the crowd, the buzzing chatter died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes widened across the crowd as realization sank in -the person he had come to greet was Eliana!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some blinked hard, even rubbed their eyes,convinced they were mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet the truth was undeniable. Tristan, whose expression was usually cool and unreadable, was looking at her with unmistakable warmth and a smile that broke his usual composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when had he ever smiled like that? The answer was never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, I only just got here. We should get going.&#34;Eliana had already felt the weight of people&#39;s eyes before he appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he showed up, it was as though every eye in the place had latched onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no interest in being paraded like some curiosity, so she kept it brief and started walking inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the onlookers, it appeared as though she remained completely unaffected by Tristan&#39;s presence.</p>
