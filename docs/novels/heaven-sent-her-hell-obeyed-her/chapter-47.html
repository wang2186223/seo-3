                <p>The once-still halls of the Murray estate now buzzed with movement and chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many of the servants who had been dismissed in the family&#39;s darker days had returned of their own accord,a silent testament to how well they had once been treated in this household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the bustle of activity didn&#39;t match the turnout-few actual guests had made an appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps sensing the possibility of Eliana&#39;s spirits dipping, Damon, Sawyer, and Carl each stepped forward with gifts in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Damon came a striking painting-one he had purchased for a steep sum back before the Murray fortune crumbled. The massive piece, stretching three meters across, had once claimed pride of place on the wall of his bedroom, a sign of how much it meant to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer&#39;s offering wasn&#39;t of high monetary value, but its worth was in the hours of care behind it-a towering three-tier cake he had labored over through the night. Its beauty drew a low murmur of admiration from those who saw it. Every swirl of frosting and every delicate sugar detail spoke of the effort he had poured into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s turn came with a promise fulfilled-he handed over the signed transfer contract for the plot of land he had pledged to her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth bloomed quietly in Eliana&#39;s chest. Whether or not anyone else came today hardly mattered; solitude had been her companion for years. Still, there had been times when watching others reunite with loved ones had left her feeling a quiet ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she stood among people she could call her own-and who claimed her as theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment settled over her like sunlight-until Jordy burst through the doorway holding a small jewelry box. &#34;This just arrived. The sender said it&#39;s from Sean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s hand hovered, expression tightening, though she made no move to take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl,curiosity already getting the better of him, flipped the lid open. flipped the lid open. Inside lay a necklace, its centerpiece a flame-shaped pendant cut from rich red ruby, framed with glittering diamonds that caught the light in a sharp, dazzling blaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s stunning. Lia, it&#39;d look incredible on you. Who&#39;d have guessed Sean could be this... thoughtful?&#34;Carl remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t answer. Instead, she handed the matter off, asking Ashley to put away the gifts for safekeeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Stella stepped forward with something of her own to present. It was unlike the others-a charity foundation dedicated to reuniting abducted children with their families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking softly, she told Eliana, &#34;We created this three months after you disappeared. Your father and I wanted to give hope to parents searching for their children. Now, I&#39;m placing it in your hands. It has fifty million in funding and a team of dozens ready to follow your lead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name on the contract caught Eliana off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angel Children Foundation...&#34;she murmured under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name was one she knew well. Over the years, the organization had restored countless children to their families-some from households of great influence and means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this in her hands, she understood that if a day came when she needed help, those families would stand beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>t was clear Stella had thought far ahead, making sure Eliana would never face trouble without resources.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Thank you, Mom..&#34; The words came from a place deep in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glad you like it,&#34; Stella replied, her smile warm and certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>different image surfaced in Eliana&#39;s mind-Janessa, who had once used her and even sold her without a econd thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he villagers&#39; old saying echoed in her memory, the one they repeated whenurging her to stay in the ountryside and marry Neal: &#34;Life is the same, no matter who you&#39;re with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew now those words were a lie. Life could change entirely, depending on the hands that held you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Murray...&#34; Two guests stepped forward with polite smiles, saying, &#34;We&#39;ve already delivered our gifts,and since there are other matters we must attend to, we&#39;ll be taking our leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly ah hour had crawled by, and aside from those two, the only people who remained were a handful of steadfast senior executives from the Murray Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They barely filled a single table, and the aif around them felt restless, uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The departing guests feared that the longer they stayed, the more they&#39;d be lumped in with the Murray family-an association Qidence&#39;s high society would surely mock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both already regretted walking through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing her lips into a polite curve, Stellareplied, &#34;I appreciate you making time in your busy schedules.If you have pressing business, please don&#39;t let me keep you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Goodbye.&#34; Relief flickered across their faces, and they turned to leave-only for movement at the entrance to halt them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes followed the movement until the figure stepped fully inside. It was Leyla, the very woman who had so publicly severed ties with them not long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two guests exchanged a quick glance, sensing the scent of scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had heard the story-Leyla&#39;s dramatic break from the Murrays, Stella collapsing from anger, and Carl making sure the whole affair became public knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had despised Leyla&#39;s betrayal and wanted the world to see her for what she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even he hadn&#39;t expected her to show her face here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests who had been ready to go now lingered, curiosity holding them in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Stella&#39;s voice was cool, stripped of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,she had treated Leyla as if she were her own flesh and blood, lavishing her with affection That ended the day Leyla revealed herself to be ungrateful-and Stella had no desire to welcome her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla strode in with an easy smile, her tone smooth. &#34;I&#39;m here for the welcome-home party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept over the nearly empty hall, and the glint in her eyes carried more than a trace of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not wanted here. Leave at once.&#34; Carl&#39;s tone cut through the air without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl, you&#39;re certain you want me gone?&#34; Her finger swept toward the empty rows of chairs.&#34;With so few guests here, tossing me out will make this place feel like a tomb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s tone stayed flat, her expression unchanging. &#34;Noise levels don&#39;t concern you. Say what you actually came for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reason for showing up had nothing to do with trading insults alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance to Stella, she cut straight in. &#34;When I turned eighteen, Dad gifted me the estate and signed it into my name. I&#39;m here to take back what&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes narrowed to slits before she snapped, &#34;You cut all ties with the family. This estate has no connection to you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh slid from Leyla&#39;s lips. &#34;You don&#39;t get to decide that. Dad legally transferred it to me with a contract. If you&#39;d rather avoid a court battle, bring me the deed now. If not, I&#39;ll win it back through legal means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU-&#34;Stella was about to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana stepped forward, placing herself in front of Stella. &#34;The transfer happened, yes. But you mortgaged the property to the court, and we bought it back. That makes it ours now. Even if you appeal, the ruling won&#39;t change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure faltered, and she shot Eliana a look as sharp as glass. How could she possibly know about the mortgage? The thought dug into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock was written plainly on Damon, Sawyer, and Carl&#39;s faces. Carl spoke up first, &#34;So the reason those people came to claim the estate was because you pawned it off to the court? Leyla, how could you be so cold? Do you even realize that without Eliana, we&#39;d be left to live on the street?&#34;</p>
