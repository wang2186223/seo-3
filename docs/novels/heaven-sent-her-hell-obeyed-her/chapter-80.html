                <p>Leyla had pampered her skin for years with religious devotion, cultivating a delicate, rose-tinted complexion that caught the light like polished porcelain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The violent crack of her palm against her own flesh left an immediate crimson handprint blazing across her pale cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyebrows drew together in disgust at the pathetic display. &#34;What kind of sick performance is this? Do you enjoy hurting yourself? If so, take your twisted theatrics home where they belong. This is revolting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A triumphant laugh bubbled from Leyla&#39;s throat.&#34;What are you even talking about? You&#39;re obviously the one who struck me! Soon everyone will discover your true nature-a violent, unstable woman with a vicious temper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom how Tristan and Hector could possibly like someone so dangerously unpredictable over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Leyla opened her mouth to scream,  Eliana&#39;s hand moved like lightning, producing a gleaming silver needle that she drove into a precise pressure point on Leyla&#39;s neck with surgical precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The needle disappeared as swiftly as it had appeared,leaving barely a trace of its presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pinch flared across Leyla&#39;s neck, and when she attempted to voice her outrage, only silence emerged from her throat. Her eyes flew wide with terror and confusion as she stared at Eliana, her expression screaming desperate questions about what dark magic had rendered her mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The connection between that tiny prick on her neck and her sudden inability to speak defied all logic and reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile spread across Eliana&#39;s lips as she delivered her explanation with clinical detachment.&#34;Don&#39;t panic. I simply found your screeching unbearable and employed a basic acupuncture technique to grant us all some peace. Your voice will return in under ten minutes. However, before you attempt your little victim charade, I suggest you examine the ceiling and count exactly how many surveillance cameras are recording your pathetic performance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having delivered her cutting remarks, Eliana dismissed Leyla with a contemptuous push and strode away with regal composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have easily remnained to watch Leyla summon witnesses, then wielded the surveillance footage like a weapon to destroy this stupid woman&#39;s reputation publicly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Leyla simply wasn&#39;t significant enough to warrant such elaborate revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never viewed Leyla as anything more than a minor irritation undeserving of serious attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These childish manipulations were old tricks that Eliana had encountered countless times before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting energy on such a trivial adversary held no appeal for someone of Eliana&#39;s caliber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eliana&#39;s figure receded, Leyla&#39;s first instinct screamed at her to give chase. But Eliana&#39;s warning echoed in her mind, forcing her head to snap upward toward the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expansive exhibition space bristled with surveillance cameras like electronic sentinels watching every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face transformed in an instant, color draining away as her thoughts spun wildly through the implications. Of course-with priceless masterpieces adorning these walls, comprehensive surveillance  would be absolutely essential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The devastating realization crashed over her like a cold wave-Eliana had penetrated her scheme from the very beginning but hadn&#39;t considered it worth acknowledging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s fingers found the tiny puncture wound on her neck, and a cocktail of rage and bone-deep fear coursed through her veins like ice water. For the first time,the terrifying possibility that she was completely outmatched by Eliana settled into her consciousness like a lead weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The acknowledgment of her own inadequacy filled her with such profound dread that her hands began to shake with barely contained terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strategic thinking gradually replaced her panic as she recognized the brutal truth-facing Eliana alone would be suicide. She desperately needed powerful allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before seeking reinforcements, however, she had to secure the foundation she already possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector remained her sole remaining asset, and she had to bind his devotion to her with unbreakable chains.Losing him would leave her with absolutely nothing-no power, no protection, no future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This sobering reality redirected her priorities completely, sending her away from any thoughts of  pursuing Eliana and toward the resting area where Hector waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory in the competition would surely transform Jeffry&#39;s perception of her worth, and marriage to Hector would provide the wealth and influence necessary to wage war against Eliana on equal terms</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eliana had positioned herself at the conference area&#39;s exit, patiently awaiting Carl&#39;s emergence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady stream of contestants had completed their work and was flowing out through the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word had spread among them like wildfire-Eliana was the legendary painter Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they spotted her, their faces transformed with star-struck excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley, would you honor me with your autograph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We witnessed that earlier incident. Please don&#39;t lower yourself to engage with such a pathetic creature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely right. Someone of your extraordinary caliber could preside as head judge over international art competitions-this local event is beneath your talents.&#34; The admiring contestants unleashed a torrent of praise that Eliana couldn&#39;t stem quickly enough-Carl had already absorbed every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Eliana with complete bewilderment written across his features. &#34;Lia, what&#39;s happening here?Why are they addressing you as Riley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discomfort settled over Eliana like an ill-fitting cloak.Her multiple personas had remained carefully hidden from the Murray family through deliberate deception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janessa&#39;s brutal betrayals had forged her heart into steel, making her incapable of extending trust easily -even to those who shared her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prospect of enduring another devastating betrayal was simply too dangerous to risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, she had buried her impressive accomplishments beneath the humble facade of a simple country girl surviving on agricultural labor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet as genuine affection blossomed between her and the Murray family, she began to understand that certain secrets had outlived their protective purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every Murray except Sean had proven themselves deserving of her confidence, particularly Carl, whose unwavering loyalty had earned him a special place in her guarded heart. &#34;Carl, take a deep breath. I&#39;ll walk you through everything,&#34; Eliana promised with gentle firmness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had graciously acknowledged her admirers,she guided Carl away to a secluded corner where they could speak privately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, are you truly the famous painter Riley?&#34; Carl&#39;s question burst forth with barely contained excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s head moved in confirmation. &#34;Yes,I am Riley.I owe you a sincere apology. Carl. I&#39;ve been concealing this truth from you and weaving lies to protect it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame colored her cheeks as her words faded into uncomfortable silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened next caught her completely off guard -Carl swept her into an enthusiastic embrace.&#34;You&#39;ve made me so incredibly proud! I&#39;m one of your devoted admirers too! Your paintings speak to my soul! Lia, my respect for you has reached new heights.You can repair vehicles, heal the sick, and create masterpieces! You&#39;re absolutely phenomenal! From this moment forward, you&#39;re my ultimate inspiration and idol!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s explosive joy took Eliana completely by surprise.She had braced herself for his hurt and anger over her prolonged deception. Even without outright fury, she had anticipated seeing pain in his eyes, considering how he had always offered her nothing but genuine honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Carl appeared to harbor absolutely no resentment or wounded feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a gentle poke, her voice filled wvith amazement.&#34;Carl, doesn&#39;t this make you angry at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion painted Carl&#39;s features. &#34;Why would I feel angry? You&#39;re the most extraordinary person I know I&#39;m absolutely ecstatic, not upset in the slightest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I deliberately misled you, spinning stories about how I can get a work of Riley...&#34; Eliana&#39;s explanation carried the weight of her guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s bewilderment deepened into pure joy. &#34;But if you&#39;re Riley, that means I can request original artwork directly from the source! How could I possibly be unhappy about that? This is the most wonderful revelation imaginable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana found herself rendered speechless by his boundless enthusiasm. The realization struck her powerfully-Carl possessed a genuinely pure and generous spirit that defied conventional expectations.Within his worldview, harboring resentment toward her appeared to be an impossibility. Apparently, no action of hers could diminish his capacity for  understanding and acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This profound recognition sent waves of deep emotion coursing through Eliana&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Carl remained lost in his euphoric state, Eliana suddenly seized his sleeve with urgent fingers,&#34;Carl,since you&#39;ve taken this revelation so well,let me share something that might actually provoke your anger,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s expression shifted to complete bewilderment,marveling at how even Eliana&#39;s cryptic statements somehow enhanced his admiration for her mysterious complexity.</p>
