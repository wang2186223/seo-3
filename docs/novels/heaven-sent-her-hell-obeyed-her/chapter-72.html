                <p>In the blink of an eye, every trace of grievance, fear,and unease on Eliana&#39;s face melted away, leaving behind the cool, composed expression she wore so naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doran, too honest to mask his reaction, blinked in shock and blurted out, &#34;Wait, were you acting this whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of hesitation,Eliana replied,&#34;Yes.Every bit of it was an act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ve got to hand it to you-your acting&#39;s first-rate.&#34; Doran fumbled for words, needing a moment before that line finally came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That remark made Eliana lift a brow in mild surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what she&#39;d seen, she&#39;d assumed everyone working under Tristan was shrewd and calculating.Doran,however,seemed built of simpler stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say more, the door swung open and Tristan stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression revealed nothing,his voice even as he  said, &#34;Doran, you can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Doran replied quickly, slipping out and pulling the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Rocco on guard outside, Doran grabbed his arm and whispered urgently, &#34;You won&#39;t believe this -Ms. Murray was pretending just now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re only figuring that out now?&#34; Rocco&#39;s reply was flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on...&#34; Doran scratched at his head. &#34;You knew the whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco gave a slow nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of frustration hit Doran. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m the only one who didn&#39;t catch on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another calm nod from Rocco, followed by a firm pat on Doran&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Relax. I&#39;ll set you up with an appointment at the top brain clinic in Qidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Doran asked, his brows knitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a wild guess.&#34; Rocco&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Doran a long moment to piece it together,only to realize Rocco was calling him dense enough to  actually need that brain check-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult lit a spark of defiance in him, and for a second, he considered throwing down a challenge right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut it out before Mr. Pearson hears us. I&#39;m not about to disturb whatever&#39;s going on inside,&#34; Rocco murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warning was enough to make Doranswallow his pride,though the sting of humiliation lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, another thought crept in. He frowned and asked, &#34;Be honest, Rocco-don&#39;t you think Ms.Murray is a little too scheming? Can we really trust her around Mr.Pearson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco didn&#39;t even hesitate. &#34;Why not? He can read people better than anyone. If anything, a woman with brains suits him far more than a foolish one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing his lips into a thin line, Doran muttered, &#34;If we&#39;re talking about that, then I&#39;d say Colleen is also-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop. Don&#39;t bring her up, especially when Ms.Murray&#39;s around,&#34; Rocco said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to worry about? It&#39;s not like she can hear us... and I do think Colleen&#39;s amazing too,&#34; Doran insisted. One sharp look from Rocco was all it took for him to clamp his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the room, the door had barely closed before Tristan got straight to business. &#34;The issue you asked me to handle is resolved. Rupert&#39;s agreed to step away from the case entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana took it in without surprise. She&#39;d always known he was perceptive enough to catch her meaning without needing to spell it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see your hand,&#34; Tristan said suddenly,his voice leaving little room for refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting both hands in mild confusion, Eliana asked,&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, he reached for her left hand,turning it over in his grasp as if searching for something specific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together. &#34;What exactly are you checking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were splashed with coffee, weren&#39;t you?&#34; Tristan asked. The question caught Eliana off guard.&#34;Wait-you didn&#39;t realize I was faking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even so, the coffee still hit your skin,&#34; Tristan replied,unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t boiling-barely warm, really,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored the explanation, his eyes scanning her hand with meticulous care. Only after making sure there was no sign of injury did he finally release her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time you pull something like that, make sure it doesn&#39;t actually put you in harm&#39;s way. Got it?&#34; His voice carried an unshakable sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seriousness in his expression unsettled Eliana more than she cared to admit. She cleared her throat lightly and said, &#34;Alright, I get it... But tell me, will this whole situation end up causing trouble for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;And which situation do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mayor Oliver backed down from my father&#39;s case,but I&#39;m worried he&#39;ll come after you the first chance he gets,&#34; Eliana explained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at her intently, the anticipation in his eyes evident. &#34;So, you&#39;re concerned about me?&#34; he asked. &#34;Naturally. I don&#39;t like dragging other people into my mess,&#34; Eliana replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer didn&#39;t seem to satisfy him. &#34;If I cared about being dragged in, I never would&#39;ve played along in the first place,&#34; he said with an easy shrug. &#34;Right now, you should be more focused on yourself. Thanks to me, you&#39;ve got Celine gunning for you, and she&#39;s not the forgiving type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m the sort who worries about payback?&#34;Eliana replied with an easy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his lips. &#34;Exactly. Neither of us scares easily, so there&#39;s no need for either of us to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better remember you said that. If things get messy for you, you can&#39;t pin it on me,&#34; Eliana replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t blame you-no matter how things turn out,&#34;he said with quiet certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his tone struck her as oddly off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, she asked, &#34;You only brought me here as your date to keep Celine at bay, right? Now that you&#39;ve done that, can I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leaving already? I thought you still had another  performance lined up,&#34; Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brows knit in confusion. &#34;Performance? What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On my way here, Rocco told me Carl was spotted at the entrance,&#34; Tristan explained. &#34;I assume you&#39;re the one who called him over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reminder hit her like a jolt-Eliana had almost forgotten her original goal of digging into what Leyla had been doing in Carl&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Tristan hadn&#39;t brought it up, she might have forgotten entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Carl still waiting outside?&#34; she asked quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had someone take him to the conference area,&#34;Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll go see him,&#34; Eliana said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me come with you,&#34; Tristan suggested immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to. You&#39;ve got your own affairs to handle,&#34; Eliana rejected, moving to the door and slipping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside, Rocco gave Tristan a questioning glance,silently asking if he should shadow her. A small shake of Tristan&#39;s head gave his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eliana didn&#39;t want him following her, he had no intention of forcing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt certain that with her about to make her move,the entertainment was only moments away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over in the main exhibition hall, Leyla had been lingering expectantly for Hector, though he was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she began to suspect he might skip the event entirely, his figure emerged from the direction of the conference area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a pristine white tailcoat, Hector carried himself like a man born to refinement, hispresence drawing more than a few admiring glances from nearby women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An instinctive unease settled over Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he could never rival Tristan in her mind, Hector still far outshone the typical rich young man. A man like him-handsome,well-connected,and wealthy-was a prize few would ignore, and she had no intention of letting another woman get to him first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced precision, she smoothed her hair,double-checked her makeup, and swept toward him. At that moment, Hector was speaking into his phone,recounting to Jeffry what had taken place in the private room earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s tone sharpened with surprise. &#34;Eliana Murray again? And what exactly is she to Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said she&#39;s his fiancée,&#34; Hector answered flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fiancée?&#34; Jeffry repeated, startled. &#34;It&#39;s lucky we made it clear to the Murray family that day-that there&#39;s no enmity between us anymore. Otherwise,this would&#39;ve been a real mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector kept his response to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dislike for the Murray family-especially Eliana-ran deep, and it all stemmed from Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry continued, &#34;From now on, keep your distance from Leyla. The Murrays aren&#39;t exactly fond of her these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34;Hector began, but his words faltered the instant he spotted Leyla heading his way from across the room.</p>
