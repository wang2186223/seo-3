                <p>Eliana&#39;s brows drew together as she met the eyes of Jeffry and Ruby, who had hurried ahead of the rest.Her voice stayed steady. &#34;What is it you want with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple shared a quick glance before Jeffry stepped forward. &#34;May I confirm-are you Ms.Murray, daughter of Louis and Stella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; If she intended to remain with the Murray family, she would have to grow accustomed to her new identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla arrived just then. The moment she heard Eliana&#39;s answer, she turned to Jeffry without hesitation. &#34;Mr. Clarke, you heard her. She&#39;s the woman the Murray couple picked up from the countryside. There&#39;s no way she&#39;s some miracle doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s gaze shifted back to Eliana, uncertain. &#34;So... you&#39;re from the countryside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like that,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another wordless exchange passed between Jeffry and Ruby, both wondering if they&#39;d made a mistake.Someone from the countryside-how likely was it she could be the renowned doctor from Eighvale?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s chest swelled with satisfaction. She was certain she hadn&#39;t misjudged the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze cut to Eliana. &#34;This is Mr. and Mrs. Clarke.Watch your mouth in front of them. Pretending to be someone you&#39;re not will only make you a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker passed through Eliana&#39;s eyes as the pieces fell into place-so this was why the Clarke couple had come. She had never intended to cross paths wvith the Clarke family again. There were plenty of other ways to raise the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s name; she didn&#39;t need their business. They had already cast her aside,so the patient was no longer her concern. But if Leyla was so eager to embarrass her, she was more than willing to humor her. Without sparing Leyla a glance, Eliana looked straight at Jeffry and Ruby. &#34;Are you the ones who placed an order through the Onyx Syndicate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onyx Syndicate? The very mention sent a jolt through the couple. The miracle doctor they&#39;d sought had been contacted through that channel-a detail only they knew. The organization operated outside official channels, and as deputy mayor of Qidence, Jeffry and Ruby had every reason to keep that connection buried. Which meant... if she knew,she could only be one person. Their eyes widened,disbelief flashing across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s voice shook. &#34;You... you&#39;re the miracle doctor the Onyx Syndicate sent us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brows lifted, a quiet air of authority settling over her. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying!&#34; Leyla snapped, jabbing a finger toward Eliana&#39;s face. &#34;Are you deaf? Did you not hear a word I just said? If you have any shred of sense,stop parading around as some miracle doctor!&#34; &#34;Leyla!&#34; Ruby&#39;s brows drew together, her tone clipped as she interjected, &#34;I&#39;m speaking with Ms.Murray.You have no place interrupting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the woman before them truly was the miracle doctor, Leyla&#39;s outburst could cost her dearly. Stories had spread through Eighvale of that doctor curing the most untouchable figures in society-and the Clarke family had pulled every string they had just to get the Onyx Syndicate to take their case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face shifted, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. &#34;Mrs. Clarke, I&#39;m only worried you&#39;ll fall for her act...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had heard enough. Without a word, she drew a small card from her pocket and handed it to Ruby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby looked at it-and her composure fractured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her hand was an order acceptance card from Onyx Syndicate. For medical cases, the card was always white, embossed wvith their signature emblem: a blood-red rose in full bloom. &#34;You are the doctor we are looking for!&#34; Jeffry&#39;s eyes locked on the card, and his voice burst with excitement. &#34;You&#39;re Miss Miracle Doctor! Please-come with us and treat my father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression didn&#39;t shift, as though their sudden change in tone had been inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was cool and detached. &#34;Your butler told me to &#39;get lost.&#39; I was just about to follow his advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both Jeffry and Ruby glaring daggers at him, he stumbled over his defense. &#34;No, Mr. Clarke, Mrs.Clarke-it wasn&#39;t me! It was Leyla! She&#39;s the one who said Ms. Murray couldn&#39;t possibly be the miracle doctor,sol-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wham-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s foot slammed into his shin, and Terry doubled over, clutching his leg with a hiss of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just swallow whatever anyone tells you? I told you to wait for the miracle doctor at the gate-this is how you &#39;wait&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby&#39;s words were even harsher. &#34;Pack your things and get out. The Clarke family has no use for someone so brainless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... Mr. Clarke, Mrs. Clarke, you have to believe me -it wasn&#39;t my fault. Leyla misled me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s hands balled into tight fists. &#34;Mr. Clarke, Mrs.Clarke, I&#39;m telling you the truth. She&#39;s lying to you.There&#39;s no way she&#39;s the miracle doctor. It&#39;s completely impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby lifted the white card stamped with the crimson rose. &#34;Do you even recognize this? It&#39;s the one and only card used to reach the miracle doctor. No one outside of her could possibly have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes flickered toward the card despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no clue what the Onyx Syndicate was or what that card represented. All she knew was that Eliana carried a messy past. The idea that someone like Eliana could be a miracle doctor was something she refused to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to believe me-I&#39;m telling the truth-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; Jeffry&#39;s voice crackedI like a whip.&#34;Get her out of my sight! And tell the gate security she&#39;s never to set foot here again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; Two bodyguards stepped forward without hesitation, each gripping one of Leyla&#39;s arms and hauling her away as if she weighed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry was seized next and escorted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment on, he was just another ordinary man-stripped of the title of the Clarke family&#39;s butler. Regret gnawed at him, and he clung to one desperate hope: that Leyla was right, and Eliana truly was a fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the two were gone, Jeffry and Ruby turned back, their expressions instantly melting into warm,deferential smiles. &#34;Ms. Murray-no, Dr. Murray,&#34;Jeffry said smoothly, &#34;you heard what happened. It was all a misunderstanding. We truly didn&#39;t know you&#39;d arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby nodded eagerly. &#34;That&#39;s right. Doctor, you&#39;ll always be welcome here. Come by anytime-no one will dare stop you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From down the hall, Leyla-still being hauled away-twisted in the guards&#39; grip and shouted, her voice shrill with defiance. &#34;You&#39;re making a huge mistake!She&#39;s fooling you two!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s brow furrowed in irritation. A sharp gesture from him sent the bodyguards dragging her faster until her voice and figure vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, he turned back. &#34;Doctor, please understand-our butler Terry is old, and his judgment isn&#39;t what it used to be. Don&#39;t hold it against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved in a pleasant smile, but her tone landed like a blade. &#34;Unfortunately for him, I make a habit of holding grudges. Bye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to walk away. The Clarke couple scrambled to follow. &#34;Wait-please don&#39;t take it to heart. This is entirely our fault. Name your consultation fee, whatever the amount-we&#39;ll pay it. Or if there&#39;s anything else you want, as long as it&#39;s within our power, we&#39;ll make it happen.&#34;</p>
