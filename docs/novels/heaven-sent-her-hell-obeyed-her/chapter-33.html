                <p>Rocco hesitated before asking, his tone tinged with curiosity, &#34;That young lady just now-was she the famous doctor who saved Mr. Clarke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a small nod. &#34;She is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect her to be so young... but there&#39;s something about her. I could swear l&#39;ve seen her before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes slid toward him. &#34;You&#39;ve felt that too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan offered no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, the corrupted video would be repaired.And when that moment came, one glance would be all it took to know the truth. Pressed for time, he&#39;d left for the event without even catching her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Tristan&#39;s silence, Rocco kept his thoughts to himself and focused on weaving the car smoothly through the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Carl appeared,striding toward Eliana.&#34;Eliana, are you hurt? I heard police sirens blaring and couldn&#39;t spot you at Entrance One, so l camne running.&#34; His gaze brimmed with genuine worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the frost in Eliana&#39;s expression eased. &#34;I&#39;m fine.I heard them too and came over to see what was happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Carl&#39;s face as he finally let out a slow breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he&#39;d returned from picking out the bag and couldn&#39;t find Eliana, icy dread had gripped him. The thought of losing his sister a second time nearly robbed him of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief only came when he saw her unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,where&#39;s Sean?&#34; Eliana asked casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Carl thought of Sean. His brow creased in surprise. &#34;Now that you mention it, I haven&#39;t seen him since we split up. No idea what he&#39;s doing. He swore he&#39;d stick with you while you shopped ...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Sean had been by her side or not didn&#39;t matter to Eliana. A man with no place for her in his heart had no place in her thoughts either. &#34;Maybe something urgent blindsided him at the very last second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if that&#39;s true, he could&#39;ve given us a heads-up. What&#39;s going on with him? You know what-forget wondering, I&#39;m calling.&#34; He yanked his phone from his pocket, thumb flying over the screen. Sean&#39;s phone was switched off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana glanced at him. &#34;Couldn&#39;t get through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... Don&#39;t read too much into it. That&#39;s just his style-shows up, then disappears. It&#39;s not about you;he&#39;s probably got his hands full.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice stayed steady. &#34;In that case, let&#39;s head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still haven&#39;t had a look at the bag I picked out for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take a look once we&#39;re home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll pull the car around.&#34; Carl hurried off,returning a short while later with the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eliana reached for the door handle, her gaze caught Niko across the street, standing with several men and giving her a subtle wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a faint nod before sliding into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts wandered, turning over the question of what business the Vulture Brotherhood had in Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Onyx Syndicate, despite its formidable reach, had always steered clear of illegal ventures. Their suppression in Eighvale had been the result of stepping on the wrong interests-not breaking the law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Vulture Brotherhood, however... She figured she&#39;d have to carve out time soon for a frank conversation with Leroy. If they were going to go far,the money fueling their journey needed to be earned honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s car roared down the road, and before long, they arrived home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before stepping into the living room, both Carl and Eliana caught the murmur of voices drifting out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there someone here? The earlier incident with the Vulture Brotherhood demanding the estate still weighed heavily on them, quickening their pace toward the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing into the foyer, they found a man assisting another seated in a wheelchair. Both were strikingly good-looking, and on closer inspection, shared features with Carl-though each looked a little worn around the edges. Were these two possibly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon! Sawyer!&#34; Carl&#39;s voice broke into a startled cry,sealing the truth Eliana had just suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men turned at once, and the moment their gazes landed on Eliana, their expressions softened into radiant, almost disbelieving joy. &#34;Lia... is that really you?&#34; the man in the wheelchair asked first, his voice trembling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears glistening in her eyes, Stella stepped forward and introduced them. &#34;Eliana, this is Damon -your eldest brother-and this is your second brother,Sawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one seated in the wheelchair, his posture dignified despite his frailty, was none other than Damon Murray.Sawyer Murray, her second brother, was the one pushing the wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana felt little more than a faint ripple of recognition.Too many years had passed, and she had been far too young back then to truly remember these brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, detached nod, she greeted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana.&#34; Damon&#39;s voice shook as he reached out a trembling hand toward her. The sudden shift of his weight made the wheelchair tip precariously to one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon!&#34; The startled cry went up as everyone scrambled to grab the wheelchair before it tipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana moved first, steadying Damon with a firm grip just in time. &#34;You okay?&#34; she asked, her voice low with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering about himself, Damon&#39;s gaze swept over her in worry. &#34;You didn&#39;t get hurt, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected tenderness in his tone made her chest tighten. She gave a small shake of her head. &#34;I&#39;m fine.What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint flush of shame crossed his face as he murmured, &#34;I&#39;m alright... I&#39;m sorry I scared you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Carl and Sawyer let out the breath they&#39;d been holding. One of them guided Damon back into the wheelchair, while the other gripped the handles firmly, making sure it stayed steady this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze lingered on Damon&#39;s motionless legs,a faint furrow forming between her brows, before she turned toward Stella. &#34;Is his condition something that might heal... or is it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella brushed away the fresh streak of tears on her cheeks, her voice breaking as she admitted, &#34;It&#39;s permanent... Two years ago, he suffered a terrible injury, and since then, his legs have never recovered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heaviness in her tone hinted at a story left untold,planting a quiet unease in Eliana&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,with Stella offering no more, she swallowed her questions. After Stella and Sawyer wheeled Damon back to his room,Eliana shifted her attention to Carl. &#34;Tell me the truth-what happened to Damon&#39;s legs? Why can&#39;t he walk again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl glanced around, then leaned in so only she could hear.His voice was low and grim. &#34;It was Brenda White.She&#39;s the one who destroyed him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brenda White?&#34; The name stirred a faint memory,though Eliana couldn&#39;t quite place it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl leaned closer, lowering his voice. &#34;She was Damon&#39;s fiancée. That day, she insisted on trying horseback riding. The horse panicked... Damon ran in to pull her out of danger-and paid the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone grew heavier as he added, &#34;We never blamed her. Damon made his own choice to save her. But once it became clear his legs wouldn&#39;t recover, she started avoiding us. I even saw her on another man&#39;s arm not long ago. We&#39;re not saying she has to marry him... but refusing to even see him?&#34; He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon risked everything to save her, yet she&#39;s never even offered him a word of thanks. And her family?After the disaster, they didn&#39;t bother with so much as a single phone call. You probably don&#39;t know this,but Damon was once the pride of our family-a prodigy from the start. He even won first place in an elite  international hacker competition. But after losing in love and the use of his legs, he&#39;s been sinking deeper into despair. There were times... he even tried to take his own life. Every bit of it traces back to Brenda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice rose with each word, fury sharpening every syllable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the reason Brenda&#39;s name had sounded so familiar finally clicked for Eliana.</p>
