                <p>Davin approached Eliana with an eager gleam in his eyes. &#34;Younng lady, you&#39;re absolutely right. I&#39;ve felt something was off about my recent works, but l couldn&#39;t put my finger on it. Could you tell me how to avoid this in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a small, knowing smile. &#34;The problem isn&#39;t in the mountains, or the flowing water, or the mist. It&#39;s that you&#39;ve started wanting too much. That hunger has dulled the very thing that made your work extraordinary-its essence. That&#39;s why your paintings feel...expressive lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Davin was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Riley once telling him that the essence of his works was his greatest strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, hearing Eliana say the same-and point out it was gone-everything clicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Mr. Gordon, your paintings have always been expressive!&#34; Frieda&#39;s voice cut in sharply. &#34;Don&#39;t let a few words from her shake your confidence. We all know your work&#39;s value. Trust yourself.&#34; She&#39;d seen Davin&#39;s expression change and panicked. If he started taking Eliana seriously, it would make Frieda look like an ignorant fool-especially after she&#39;d just called Eliana a country bumpkin who didn&#39;t understand art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Eliana&#39;s opinion stick with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Davin&#39;s tone was firm. &#34;I&#39;m not doubting myself because of her. I&#39;ve felt something was wrong for a while now. She simply helped me see it clearly.Please step aside-I need to thank this young lady properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, don&#39;t listen to her.&#34; Frieda blocked him outright,desperation flashing across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Davin thanked Eliana in front of everyone, Frieda would never live it down. Everyone would think she was the one who didn&#39;t understand art. She couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Eliana, voice edged with challenge.&#34;If you&#39;re so skilled at painting that even Mr. Gordon&#39;s work doesn&#39;t impress you, then why haven&#39;t I ever heard of you in the art world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had been calmly studying Davin&#39;s painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she turned toward Frieda with a look of amusement and mild mockery. &#34;Who says I&#39;m not in the art world?&#34; The change in angle revealed her petite, delicate features. Davin&#39;s eyes widened-bright and alive again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition hit him. He knew her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His beard quivered, but for a moment, he couldn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda didn&#39;t notice his reaction. She laughed, smug and dismissive. &#34;Eliana, you&#39;re delusional. My family collects masterpieces from renowned artists. If you had any reputation in the art world, I would have heard of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda was certain that she had never heard of Eliana&#39;s name in the art world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not surprising you haven&#39;t,&#34; Eliana said evenly.&#34;I don&#39;t paint under my real name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s brow arched. &#34;Oh? Then what name do you use?&#34; she scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley,&#34; Eliana replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name dropped like a stone in still water-instantly sending ripples through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley? The legendary painter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s actually Riley? No wonder her critique made sense to Mr. Gordon.&#34; &#34;Oh my God... we&#39;re actually meeting Riley? This trip was absolutely worth it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even those who weren&#39;t Davin&#39;s fans surged closer at the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley? Is Riley really here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick! Let me see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they were not all Davin&#39;s fans, they all adored Riley. Riley&#39;s work was unmatched in this era, but she was famously elusive-rarely releasing paintings and never appearing in public. They all wanted to catch a glimpse of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco,standing nearby, stared at Eliana in shock. He knew the name well. Tristan admired Riley more than any other artist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan went out of his way to buy all the paintings Riley released on the market, paying above market price. And it turned out, Riley was Eliana?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s expression shifted with mixed emotions,but his gaze on Eliana didn&#39;t waver. He&#39;d once thought she wasn&#39;t good enough for Tristan, but since Tristan didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d kept his mouth shut. After all, what mattered most was Tristan&#39;s taste, not his own. But now, his opinion had taken a complete turn. Eliana wasn&#39;t just a skilled doctor-she was also gifted with a paintbrush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discovery left him itching to run straight to Tristan with the intriguing news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the way, Frieda&#39;s face darkened as she watched everyone buying into Eliana&#39;s words and rushing over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands curled into fists, and at last, she snapped,her voice ringing out, &#34;Everyone, calm down! Don&#39;t let her fool you! There&#39;s no way she&#39;s Riley!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her outburst doused the crowd&#39;s excitement like a bucket of cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the onlookers as doubt crept back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone finally asked outright, &#34;You&#39;re saying you&#39;re Riley-do you have any proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; another chimed in, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen Riley in person, but I&#39;ve heard in the art scene that Riley&#39;s a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right! And I heard Riley&#39;s quite old. You&#39;re young, and a woman... why should we believe you?&#34; others echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frieda&#39;s lips curled in triumph. At last, people were thinking straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Eliana on a few words alone would have been downright foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was glad there were still some sensible heads in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, spearheading the attack.&#34;You claim you&#39;re Riley? Then prove it! If you can&#39;t, I should call the police right now and have you arrested for impersonation and attempted fraud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No point talking to her,&#34; someone added. &#34;Riley&#39;s paintings are priceless. She&#39;s obviously trying to scam us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the police! Have her arrested!&#34; another voice joined in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people immediately pulled out their phones,ready to call the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others closed in around Eliana, forming a tight ring to block any chance of escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan arrived. He&#39;d come to see what the fuss was about, with Doran close behind. The last thing he expected was to find Eliana at the center of the uproar-surrounded, shouted at, and accused from every direction.</p>
