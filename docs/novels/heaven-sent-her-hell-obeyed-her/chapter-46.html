                <p>A beat later, Stella slapped the invitation from Addie&#39;s grasp, her eyes narrowing with contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wvant Damon there just so your White family can parade around pretending you&#39;re not ungrateful,&#34; she said with a cold, mocking laugh. &#34;Forget it. Everyone&#39;s going to see exactly what kind of people your family really are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie&#39;s gaze sharpened into a challenge. &#34;You might want to think twice. If Damon doesn&#39;t attend, your family will find itself cut off from every circle that matters. And as for when your husband can walk free again...&#34; She let the pause hang, her voice dripping with veiled menace. &#34;That could take a very long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella didn&#39;t flinch. Not even a hint of doubt flickered across her face. &#34;Our family&#39;s affairs are ours to handle-your White family doesn&#39;t need to meddle. You&#39;d do better to mind your own steps. One wrong move, and trouble might find you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that warning, she swept out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana lingered for a heartbeat before stooping to retrieve the discarded invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a pleasant smile as she turned to Addie. &#34;Mrs. White, would you happen to have another invitation? I&#39;d like to bring Damon along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White family had been keeping close tabs on the Murray family and knew they&#39;d just reunited with their long-lost daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re her lost daughter?&#34; Addie ventured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Eliana replied with a steady nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie&#39;s gaze swept over Eliana, lingering with faint appraisal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her features were striking, a flawless echo of Stella&#39;s youthful beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a wealthy household, such looks could be an advantage-but in a family stripped of its fortune, beauty this dazzling could just as easily turn into a burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A practiced smile curved across Addie&#39;s lips as she said warmly, course, I&#39;d be delighted if you came along with Damon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her signal, the bodyguard beside her stepped forward and promptly produced another invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana reached out to take it, her expression composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking entirely satisfied,Addie clasped her hand in a graceful grip. &#34;Your mother has always been a remarkable woman,&#34; she said, her tone sweet but edged. &#34;If only she weren&#39;t quite so stubborn. You, on the other hand, are sharper-more sensible. When I&#39;m idle, I like playing matchmaker, and if you and Damon attend, I&#39;ll see that you meet a man truly worth your while. Your family&#39;s no longer as prosperous as it once was, so it&#39;s best to secure a good match early. Don&#39;t repeat your mother&#39;s mistake of sacrificing everything for pride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding both invitations into her bag, Eliana offered a faint, courteous smile. &#34;I&#39;m grateful for your insight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, she turned and strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie&#39;s eyes followed her retreating figure, and with a slight tilt of her chin, she signafed to the bodyguard at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard leaned closer, and Addie&#39;s lips curved faintly as she asked, &#34;Has Barry been hanging around Qidence lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barry White-Zach&#39;s wayward nephew-was infamous for his aimless days and reckless antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Zach had lined up a respectable marriage for Barry, but just before the engagement, news broke that he&#39;d gotten another woman pregnant. The wedding collapsed in disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, Barry&#39;s illegitimate son was already four, and no decent young woman wanted to marry a man with that kind of baggage, no matter how hard his family tried to salvage his reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after seeing Eliana today, Addie&#39;s mind sparked with a scheme. If Eliana ended up with Barry, outsiders would have no grounds to accuse them of ingratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without tying the knot with Damon, she thought Barry&#39;s marriage to Eliana made little difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard gave a curt nod. &#34;Yes, he&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him to stay home and mind himself until the engagement banquet,&#34; Addie ordered,her tone clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; the bodyguard replied with a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Eliana hurried to catch up with Stella. &#34;Mom, slow down... Please, don&#39;t work yourself up. Your health comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting her daughter&#39;s worried gaze, Stella&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia..&#34; Her voice trembled with regret. &#34;I never should have trusted Addie enough to introduce Damon to Brenda. If they&#39;d never met, Brenda wouldn&#39;t have pushed him to take her horseback riding. Then his legs wouldn&#39;t have suffered any injury. I&#39;m to blame. I&#39;m completely to blame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana guided her gently into the back seat, one hand steadying her arm, the other smoothing her coat.&#34;Mom, you have to stop punishing yourself. None of this is on you,&#34; she said softly, her tone warm yet firm.&#34;If anyone deserves the blame, it&#39;s the White family. They&#39;re ungrateful and small-minded-we gain nothing by sinking to their level. Right now, what matters most is your health. If you let that woman&#39;s spite make you ill, you&#39;re giving her exactly what she wants. We can&#39;t let those we love suffer while our enemies laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a shaky breath, each word from Eliana settling deep in her chest, easing the weight pressing on her heart. Her sobs finally quieted, and she clasped Eliana&#39;s hand with renewed strength. &#34;You&#39;re right.I won&#39;t let them gloat over my misery. I&#39;lI take care of myself and wait for your dad&#39;s release.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the spirit.&#34; Eliana&#39;s lips curved in agreement, though a faint unease tugged at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was handling the news of Louis being taken far too calmly for the woman she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana couldn&#39;t reconcile this composed, almost detached demeanor with Addie&#39;s portrayal of her-or with the wife who would have been frantic over her husband&#39;s fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because their marriage had grown cold? Or was Stella hiding something deeper beneath that steady voice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana leaned toward the latter suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she asked gently, &#34;Mom, do you have any plan for dealing with Dad&#39;s situation? Or anyone you can reach out to for help? I can help you track them down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a faint shake of her head. &#34;He&#39;s been wrongly accused. Once the truth comes out, they&#39;ll let him go. You don&#39;t need to worry about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer felt evasive, lacking the weight of cerainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Eliana listened, the stronger her unease grew-convinced now that Stella was keeping something from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they returned home, Stella slipped away to her bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t lie down to rest-instead, she reached for her phone and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected almost instantly, and a deep, steady male voice came through. &#34;Stella, what&#39;s happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment to weigh her words, she asked softly, &#34;Louis has been locked up for nearly a week now.How much longer until he&#39;s released?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s tone remained unruffled. &#34;If we stick to the original plan, at least two months. We&#39;ve been using Louis and a few of our other men as bait to draw out those pests and wipe them out. Why the sudden concern? Something wrong at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his even voice, Stella realized her emotions had gotten the better of her. She had been far too impulsive today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a steadying breath before answering, her voice low. &#34;It&#39;s nothing seriouIs... We just found Lia after all these years, and she hasn&#39;t seen Louis since she came home. I guess I&#39;m feeling a little on edge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; the man replied gently. &#34;But this isn&#39;t something we can rush. One wrong move could wreck everything, and I&#39;m sure you understand that.&#34; After a beat, his tone softened even more. &#34;Still, don&#39;t worry-l&#39;ve got people on the inside keeping an eye on him. He won&#39;t be mistreated. Just make sure you don&#39;t let anything slip. Not even your sons can know about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Stella murmured, her expression firm. &#34;I&#39;ve kept it from them from the very start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine. I have other business to handle, so I&#39;ll end the call here. Tomorrow, my son will attend the welcome-home party and bring Lia a lavish gift-though he might not be able to make a formal appearance,&#34;the man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. It&#39;s perfectly fine if he can&#39;t come,&#34; Stella replied warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about convenience-it&#39;s my personal gesture,&#34; he said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she couldn&#39;t refuse without offending him, Stellagave a quiet nod of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the day of the welcome-home party arrived.</p>
