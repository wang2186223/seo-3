                <p>Eliana turned toward the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right-Celine Oliver. Rupert&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very same woman Tristan had asked her to help keep at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hated situations like this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, a guy from the Onyx Syndicate had begged her to pretend to be his girlfriend just to shake off a clingy admirer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had worked-the woman left him alone-but then the trouble had landed squarely on Eliana instead.That had only ended when Eliana got tired of the nonsense and took matters into her own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now here she was again, walking straight into déjà vu.Her first instinct had been to say no. But she owed Tristan, and she&#39;d promised to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d known she had to help him get rid of an admirer, she&#39;d have told him to forget it. She would have preferred to repay him in some other way. Now, she could only hope Celine wasn&#39;t the unreasonable sort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Celine&#39;s gaze, Eliana gave a polite nod. &#34;Yeah,I&#39;m Eliana Murray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine let out a drawn-out, almost amused,&#34;Alright,&#34;and slid into the seat beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dad&#39;s been working nonstop on a case lately,&#34; she began.&#39;&#34;It involves someone with the last name Murray... I wonder if that person might be related to you,Ms.Murray?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyelids twitched. &#34;What&#39;s his name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine held her gaze deliberately. &#34;Louis Murray.Chairman of the Murray Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s grip on her coffee cup tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silence was all the confirmation Celine needed-or at least thought she needed. But she kept going anyway, voice syrupy sweet. &#34;The surname Murray isn&#39;t exactly common, especially among Qidence.I was just curious, so I asked. I hope you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind,&#34; Eliana replied evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Louis... is he related to you?&#34; Celine pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t bother dodging it. &#34;He&#39;s my father.&#34; Celine&#39;s brows arched. She&#39;d suspected, sure-but hearing it out loud still made her pause. Not because Louis was Eliana&#39;s father, but because Tristan was engaged to Louis&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Qidence knew the Murrays were in shambles. Louis was facing sentencing any day now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Celine&#39;s mind, Tristan was far too shrewd to actually marry into that mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed he was just temporarily dazzled-after all, Eliana was undeniably beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outwardly, Celine&#39;s face stayed warm and pleasant.She reached over to take Eliana&#39;s hand, wearing a smile that didn&#39;t touch her eyes &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Eliana. I didn&#39;t mean to stir anything up-it just felt like such a coincidence.I didn&#39;t expect...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana calmly pulled her hand back. &#34;No need to apologize. You didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine nodded, then-just as quickly-took her hand again. &#34;Now that we&#39;ve met, we&#39;re friends. I&#39;ll mention your dad&#39;s case to my dad. Maybe we can help...within legal limits, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved kindly, but there wvas a chill in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression iced over. She yanked her hand  away and narrowed her eyes at her. &#34;Let me make one thing clear-l&#39;ve got a temper. If anyone dares to mess with me, my family, or my friends, I won&#39;t let it slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine blinked, taken aback. &#34;Have you got the wrong idea? I&#39;m being sincere here. I said that because I care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll pretend I heard nothing,&#34; Eliana said evenly.&#34;And you&#39;d better act like you know nothing either.Otherwise, I won&#39;t hesitate to take action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine&#39;s face crumpled into an even more aggrieved expression. &#34;Eliana, you&#39;ve really misunderstood me.I feel a connection with you, and I genuinely want to be friends. I have no ill intentions-I&#39;d never mess with you,your family, or your friends...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper right by Eliana&#39;s ear. &#34;I think you understand me perfectly. You&#39;ve got two choices-either break up with Tristan right now, or I&#39;ll have your dad do it for you. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was heavy with threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Celine could blink, Eliana suddenly-tipped her coffee cup-splashing the drink all over herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coffee wasn&#39;t hot,bout Eliana still cried out in pain,tears instantly welling and spilling down her cheeks Tristan&#39;s head snapped toward her. The moment he saw her crying, he crossed the room in long strides.&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana kept her gaze fixed on Celine. Her voice trembled as she spoke. &#34;Ms. Oliver, I know you like Tristan, but how could you... not only splash coffee on me, but threaten me with my father&#39;s case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine froze, caught off guard by the accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, cold smile flashed in Eliana&#39;s eyes. If Celine wanted to act, she would match her scene for scene.After all, she was here to put on a performance-and she didn&#39;t mind adding an extra act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Celine, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Rupert&#39;s voice cut through the tension as he approached, his expression grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the others in the room gathered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She splashed coffee on herself and accused me of it!&#34;Celine ground out through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert&#39;s gaze sharpened on Eliana. &#34;Ms. Murray, you do realize slander is a criminal offense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eliana&#39;s tears flowed even more freely. Her voice trembled as she turned pleading eyes to Tristan. &#34;1didn&#39;t slander her... She whispered to me that if l didn&#39;t break up with you, she&#39;d have her father go after mine. I refused, and then she splashed coffee on me. Tristan, you have to believe me. If you don&#39;t,we can check the surveillance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already noticed when she walked in that there were no cameras in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the kind of people present here, surveillance was deliberately avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it! You&#39;re lying! I won&#39;t let you get away with this!&#34; The gentle mask Celine had worn earlier was gone,replaced by raw fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana flinched, curling closer to Tristan as if seeking protection. &#34;Tristan, I can take her bullying and slandering me-but please don&#39;t let her hurt my father...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tear-streaked face was the picture of delicate beauty, tugging at the heartstrings of everyone watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s expression frosted, his eyes glinting with an icy resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently took Eliana&#39;s hand-the supposedly scalded one-and said in a low, steady voice, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I won&#39;t let anyone touch you or your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked over his shoulder. &#34;Doran,take Eliana and treat her hand.&#34; &#34;Understood!&#34; Doran stepped forward without delay,moving to shield Eliana from the crowd. &#34;Ms. Murray,please,this way.&#34;</p>
