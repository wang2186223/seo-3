                <p>Rupert&#39;s brows drew together the moment he heard the suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping away from Louis&#39;s case would also mean giving up control of Sheldon&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the very people who had backed him for the mayor&#39;s seat had done so with the goal of taking Sheldon down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause that seemed to stretch, Rupert snapped,&#34;Impossible! This matter is too significant. I can&#39;t just step aside without authority to do so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan replied calmly, &#34;If it&#39;s too much for you,then I&#39;ll take it to the higher-ups and request your removal from the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed like a blow, making Rupert&#39;s pulse jolt. Grinding his teeth, he said stiffly, &#34;There&#39;s no need for that. I&#39;ll keep my personal affairs separate from my duties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t soften as he replied, &#34;Even so,your connection to Celine Oliver makes it hard for me to feel reassured. Perhaps I should call the higher-ups  right now and explain the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his hand drift toward his phone, the motion deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; Rupert&#39;s voice broke with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility of this reaching the top was unthinkable-one leak, and his mayoral seat could be stripped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in several steadying breaths, he measured his options, then gave in. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll step back from the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smile curved Tristan&#39;s lips. This was the moment he had been waiting for-not a hollow apology, but a binding concession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood perfectly that Eliana cared less about hearing Celine&#39;s apology than about ensuring such trouble never arose again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a single nod, Tristan said, &#34;In that case, let&#39;s consider the matter closed. I trust everyone here will keep today&#39;s disagreement to themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads nodded all around in quiet agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t see a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, we were only here for coffee and a bit of conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone voiced their agreement, Tristan lifted a hand in acknowledgment. &#34;Then allow me to thank you all on Mayor Oliver&#39;s behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert&#39;s expression sank another shade darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no reason to stay, he gave a curt farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, keeping up the appearance of courtesy, said,&#34;There&#39;s still a competition later. Wouldn&#39;t you like to watch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not! I have urgent matters that cannot wait!&#34;Rupert&#39;s refusal came swift and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a short nod. &#34;Fair enough. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;d better hurry and get that withdrawal report sent to the higher-ups...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scowl on Rupert&#39;s face deepened, and he clamped his mouth shut. Without another word,he grabbed Celine and pulled her toward the back exit of the exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Celine leaned forward, her voice tight with worry. &#34;Dad, are you seriously backing out of the case? If you do, what are you going to tell them? You swore you would-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were cut short when his palm cracked against her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force snapped her head sideways, and for a moment, her vision swarmed with dizzy flickers, her vision swarmed with dizzy flickers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time her senses cleared, Rupert&#39;s voice was cold enough to freeze. &#34;You dare question me? This entire mess is on you! If not for your recklessness,how would I be backed into a corner? How would I be forced to abandon the case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders hunched instinctively under the weight of his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her teeth into her lip before murmuring,&#34;I swear, I didn&#39;t spill coffee on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert&#39;s mouth twisted into a mocking smile. &#34;And the threats? Are you denying those too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stole the air from Celine&#39;s lungs, and she dropped her gaze without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look that said he already knew the truth,Rupert asked, &#34;So, do you finally understand where you went wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine nodded and replied, &#34;I do. I shouldn&#39;t have used your name to scare her.I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong!&#34; Rupert cut her off sharply. &#34;That&#39;s not the  real issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden correction left her frozen in place,confusion clouding her face.If not that,then what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his eyes closing for a moment, Rupert said, &#34;You lost your head when it came to Eliana Murray.You thought she was easy to handle, and that arrogance blinded you,letting her set you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine&#39;s fingers curled slowly into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had,without a doubt, misjudged Eliana. Never had she imagined Eliana could be so cunning and convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though disappointment was clear in his tone, there was something else in Rupert&#39;s eyes-a trace of disbelief. &#34;You&#39;ve always been composed,clever,and patient. What happened today? Tristan may be outstanding, with a strong family name and plenty of talent. Men like him are rare. But you&#39;ve only spoken to him once. Why throw your sense away so easily,giving Eliana the perfect chance to lead you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still keeping her eyes on the floor,Celine said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t true that she&#39;d only met Tristan once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their days in elementary school, their paths had crossed more than once. In those years, they shared the same classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her looks were different back then, and she was often singled out and picked on for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particularly cruel day pushed her to the edge, and she tried to take her own life-until Tristan stepped in,urging her to hold on. He told her that if she didn&#39;t want to be an easy target, she needed to learn to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment, he was the only glimmer of hope she had during her school years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, he had no recognition of her, nor any memory of their shared past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the nights when Celine felt she couldn&#39;t endure anymore, thoughts of him were the only thing that kept her from breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she found out she would see him today,she poured her heart into her appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, her father&#39;s attempts to set them up were brushed aside when Tristan explained that he already had a fiancée.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed at first that it was just an excuse, right up until she saw Tristan approaching with Eliana&#39;s hand clasped in his. That sight nearly shattered her ability to keep her emotions in check. It was in that moment that her judgment slipped away entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had also failed to measure Eliana properly,which led to her being played right into Eliana&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Celine keeping quiet, Rupert let out a heavy breath. &#34;Enough! This is the first serious misstep you&#39;ve made all these years. I&#39;ll let it go this time, but there will never be a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Celine nodded in agreement. She promised herself she would never let her impulses rule her like that again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car merged onto the main road at a steady pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After mulling over her words, Celine finally asked,&#34;Does this mean you&#39;re truly stepping away from the case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you honestly think I have any choice? We&#39;ve already handed them the upper hand. If I refuse to step away from the case, the fallout will only grow. At worst, I&#39;ll take a reprimand now,&#34; Rupert answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure pulling out is the only option we have left?&#34; Celine pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing else to be done. I have to remove  myself completely from the matter. If I don&#39;t, and something happens to Louis, I&#39;ll be the one taking the fall,&#34; Rupert explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choice weighed heavily on him, and for once,retreat felt like the only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the unwillingness on her face, Rupert&#39;s tone hardened. &#34;You&#39;re staying home until this blows over.Don&#39;t step outside. When the problem is dealt with,we&#39;ll find another solution. Until then, avoid any connection with the Murray family. Even if they insult you to your face,you will endure it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine nodded, her face pale. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Doran guided Eliana into a small resting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the exhibition hall lacked a medical station,Doran suggested she run cool water over the burn while he went to get ointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana flatly refused, &#34;I don&#39;t need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not an option. If you don&#39;t treat it now,you could end up with blisters,&#34; Doran said, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her hand, Eliana revealed smooth, unmarked skin-no sign of the scald at all.</p>
