                <p>Pain bloomed across Khloe&#39;s cheek, and her hand flew up to shield it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wide eyes swung toward Miguel, disbelief pouring into her voice. &#34;Dad... you&#39;d actually hit me over some street beggar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words even faded, another slap cracked against her skin-harder, sharper, leaving the sting burning deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush rose on both cheeks, the swelling already visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beggar? She&#39;s an honored doctor! Mind your tongue!&#34; Jeffry&#39;s tone cut like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked Khloe&#39;s eyes, and she spun on her heel,fury pushing her toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby&#39;s voice chased after her. &#34;Khloe! Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave her. She&#39;ll come back,&#34; Jeffry said, catching Ruby&#39;s arm before she could follow, instead giving her a pointed glance toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Ruby turned back. The only choice left was to mend the damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing her composure, she stepped toward Eliana,lowering her head. &#34;I truly apologize. I failed as a mother, and my daughter&#39;s behavior has caused you offense...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana lifted her hand, cutting off the rest of Ruby&#39;s words. &#34;I keep my word. You&#39;ve given her the slap-consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief softened both Jeffry and Ruby&#39;s expressions,knowing she wouldn&#39;t press the matter any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then at least join us for a meal. Wle&#39;d like to thank you properly,&#34; Jeffry said, his tone almost eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance at her phone had Eliana shaking her head.&#34;Thanks, but I can&#39;t. There&#39;s something urgent I need to deal with. But I&#39;ll leave you a new prescription. Once the current meds run out, follow it every day. That should keep the patient stable for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel latched onto those last two words, his brow tightening. &#34;How long... exactly, do I have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A year,&#34; Eliana answered plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room shifted, most faces brightening at the news-none more so than Jeffry&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, a year was more than enough time for Miguel to secure his path forward. After that,whether the old man lived or not was of little concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel alone felt the weight of the news. To him, a single year was far too short. Still, it wasn&#39;t hard to understand. Those who brushed against death often clung tighter to life, not less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would it be possible to come to you again after that year is up?&#34; Miguel asked, unable to hide the hope in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana was never one to offer promises she couldn&#39;t keep. &#34;If my schedule allows, I can visit and check on you,&#34; she said evenly. &#34;But I can&#39;t promise the same outcome.Some treatments lose their strength after the first round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even that much left Miguel quietly relieved. He looked at her with new hope in his eyes. &#34;No matter what, I owe you my life. If you ever need something from the Clarke family, name it-we&#39;ll move mountains if we have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana let the offer stand. Deep down, she knew there might come a day when she&#39;d call it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring me some paper and a pen,&#34; Eliana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry didn&#39;t hesitate, hurrying off to fetch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she began writing, graceful strokes flowed across the page, each line carrying a practiced elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Tristan caught a glimpse. For a heartbeat, he paused-was he imagining things, or had he seen that handwriting before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could get a better look, Jeffry folded the prescription and tucked it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, truly. Since you&#39;ve got urgent business today, I won&#39;t hold you up. Allow me to walk you out,&#34;Jeffry said, his gratitude plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. I prefer to leave quietly,&#34; Eliana replied, her tone light but final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; Jeffry insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go if that&#39;s what she wants,&#34; Miguel interjected, knowing she had no patience for over-attentive hosts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People like her were never easy to accommodate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If extending his life meant giving in to her wishes,Miguel was willing to do so without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that consent hanging in the air, Jeffry had little choice but to follow through. &#34;Please, take care,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a short nod, accepted the neatly wrapped Goosegrass Ruby had bought, and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her work here was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The matter of payment was Seth&#39;s responsibility, not hers. All she had to do was get the job done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she stepped out, the only guest left in the room was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s smile shifted into something overly polite.&#34;Mr. Pearson, why don&#39;t we talk over some drinks?With all the worry over my father&#39;s condition, I&#39;m afraid we may not have treated you as well as we should have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to apologize. Seeing Mr. Clarke in good health is reason enough for me to be pleased,&#34;Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he spoke, a flicker of amusement crossed his mind. Since taking the helm of the Pearson Group, he had never once been upstaged-until today, by a young woman who had effortlessly stolen the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If circumstances allowed, he would have gladly caught up with Eliana for a proper conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his visit today had a clear purpose-checking on Miguel&#39;s condition and handling business matters with Jeffry-so walking out just to follow Eliana wasn&#39;t an option. Something told him, though,that their paths would cross again soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the estate, Neal and Leyla&#39;s eyes met in a shared,uneasy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla had been escorted out by Hector earlier. He&#39;d asked her to leave first, and she&#39;d agreed, but instead of going far, she lingered near the entrance,secretly hoping Eliana would fail in treating Miguel so she could salvage her own reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal, on the other hand, had been planted there under Khloe&#39;s orders, unwilling to step inside without her approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The awkwardness between them was evident-both were outsiders in the Clarke family&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek red sports car suddenly rolled past the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tinted window slid down, revealing Khloe behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Khloe? What are you doing here?I thought you said once you delivered the Goosegrass, you&#39;d use the chance to get your parents to meet me,&#34; Neal said,surprise lacing his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s face clouded instantly. There had been a time when she adored him without question. Now,looking at him, that same rush of feeling was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the lingering fury from her run-in with Eliana and Jeffry. Or maybe it was the memory of Tristan-his striking face and commanding presence refusing to leave her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few people knew much about Tristan yet. For years,h e&#39;d been an illegitimate son, but once he fully stepped into power, his name would spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when that happened, plenty of women would be chasing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Khloe prided herself on her loyalty. Pushing down those stray thoughts, she said flatly, &#34;Get in.Today isn&#39;t the right time to introduce you to my parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neal started to question her, but his eyes caught on the angry red marks across her cheeks-two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression hardened. &#34;Khloe... who hit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of that bitch!&#34; she spat, her voice thick with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch?&#34; Neal frowned, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! The one from the herbal pharmacy,&#34; Khloe scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s here? I&#39;ll take care of her right now!&#34; Neal growled, rolling up his sleeves as if ready to storm in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe caught his arm before he could take another step. &#34;Hop in. I&#39;ll fill you in later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, Neal pulled open the door and slid into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the curb,Leyla watched them drive off, a flicker of envy tightening in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been standing there for nearly thirty minutes,and Hector still hadn&#39;t contacted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of unease twisted in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the Murray household, she&#39;d been surrounded by doting parents and six brothers. But now, with her ties to them severed, Hector was all she had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every decision he made rippled through her life,shaping her future. That was why she couldn&#39;t afford to lose her place in his heart. Without him, there would be nowhere for her to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought only deepened her bitterness toward Eliana. If not for that woman, she wouldn&#39;t have been humiliated and cast out of the Clarkes&#39; estate today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden movement drew her attention-a sleek black Porsche rolled to a stop in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the license plate made her eyes narrow. She knew that car. It belonged to Sean.</p>
