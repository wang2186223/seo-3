                <p>Laughter, chatter, and the clinking of glasses filled every corner of the villa, and no matter how far Eliana walked, the noise followed her like a stubborn shadow. Only when the hum of voices dimmed did she slip her phone from her pocket and dial Seth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The transfer we talked about can get underway tomorrow,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seth was delighted. &#34;That place is massive. Even if you just leased it, you&#39;d rake in a fortune. Are you telling me Carl really handed it over to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did,&#34; replied Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like the Murray family&#39;s treating you better than I expected,&#34; Seth answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t deny it. Aside from Sean&#39;s occasional outbursts, the rest of the family had shown her genuine kindness-none more so than Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time spent with Stella had given her a taste of something she&#39;d never known before-maternal warmth, the kind that felt like stumbling upon a hidden treasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s light sleeping habits meant she noticed the quiet moments, like Stella gently tucking her in at night.\</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone who had grown up without a mother&#39;s care, that simple act felt like something rare and priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the line, Seth said, &#34;If they&#39;re good to you, do you want me to dig into who set your father up? We could find out the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Eliana&#39;s identity as the Murray daughter was revealed, Seth had already run a surface check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth had been clear-Louis had been set up-but he hadn&#39;t pushed deeper. because she hadn&#39;t given the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then replied, &#34;Let&#39;s hold off for now.&#34; From the way Stella had reacted, there was more to the matter than it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Onyx Syndicate already had eyes on them, and probing into Louis&#39;s case would only invite trouble Besides, she had a strong feeling Louis might have walked into it on purpose. That made rash moves dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Seth replied. He took her caution for mistrust toward the Murray family and left it there. &#34;I&#39;ll get things lined up so the transfer starts first thing tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. They&#39;re going to have a rough time settling in, so see to it that everyone gets a good reward tonight from me,&#34; Eliana instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, her eyes lifted to the lone morning star gleaming like a jewel in the dark sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to linger under the night for a while, anything to postpone crossing paths with the so-called elite waiting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence lasted only a few seconds before a strange tension crept into her senses. Someone unfamiliar was drawing near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit together, yet she kept her gaze fixed on the heavens, pretending nothing had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short distance away, Barry advanced with cautious steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t wanted to set foot in the Murray estate. In his mind, marrying a girl from the countryside was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Zach&#39;s orders weren&#39;t something he could ignore, not when he still owed both Zach and Addie enough to sink him for life. His pride could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That resolve cracked the moment he saw Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even among the parade of beautiful women in the Murray halls, Eliana drew every eye without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look, and Barry was captivated. When she slipped outside alone, he cut short his conversation with another guest and trailed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing she had no idea he was behind her, he closed in and reached to pull her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his hand could reach her, Eliana caught him and flipped him over her shoulder, slamming him hard onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain clenched his jaw as he tried to push himself up, only to feel a knife press against his throat the very next moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, who the hell are you?&#34; Eliana demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain and humiliation flared in Barry, but when he looked up, the sight of her face bathed in moonlight stole the heat from his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For extraordinary beauty like this, he thought, maybe she could be forgiven for putting him on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick, eager smile spread across his face. &#34;Hey now, no need to get the wrong idea. I&#39;m not some creep...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk. Who are you? Because if you don&#39;t, I might just forget to keep this knife steady.&#34; Eliana cut in, her voice low and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barry was hooked. The beauty alone was enough to turn heads, but it was the confidence in her posture,the edge in her tone-she was unlike any woman he&#39;d ever crossed paths with. And he wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your fiancé. Name&#39;s Barry. You can call me that,&#34; he said without a hint of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fiancé?&#34; Eliana found it amusing. &#34;That&#39;s interesting. Considering I wasn&#39;t aware I&#39;d ágreed to marry anyone named Barry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, she already had two names tied to her in that regard-Tristan and Neal. This stranger certainly wasn&#39;t either of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to keep his eyes off the knife, Barry quickly said, &#34;I&#39;m Barry White. My uncle and his wife sent me here,told me you were going to be my bride.&#34; Eliana asked disdainfully, &#34;And who exactly are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My uncle is Zach White. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ve told you about me?&#34; Barry asked, his voice careful but probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zach White?&#34; Eliana&#39;s brows lifted, a glint of mockery flashing in her eyes. &#34;So his wife works fast-already arranging me a future husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of excitement lit Barry&#39;s face. &#34;Then Addie has spoken to you about me. How about putting that knife down? I&#39;m really your future fiancé...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the knife still in her grip, he quickly added, &#34;Listen, if you marry me, I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re taken care of. Anything you want, it&#39;s yours. And your father-since he&#39;s been taken in-we&#39;ve got the power to pull some strings and get him released.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana almost laughed outright. She was seconds from calling Jordy to drag Barry out when a rich, smooth voice cut through the night. &#34;Seems the title of Ms. Murray&#39;s fiancé is in high demand tonight...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both she and Barry turned toward the sound-and were met with a vision framed in moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man stood tall in a fitted black suit, a faint, unreadable smile on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his eyes, dark and unyielding, were locked on Barry with a chill sharp enough to bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none other than Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barry&#39;s mouth went dry, his eyes going wide. &#34;M-Mr. Pearson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight tilt of Tristan&#39;s head was all it took. Rocco and Doran mnoved in, each gripping a shoúlder and forcing Barry down until his knees slammed the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot up Barry&#39;s legs, dragging a hiss from his throat, but he swallowed it quickly, replacing it with a forced, toothy smile. &#34;Mr. Pearson, what&#39;s going on? I don&#39;t understand... I haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped forward, his gaze unwavering. &#34;No, you haven&#39;t-unless you count attempting to steal my fiancée.&#34; &#34;Y-your fiancée?&#34; Barry blurted, whipping around to stare at Eliana as if the words themselves were absurd.A country-raised girl like her-Tristan&#39;s fiancée? No way. If that were true, why would Addie be arranging his marriage to Eliana? And the Pearsons? With their standards, they&#39;d never welcome the disgraced Murray family,let alone replace the well-bred Leyla with someone who&#39;d grown up far from privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson, there&#39;s got to be a mistake here. Ms. Murray is about to get engaged to me..&#34;</p>
