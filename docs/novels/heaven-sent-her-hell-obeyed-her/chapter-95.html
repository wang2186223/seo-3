                <p>The moment the words left Eliana&#39;s mouth, every gaze slid to Leyla&#39;s wrist-including her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all the chaos, she had totally forgotten about the scratch marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Eliana mentioned it, her memory flickered back-Davin had scratched her during the struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of panic crossed her eyes before she quickly masked it with a look of wounded innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon said his chest hurt, so I tried to help him. He scratched me by accident. Why even bring it up?&#34;Leyla asked, feigning confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes darkened. Earlier, in the operating room, she&#39;d checked whether Davin had swallowed her pill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had, the surgery would&#39;ve been smoother; the pill she&#39;d developed was designed to protect the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But during the examination, she noticed dried blood under his fingernails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked for the pill, butit was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone had stirred suspicion. And now, seeing the scratch on Leyla&#39;s wrist, Eliana was almost certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she needed proof-Davin&#39;s own words-to corner Leyla completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing her with a cool stare, Eliana said evenly, &#34;You&#39;d better not be lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;Why would I lie about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t bother to reply her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth would surface once Davin woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d deliberately exaggerated earlier, just loud enough for Leyla to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Davin had an eighty-percent chance of waking within the week. She stepped toward Tristan, meeting his gaze with a faint, weary smile. &#34;Looks like I owe you another favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a light shrug. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. You don&#39;t need to pay me back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla, however, felt a feeling of unease settle in her chest at his words-only to quickly smother the thought.She hadn&#39;t forgotten that Tristan was engaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jonny appeared at her side, concern etched on his face as he asked about the injury on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla shook her head lightly. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, just a scratch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny frowned. &#34;That&#39;s not nothing. If it gets infected, you&#39;ll regret it. Come on, I&#39;ll take you to get it treated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to leave the tense atmosphere, Leyla didn&#39;t resist and allowed him to guide her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doran instinctively moved to block them, but Tristan&#39;s sharp look held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hadn&#39;t objected, which meant she had her reasons. Tristan saw no point in interfering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Jonny&#39;s blind devotion was pathetic, but harmless. Detaining him would only breed resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Stan and Leonie hurried over to thank Eliana and Tristan before rushing off to see Davin through the ICU viewing window. Visitors were not allowed in just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them go, Tristan chuckled under his breath. &#34;Davin&#39;s grandson really can&#39;t see straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved faintly, dismissively. &#34;He&#39;ll see through Leyla&#39;s true color soon. No sense in arguing about it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s tone turned thoughtful. &#34;You&#39;re convinced she had something to do with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shook her head. &#34;I can&#39;t say for sure she provoked Davin and made him collapse. But the pill I gave him... it&#39;s gone. Davin wouldn&#39;t throw away even a scrap of paper I gave him. There&#39;s no way he&#39;d discard that pill.&#34; Just then, Rocco rushed over and opened his palm. Resting there was a pill. &#34;Ms. Murray-is this the one you gave him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes widened. She snatched it up immediately. &#34;Where did you find this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco explained, &#34;Mr. Pearson suspected Leyla, so I retraced her steps. At the café, I searched the private room and found this suck on the window ledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco had seen Eliana hand the pill to Davin earlier, so he recognized it immediately and brought it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes burned hotter with anger. &#34;Leyla must have tossedit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows knitted. &#34;Want me to drag her back here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shook her head. &#34;No need. Once Davin wakes, the truth will come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan accepted that with a short nod, then turned to Doran. &#34;Post two people by the ICU. Quietly. If anyone suspicious shows up, take them down immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Doran snapped to attention and left to carry out the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On Tristan&#39;s order, he ran through names of men he could trust for a job like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was gone, Eliana looked back at Tristan. &#34;Thank you for today. I&#39;ve been stretched thin lately. I may not be able to make the trip to Eighvale. If you can, bring your father to Qidence. It&#39;ll be easier for me to treat him here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a small nod.&#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elbert&#39;s condition wasn&#39;t critical, so there was no rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her. &#34;Where are you headed next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Home. Carl texted-he&#39;s been waiting in the parking lot,&#34; Eliana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disappointment crossed his features. She didn&#39;t need him to drive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he smothered it wth calm patience. They had time. He could wait. &#34;I&#39;ll walk you there,&#34; he offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana opened her mouth to refuse. &#34;No-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cut her off smoothly. &#34;Rocco&#39;s car is there too. We&#39;re heading in the same direction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana let the protest die on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Tristan shifted the conversation. &#34;The authorities picked up a few more members of the Fist Guild, but remnants are still out there-especially Kohen, their former leader. Be careful. His reputation is darker than Flint&#39;s, and people say he&#39;s even more skilled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&#34; Eliana said. &#34;Thanks for the warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll push for the rest of them to be caught soon,&#34; Tristan added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, Carl and Jordy came running over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, how&#39;s Davin?&#34; Carl&#39;s voice cracked with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s tone softened, steady and reassuring. &#34;The surgery&#39;s over. He&#39;s unconscious for now, but there shouldn&#39;t be any major problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl let out a long breath. Relief washed over his features. &#34;That&#39;s great news. I wanted to check for myself but didn&#39;t want to make a mess of things, so I waited here. By the way-Mom called. She&#39;s wondering why we&#39;re still out. I gave her an excuse, but we&#39;d better head back before she grows suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana nodded in agreement. Then she turned, gave Tristan a brief nod of farewell, and slid into a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the drive, Carl&#39;s phone rang again. He put it on speaker. Stella&#39;s voice, bright with excitement,filled the car. &#34;Carl, get home quick-and bring Lia. Rowell&#39;s back.&#34;</p>
