                <p>Before Leyla could utter a word, Carl stepped forward with blazing displeasure etched across his face. &#34;Let me make one thing crystal clear,&#34; he declared, his voice cutting through the crowd&#39;s murmur. &#34;I don&#39;t have a sister who steals my work and lacks basic morals. My sister has always been Eliana-and no one else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flashed with righteous anger as he continued. &#34;As for Leyla, when our family faced bankruptcy,instead of standing by us, she immediately demanded that my sick mother cut all ties with her and sign a formal document severing our family bond! I happen to have that very agreement right here. Everyone, see for yourselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those damning words, he pulled out the crumpled agreement and held it high for everyone to witness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla staggered backward, her legs threatening to buckle beneath her as the blood drained from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted into shocked whispers that spread like wildfire through the gallery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stealing someone&#39;s artwork is bad enough-it shows what kind of person she really is. But abandoning the family that raised her? That proves she&#39;s completely heartless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder they banned her from future competitions. Someone like that has no right entering any contest ever again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the Murray family rescued,her from an orphanage when she was just a child. Without their kindness, she&#39;d probably still be there. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They must be cursed to have taken in such a backstabbing ingrate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cruel words crashed over her like ocean waves, Leyla&#39;s face drained of all color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up, all of you!&#34; she screamed, her voice cracking with desperate fury. &#34;You know absolutely nothing about my situation, so how dare you judge me like this?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation stung because it held a grain of truth-she had indeed cut ties with the Murray family the moment their financial empire began to crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet deep in her heart, she believed they bore equal responsibility for what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they truly adopted her out of pure kindness, or was it simply because she looked like Eliana as a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was convinced they had merely used her as a replacement to fill the gaping hole left by Eliana&#39;s disappearance,treating her like an emotional Band-Aid for their grief! If even married couples abandoned each other during major crises, why should an adopted daughter be held to a higher standard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Armed with this twisted logic, Leyla convinced herself that she had done absolutely nothing wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained certain that with her adorable childhood looks, countless other families would have eagerly adopted her without the Murrays ever entering the picture. Therefore, in her mind, she owed them absolutely nothing-not gratitude, not loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You self-righteous hypocrites understand nothing about my life, yet you dare stand on your moral pedestals to condemn me!&#34; she shrieked at the crowd, her carefully constructed facade finally shattering into a million pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathered spectators shook their heads in unified disgust, their expressions growing darker by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her-completely unrepentant even now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Terrible people never see their own evil-that&#39;s what makes them so dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your breath on someone like her. Selfish people like that only care about themselves-she&#39;ll never listen to reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though their voices fell silent, their eyes burned with increasing revulsion as they stared at Leyla like she was something toxic they wanted to scrape off their shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those contemptuous stares ignited a firestorm of rage and self-pity within Leyla&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whirled around to face Hector, tears streaming down her cheeks. &#34;Hector, they&#39;re ganging up on me!They&#39;re being so cruel, andl-&#34; &#34;Enough! Just stop!&#34; Hector&#39;s voice thundered, silencing everyone. &#34;You stole someone else&#39;s masterpiece and lied to my face, making me believe it was your original creation. Leyla, you&#39;ve disappointed me beyond words!&#34; He shook his head slowly, his handsome features twisted with unmistakable disappointment and revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla felt as though the ground had opened beneath her feet-she couldn&#39;t fathom that even Hector now looked at her with such obvious disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony cut like a blade through her heart-after all, Hector himself had been the mastermind who suggested she abandon the Murray family during their darkest financial hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Jeffry harbored deep animosity toward the Murrays, Hector had whispered poisonous advice that cutting all ties might finally earn her Jeffry&#39;s acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those manipulative words had driven her to ruthlessly draft the document that severed every bond with the people who had raised her from childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now he stared at her with the same cold disdain as every other person in the room. The betrayal felt like swallowing shards of glass-Leyla simply couldn&#39;t accept this cruel reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hector, you can&#39;t abandon me like this!&#34; Leyla lunged forward and seized his hand with desperate fingers,her voice breaking with raw desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he yanked his hand away as if her touch burned him. &#34;Take some time to pull yourself together!&#34;he snapped coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those cutting words, Hector spun on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, his feelings for her hadn&#39;t completely died, but today she had humiliated him so thoroughly that his pride couldn&#39;t bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, the sight of her face made his stomach churn with shame and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry had vanished like smoke the instant Leyla&#39;s plagiarism blazed across the massive display screen for eve ryone to witness. Just then, Tristan emerged from the crowd like an avenging angel and addressed Leyla with icy politeness.&#34;Please remove yourself from the premises immediately. We don&#39;t welcome individuals of questionable character.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his commanding words, Rocco and Doran materialized beside him like twin shadows. &#34;Miss,&#34; they said in unison, their voices dripping with barely contained menace,I you walk out on your own two feet,or shall we &#39;assist&#39; you with your departure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave by myself! Leyla snarled at them with the fury of a cornered wildcat,her beautiful features twisted into an ugly mask of rage as she whirled around to make her humiliating exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stumbled toward the exit, she carved this moment of public disgrace into her memory like words etched in stone, swearing a silent oath that someday she would make every single one of them pay dearly for this humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Leyla&#39;s dramatic departure, the excited chatter gradually faded into blessed silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s attention shifted like a tide toward Carl, showering the rising star of design and oil painting with enthusiastic congratulations and admiring praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Tristan moved through the dispersing crowd with the fluid grace of a predator until he reached Eliana&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close enough that his breath tickled her ear, he murmured in a voice meant for her alone, &#34;That was quite the spectacular drama you orchestrated. I&#39;m curious-should I expect more such entertaining displays in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana fixedhim with a withering glare that could have frozen hellfire. &#34;Has anyone ever mentioned that you&#39;re incredibly nosy and should mind your own business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan lifted his broad shoulders in an infuriatingly casual shrug. &#34;Not really. You have the distinguished honor of being the very first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems your so-called friends are nothing but shameless flatterers who wouldn&#39;t recognize honesty if it slapped them in the face,&#34; Eliana observed with cutting sarcasm. Tristan arched one dark eyebrow with genuine amusement dancing in his eyes. &#34;Well then, now I have the rare privilege of a friend who actually tells me the brutal truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who in their right mind said we were friends?&#34; Eliana shot back with the speed of a striking viper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my mistake.&#34; Tristan tapped his forehead with exaggerated contrition, though his eyes sparkled with mischief. &#34;I nearly forgot the most important detail-you&#39;re not my friend at all. You&#39;re my beloved fiancée.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana rolled her eyes and hissed with arctic coldness, &#34;Since you already have a girlfriend warming your bed,you should show some basic decency and keep your distance. I&#39;d rather not deal with some jealous woman coming after me because of your wandering attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s casual demeanor cracked as a deep frown carved lines across his forehead. &#34;Who the hell told you I have a girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want the whole world to know about your romantic escapades, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t conduct them in public,&#34; Eliana sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear I don&#39;t-&#34; Tristan began desperately, his usual composure finally cracking as he attempted to set the record straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before he could complete his urgent explanation, Davin materialized beside them with the worst possible timning imaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley, will you be gracing our city of Qidence with your presence for an extended visit?&#34; he inquired with the eager anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s harsh expression melted into something warmer and more genuine as she turned to face the distinguished older gentleman.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s absolutely wonderful news! When your schedule permits, I would be deeply honored if you&#39;d visit my humble home for coffee and perhaps share some of your invaluable wisdom with an old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the special bond they shared and the genuine affection she held for him, Eliana didn&#39;t hesitate for even a heartbeat before agreeing. &#34;Splendid! Well then, I should take my leave now. After all the drama and excitement of today&#39;s events,I&#39;m feeling rather drained and need to retreat home for some much-needed rest,&#34; Davin declared with a weary smile. Eliana had started to nod her understanding when something made her pause-Davin&#39;s usually vibrant complexion had taken on an unhealthy pallor that sent alarm bells ringing in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A concerned frown creased her brow as she studied his face with growing worry. &#34;Davin, when was your last medical examination?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin released a soft chuckle that held more resignation than humor. &#34;At my advanced age, such things seem rather pointless. When the Grim Reaper comes calling, he comes calling. No sense in wasting precious medical resources on an old fossil like me.&#34; His tone remained deliberately light and dismissive, completely oblivious to the potential danger lurking within his own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s voice sharpened with professional concern. &#34;Your color is all wrong-something&#39;s definitely not right. Please let me examine you properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These weary old bones are just feeling their age, nothing more. A few hours of proper rest will have me right as rain again-mark my words.&#34; Davin brushed away her concern with a gentle yet firm gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana&#39;s trained instincts refused to be silenced so easily. She frantically rummaged through her bag until her fingers closed around a small pill, which she pressed firmly into Davin&#39;s weathered palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she gripped his hand with both of hers, her voice deadly serious. &#34;I suspect you may be developing a serious heart condition. Promise me that after you rest, you&#39;ll go straight to the hospitaI for a complete cardiac workup. If you experience any sudden chest pain or discomfort-any at all-swallow this pil immediately before calling an ambulance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, if it will ease your worried mind.&#34; Davin carefully tucked the life-saving pill into his vest pocket,gave Eliana one last gentle wave, and slowly made his way toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As hisfootsteps echoed through the marble foyer toward the grand entrance, he discovered Leyla lurking in the shadows like a predator lying in wait, her presence clearly no coincidence.</p>
