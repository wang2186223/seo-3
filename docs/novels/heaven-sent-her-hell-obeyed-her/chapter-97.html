                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t the type to meddle in other people&#39;s business. But for those who treated her sincerely, she would always return the favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell was beaming. From the very first moment he met Eliana, he&#39;d felt that inexplicable bond only siblings could share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as you like it,&#34; hesaid warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Damon spoke up. &#34;Lia, help me upstairs. There are things we need to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana immediately thought of the time she&#39;d introduced Damon to Seth. She still wasn&#39;t sure how that situation had resolved. &#34;Perfect. I have something I need to talk to you about too,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help Damon upstairs with you!&#34; Rowell volunteered enthusiastically-only to have Carl catch him by the collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In those heels? Please. You&#39;ll break your ankle and send all three of you tumbling down the stairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell lifted his chin confidently. &#34;Relax, I&#39;ve been practicing in these heels for days-I&#39;m solid. Watch this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strutted forward with surprising ease, as though he were born wearing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana&#39;s sharp eyes caught the faint bruises circling his ankles-the kind the kind that only came from past sprains and tumbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flickered with a complicated mix of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite constant setbacks, Rowell wasn&#39;t like Damon, who had once sunk into despair. Instead, he remained endlessly optimistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rowell,&#34; she said gently, pushing back her thoughts. &#34;Stay with Mom. Let Carl help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl puffed his chest in pride at being selected, while Rowell scoffed, rolling his eyes before obediently returning to Stella&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Rowell stepped out of earshot, his face changed-all cheer gone. &#34;Mom,&#34; he whispered seriously, &#34;I&#39;ve been looking into Dad&#39;s case. He&#39;s innocent-got dragged in by someone else&#39;s scandal.That someone was just cannon fodder in a bigger power struggle. And in the end... Dad became the scapegoat of scapegoats. This time... we&#39;re in real trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s smile froze. She hadn&#39;t expected Rowell to uncover so much. She quickly grabbed his hand. &#34;Rowell,leave this to me.I have my own way of handling your father&#39;s case. Don&#39;t trouble yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Mom-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as I say,&#34; Stella cut him off in a clipped tone. &#34;This isn&#39;t up for discussion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell was taken aback by her unusual sternness. He swallowed, then nodded reluctantly. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go upstairs and change back into something decent. Wearing that... it&#39;s strange.&#34; She sighed softly.She did want a daughter, but she already had one. Rowell was better off as a son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell grinned and went to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile upstairs in Damon&#39;s room, the moment Elianna and Damon were alone, his expression sharpened. &#34;Lia, that person you asked me to help-who is he exactly?&#34; he asked in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s gaze flickered. She kept her tone light. &#34;Why are you suddenly asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because while I was doing that task, I realized-that wasn&#39;t the work of just one man. He belongs to a group.And that group has a powerful background. I&#39;m worried... you might be walking into danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s smile didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. He&#39;s an old friend. He wouldn&#39;t harm me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon frowned. &#34;Do you even know what organization he belongs to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hesitated...then slowly shook her head. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face darkened. &#34;And yet you say he&#39;s an old friend? Lia, people&#39;s hearts are the hardest to read.I don&#39;t want you getting hurt. Stop contacting him. I&#39;m warning you-l sense danger.&#34; Eliana&#39;s gaze was calm, unwavering. &#34;I can protect myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing he couldn&#39;t change her mind, Damon let out a heavy sigh. &#34;Do you know whose firewall they wanted me to crack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to ask Seth, so she simply followed Damon&#39;s lead. &#34;Whose firewall is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;Tristan&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. Tristan? Why would Seth target him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wanted me to get in and erase a certain video file,&#34; Damon explained. &#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it, but Tristan isn&#39;t someone you can afford to provoke. If he finds out you were involved, I&#39;m afraid...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brimmed with worry-not for himself, but for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, smiled, unbothered. &#34;Damon, did you leave any traces after breaching the firewall?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then there&#39;s nothing to worry about. With your skills, Tristan will never trace it back. He&#39;ll never know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon frowned. &#34;Nothing is one hundred percent certain. Better safe than sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl stepped in with two glasses of water. Noticing the tension in the room, he asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon quickly shook his head. &#34;Nothing. I was just reminding Lia of a few things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl didn&#39;t press. &#34;Alright then. Mom wants us downstairs for dinner. Let me help you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl and Eliana supported Damon on both sides as they went downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Damon summoned Carl to his room. His expression was grim. &#34;Carl, stick close to Lia these next few days. Make sure she&#39;s safe.&#34; Carl frowned. &#34;Is she in danger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon avoided mentioning Tristan. &#34;Just a precaution. She made some... friends while she was away in the countryside. She&#39;s too trusting, too naive. I&#39;m worried she might get misled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s lips twitched. Naive? If anything, Eliana had more lie experience than all of them put together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since he had promised her to keep her secrets, he only nodded.&#34;Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Also, check on Sean. The heat&#39;s cooled down. If he can come back, have him return. I&#39;ll feel more at ease knowing he&#39;s guarding Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elianna had her bath and changed into dark clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the monitors confirmed the whole household was asleep, she slipped out quietly and made her way to the Onyx Syndicate&#39;s new base in Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just one afternoon, the abandoned factory had been turned into a fortress-guards stationed everywhere.From the outside, it still looked like nothing more than a crumbling ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gates creaked open. The men greeted her in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gave a brief nod and headed straight for Seth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was mid-conversation with his subordinates, but the moment she stepped inside, he quickly greeted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t reply. She pulled out a chair, sat down, and crossed her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on him, sharp and unrelenting. Seth shifted uncomfortably under her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are youlooking at me like that? You&#39;re scaring me.&#34;</p>
