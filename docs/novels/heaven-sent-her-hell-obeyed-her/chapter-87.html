                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon! It&#39;s me,Leyla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her voice, Davin&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flanked by two bodyguards, he had no intention of stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she kept chasing after the car, breathless and desperate, he finally lifted a hand. The driver brought the car to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window slid down, and Davin leaned back, expression flat as stone, waiting for her to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon!&#34; Leyla&#39;s face was streaked with tears. &#34;I thought you&#39;d already given up on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows pulled together. &#34;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I stopped only to make things clear. I don&#39;t take students with stained record. From this moment on, you&#39;re no longer my student. And you are not to use my name again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s lips trembled, her complexion draining to paper-white. But she had expected this. She swallowed hard,forcing her voice steady.&#34;1know plagiarism was wrong... but I had no choice. My sister pushed me into it. She did it for her brother&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s eyes flickered, the first crack in his calm mask. He hadn&#39;t known. After exposing Leyla&#39;s plagiarism,he&#39;d left unsettled-missing the scene where Carl delivered the severance papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea about the twisted ties between Leyla and Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,he was a little hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his hesitation, Leyla rushed on, &#34;Please, just give me a moment to explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin was strict to the bone, bound by rules. But if there was another truth behind all this, he couldn&#39;t ignore it. Conveniently, there was a café nearby. He exhaled and gave a curt nod. &#34;You have the time it takes to finish a cup of coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes lit up with relief.&#34;Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d hear her out first before he decided to completely cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Leyla steered him to a private room away from prying eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll have an lced Black,&#34; she told the waiter, then turned quickly. &#34;What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about their signature drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a dismissive wave. &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter.&#34; He wasn&#39;t exactly here to chill over drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drinks arrived soon after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin took one sip, then cut straight through the silence. &#34;Whatever you&#39;ve got to say-say it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla gripped her cup, eyes lowering. Her voice trembled as she began. &#34;This morning, I planned to compete with my own skill. But before the contest even started, my sister came to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s gaze sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She told me she knew who my real parents were.&#34; Leyla&#39;s fingers tightened around the glass. &#34;You know l was adopted and when she returned to the family, I was cast out. I begged her for answers about my parents, and she said if I wanted the truth, I had to follow her plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shaky breath before continuing. &#34;She forced me to copy her brother&#39;s painting-the champion,Carl Murray. That&#39;s why I did it. I never wanted to plagiarize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin studied her closely, his tone edged with doubt. &#34;You expect me to believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Think about it. Carl himself was competing. If I copied his work, wouldn&#39;t I just be digging my own grave? Why would I set myself up to be humiliated like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s expression darkened, deep lnes carving across his face. If she was telling the truth, then she wasn&#39;t the sole culprit-she had been cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then something clicked in his mind. Eliana Murray and Carl Murray Both had the surname Murray.His eyes narrowed.Could it be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His curiosity piqued, Davin asked Leyla, &#34;What is your sister&#39;s name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana Murray.&#34; Leyla blurted. &#34;You saw her today-she&#39;s always beside Carl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.A heavy,suffocating silence. Davin&#39;s gaze snapped to her, sharp and cutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stomach churned with disbelief. While he had been listening with patience, she had dared spin such a massive lie? If Eliana weren&#39;t his teacher, he might&#39;ve bought Leyla&#39;s story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped low. &#34;Are you absolutely sure everything you just said is true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla caught the odd glint in his eyes but pushed on, nodding furiously. &#34;I swear on my life. Everything I said is the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her words only deepened the look on Davin&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low chuckle. &#34;Leyla, do you know what my biggest regret latelyis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked at him, startled.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking you as my student.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in disbelief.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked like a whip. &#34;I must&#39;ve been out of my mind to take in someone who fabricates lies so easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please, I&#39;m not lying. Everything I told you is true! You know my past, don&#39;t you?&#34; A thousand retorts surged in Davin&#39;s mind, but he bit them back. He knew his teacher too well. This nonsense about a vicious sister and being cast out-it didn&#39;t deserve his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. From now on, we have no connection. Don&#39;t dare say you are my student again. If you do, l&#39;ll take legaI action.&#34; He rose to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through Leyla, and she grabbed his sleeve. &#34;You really don&#39;t believe me? I swear I was forced-Eliana threatened me, that&#39;s why I plagiarized Carl&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; The words thundered out, followed by the sharp crack of his palm against her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla staggered, her ears ringing. Through the haze of pain, she still caught his furious voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lie to me if you want-I don&#39;t care. But you will never slander my teacher!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest heaved, anger boiling. In that instant, Tristan&#39;s coldness toward Leyla came back to him, and Eliana&#39;s pointed words when Leyla tried to force her off the judging panel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he hadn&#39;t understood. But now he did. He was truly losing clarity. To have taken someone like Leyla as his latest student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s head snapped up, her face pale with shock. &#34;Your teacher? When did I ever slander your teacher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin let out a cold sneer. &#34;It seems you still don&#39;t know. That so-called &#39;vicious sister&#39; of yours... is my teacher Riley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes bulged in shock. &#34;You&#39;re saying Eliana is Riley? That&#39;s impossible! You must be mistaken!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; He let out a cold snort. &#34;I could be wrong about any other matter, but not this.&#34;</p>
