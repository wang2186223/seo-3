                <p>A woman climbed out of the taxi and approached the main house,wrapped in worn-out clothes. The jacket caught the most attention, covered in mismatched patches that made the wearer look like someone barely hanging on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry stared, stunned. Since when did beggars start showing up in taxis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla caught the odd look on his face and, curious,followed where he was staring. Her eyes narrowed the moment she recognized the newcomer. &#34;Why is it you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s mind immediately jumped to the same conclusion: the Murrays must have sent Eliana to plead with her to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected this day might come, though she hadn&#39;t thought it would happen so qquickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the family had already fallen on hard times, it made sense they would track her down after hearing she was with Hector. In their minds, she figured, maybe she could be convinced to help them. The same people who had told her to leave now wanted her back? Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened. She moved to block Eliana&#39;s way.&#34;Leave. Tell Mom I&#39;m done with all of you. Don&#39;t ever show your face to me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana met Leyla&#39;s gaze with an unreadable calm,her eyes as steady as if carved from glass. &#34;That woman isn&#39;t your mother anymore. You should call her Mrs.Murray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short laugh escaped Leyla, laced with scorn.&#34;That&#39;s rich, coming from a country bumpkin with no sense of manners. Is this your idea of asking for help? Relax, I&#39;m not about to fight you for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, Leyla had no desire to tangle with the Murray family now.Competing with some rustic nobody for anyone&#39;s favor? The thought alone was laughable.&#34;Before | decide you&#39;ve worn out my patience, get out of my sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t come here for you,&#34; Eliana said, a faint smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Then what are you doing here? Don&#39;t tell me the Murrays sent you running to the Clarkes for charity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea was absurd. Once fierce rivals, the Clarke and Murray families had never wasted a breath on kindness toward each other. With the Murrays in hot water, the Clarke family would be the last to lend a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s face didn&#39;t change. &#34;My reasons aren&#39;t yours to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance at Leyla, she wvalked straight toward Terry. &#34;I&#39;m here for Miguel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla darted in, yanking her back with a hard grip.&#34;Are you deaf, or just delusional? You think y/ou can waltz in and meet Miguel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel&#39;s condition was so critical that even Leyla struggled to get a moment with him. The idea of Eliana gaining access was laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flickered in Eliana&#39;s eyes. &#34;Move aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s laugh was edged with venom. &#34;By all means,go ahead. Let&#39;s see if Miguel will bother with you.And if you step through that door today, I&#39;ll eat my hat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Eliana&#39;s lips as she turned to Terry. &#34;Tell your master the doctor he&#39;s been seeking has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Terry like a slap. He stared, wide-eyed.&#34;Wait... you&#39;re the healer we have been hunting down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on, and make sure they come out to bring me in themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confidence in her voice made Terry think twice about brushing her off. If she truly was the doctor the Clarkes had been chasing for, turning her away could be a costly mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started toward the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight jolted Leyla into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana might be unfazed, but Leyla&#39;s nerves were already fraying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Clarkes barely tolerated her as it was, and if Eliana tricked them, their fury would inevitably land on her. The thought was enough to send her lunging forward to grab Terry&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Don&#39;t be fooled,Terry. She&#39;s the long-lost daughter of the Murray couple-disappeared over twenty years ago and just turned up in some backwater village. She&#39;s no miracle doctor. Let her in and, when the Clarkes find out, they&#39;ll be furious at both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s brows shot up. &#34;She&#39;s from the Murray family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it that the Murray couple once  lost their beloved youngest daughter, a tragedy that left Stella in pieces and pushed Louis to bring Leyla into their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had Terry imagined that very woman would be standing before him now... and in such worn, pitiful clothes that spoke volumes about how far the Murrays had fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s her,&#34; Leyla said with a sharp nod. &#34;The family sent her here for some scheme. Don&#39;t believe a word she says.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate the warning,&#34; Terry replied. &#34;I nearly let her fool me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze cut toward Eliana, turning cold. &#34;Leave.Now. Or I&#39;ll have you dragged out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s smile was almost mocking. &#34;So you&#39;re certain? No chance you&#39;ll regret this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to regret? No one from the Murray family is welcome here!&#34; He hesitated, then glanced at Leyla. &#34;Of course, that doesn&#39;t apply to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Leyla said evenly. &#34;I&#39;ve cut ties with them completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a low grunt, Terry faced Eliana again. &#34;Well,Miss? Will you walk out on your own, or should I make the choice for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done here.&#34; Eliana spun on her heel and walked off, already pulling out her phone. &#34;Seth, tell the Clarke family their butler refused to let me in. The contract is void. And the deposit stays with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding me?&#34; Seth&#39;s voice shot up in disbelief.&#34;They bent over backwards to get through to the Onyx Syndicate. You wouldn&#39;t have taken this case yourself if it weren&#39;t for the publicity in Qidence.And now they won&#39;t even let you inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood. I&#39;ll deliver the news right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending the call, Eliana slowed her pace, letting her eyes wander over the brilliant red maples blazing through the pristine neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her taxi was long gone, so the only choice was to walk to the gates before flagging down another ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the house&#39;s door, Terry&#39;s eyes followed her receding figure, an uneasy weight settling in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Leyla the moment Eliana was gone. At least she wouldn&#39;t be left holding the blame this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Louis to steady them, she believed the Murray famnily must have lost every shred of sense,sending some country woman to stir trouble at the Clarke estate. Did they honestly believe the Clarke family were people they could toy with now? The Clarkes had already shown more restraint than expected by not crushing the Murrays when they had the chance, yet here they showed up uninvited. It was reckless to the point of stupidity. No surprise the family would collapse once Louis was taken away-without him, they were hopeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla believed cutting all ties with the Murray family had been the smartest thing she&#39;d ever done; staying connected would have dragged her straight into their ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden bang of hinges snapped her from her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door flew open, and Leyla&#39;s head turned instinctively. Hector&#39;s parents, Jeffry and Ruby Clarke, rushed out, urgency written in every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face brightened in an instant, her greeting poised on her lips, but Jeffry brushed past her with a forceful shove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She staggered, catching herself just before she lost her footing. When she turned, Jeffry was already sweeping the surroundings with a sharp, urgent gaze, clearly looking for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt shot through her chest. Could it be...</p>
