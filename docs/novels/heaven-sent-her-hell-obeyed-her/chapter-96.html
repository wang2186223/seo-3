                <p>Carl seemed to read Eliana&#39;s thoughts, giving her a quick nod before speaking into the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,Mom.Lia and I are heading back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Stella&#39;s voice crackled through the line, then the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the brief silence that followed, Eliana&#39;s mind spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already met four of the six sons of Stella and Louise, each with such distinct personalities that it felt like meeting characters from different worlds. But Rowell remained a mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his excellent qualifications, he had been reduced to a nobody in the entertainment industry because of a woman. Would he be bitter like Damon, wearing his frustration like a cloak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell old than you?&#34;she asked suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but he&#39;s younger than Damon and Sawyer. He and Harold are twins,&#34; Carl replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harold? You mean the one doing medical aid abroad?&#34; she pressed further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Carl gave her a half-smile, though there was something wistful in his tone. &#34;You don&#39;t remember?Back when we were kids, whenever we went out together, people couldn&#39;t take their eyes off them. They were so identical. They always took the spotlight after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana chuckled. &#34;Well, 1 honestly don&#39;t remember having twin brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because you were too young. Besides, Mom carries the twin gene. She even has a twin sister, but...well, her side of the family cut ties with us long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice dropped. He shot her a sly glance. &#34;Which means, Lia... if you ever have kids, you might give birth to twins too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shook her head instantly. &#34;No, thank you. I don&#39;t want that many children.&#34; Her mother believed in large families-equating noise with happiness, children with prosperity. And in her pursuit of a daughter, Stella had ended up with far too many births.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana never shared that belief. Besides... she never wanted to get married, let alone start a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing so many different kinds of people, she found being single cleaner, freer-better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl, of course, saw things differently. &#34;Having lots of children makes a family lively and warm-just like ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana shot him a sideways glance, lips curling into a wry smile. &#34;Easy for you to say. You men don&#39;t have to give birth. Of course, you think it&#39;s wonderful. Look at Mom-her body is frail now because she had too many children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made Carl pause. Slowly, he nodded, his expression sobering. &#34;That&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car grew quiet for a moment, the hum of the road filling the space. Then Carl broke it with a question that had been gnawing at him. &#34;Lia, where did you learn your medical skills and painting? You... you seem to master everything effortlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana raised an eyebrow, turning the question back on him. &#34;Where did you learn to paint?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl narrowed his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t change the subject. I&#39;m serious. Where did you learn all these things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a teasing smile. &#34;From parallel universes. Can you believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl scoffed outright. &#34;If you don&#39;t want to tell me, just admit it. Don&#39;t try to fool me with nonsense. I&#39;m not that gullible. I&#39;m actually pretty smart,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana chuckled softly but didn&#39;t explain further. She wasn&#39;t lying. She had indeed learned her skills from parallel uuniverses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was fourteen, she had run away from her village to survive on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fateful night, with nowhere to go and a snowstorm raging, she had nearly frozen to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when the &#34;System&#34; had found her. Dragged into a parallel universe, she had been forced to complete bizarre tasks in exchange for her survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every world demanded something new of her-medicine, art, strategy, performance. She had learned each skill under the harshest conditions, her life always hanging by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Task after task. World after world. A hundred universes. A hundred different lives. Until, finally, she returned.Alive.Changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had gone through too much to waste her hard-earned abilities. That was why she founded the Onyx Syndicate, built from the countlessskills she had acquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one could ever believe her real story. So, she told a simpler one-that she had trained under many masters, each teaching her something different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a lie. In those parallel worlds, she had indeed apprenticed under countless teachers-men and women who had stood as the very pinnacles of their realms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,they reached home. Eliana pushed the thoughts aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the living room, she half-expected to see a man as strikingly handsome as Carl or her other brothers.Instead, her eyes landed on a woman-a radiant beauty wwith golden, wavy hair, her arm linked with Stella&#39;s as they chatted warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be Rowell&#39;s girlfriend? Confused, Eliana scanned the room. No unfamiliar man. Only Damon and Sawyer were there, both wearing the same look of weary resignation as their eyes rested on the blonde.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,welcome home! Come here, darling.&#34; Stella spotted her at once, her smile widening as she waved her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana nodded politely and walked over with Carl at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, who is this?&#34; she asked, curiosity slipping into her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s smile softened. She glanced at the blonde beauty beside her, then shook her head with amusement.&#34;This is Rowell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana froze. Her eyes widened, and she blurted out, &#34;Rowell??&#34; &#34;Hi, Lia!&#34; the blonde replied cheerfully-only, the voice was unmistakably male.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes widened even further. Rowell...a cross-dresser?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the shock written across her face, Rowell quickly abandoned the act. He tugged off the wig and stood up in haste, his smile apologetic. &#34;Lia, don&#39;t misunderstand. It&#39;s not what you think. I just came back from a film set. I didn&#39;t even get the chance to remove the makeup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Eliana. So this wasn&#39;t some strange hobby-it was work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl chuckled,punching Rowell lightly on the chest. &#34;Rowell, what the hell were you filming? I didn&#39;t even recognize you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell shrugged,though the motion seemed more bitter than casual. &#34;It&#39;s work. One of the actresses for a minor role quit suddenly, and my agent shoved me into the part. It was smaIl anyway-I&#39;ve already finished filming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, however, didn&#39;t miss the flicker in his eyes. That smile might have looked careless, but the frustration hidden behind it was sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No decent agent would force a male actor into such a role unless there was someone pulling strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana was sure that it must be related to Paula.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning innocence, she stepped forward and extended her hand. &#34;Welcome home, Rowell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell wipedhis hand before taking hers, a faint smile tugging at his lips. &#34;I should be the one saying that.Welcome home,Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,as though suddenly remembering something, he reached into his backpack and pulled out a stack of glossy photographs. Each one bore the signature of a popular celebrity. &#34;Young girls love stars these days.I didn&#39;t know who you liked, so after I heard you were coming back, I collected as many autographs as I could for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana accepted the hefty bundle. The weight alone told her how much effort he had gone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowell wasn&#39;t doing well in the industry. For him to gather signatures from so many celebrities must be no easy task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana wasn&#39;t even a fan of celebrities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in that moment, these autographs became precious to her-not because of whose names were scrawled on them, but because of who had collected them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Rowell. I love them,&#34; she said with a bright smile. Already, her mind was moving ahead, mapping the solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most people, fixing his situation would have been close to impossible. But for her? It was just a small problem. One she could solve inthree days.</p>
