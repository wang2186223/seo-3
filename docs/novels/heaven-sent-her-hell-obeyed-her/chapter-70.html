                <p>Uncertainty clouded Eliana&#39;s features, but Rocco gave her a reassuring nod. &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry. Mr.Pearson and I can handle things from here. Go take care of that burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief, faint but real, flickered across Eliana&#39;s face as she let Doran lead her away. Every few steps, she glanced back, clearly reluctant to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Eliana retreat only fueled Celine&#39;s growing rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scheming had always been Celine&#39;s specialty, yet somehow the tables had turned, leaving her looking foolish in front of everyone-all because of Eliana,whom she&#39;d never taken seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boiling over,Celine lost her composure and screamed,&#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere! Get back here and clear my name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Momentum carried her forward, ready to chase Eliana down, but Rupert&#39;s hand clamped onto her arm and held her in place. A harsh yank pulled her back. &#34;Stay put!&#34; Eyes wide with shock, Celine spun to face her father.&#34;Dad, are you doubting me now? You really believe that bumpkin instead of your own daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rupert could gather a reply, Tristan moved in with cool confidence,cutting off the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mayor Oliver, you owe me answers. Your daughter has been mistreating my fiancée. If word gets out,how do you expect me to protect my reputation?&#34; he said,voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm gathered behind Rupert&#39;s eyes as the reality of the situation hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Navigating politics had always come easily, but this kind of direct challenge from someone so much younger was entirely new-and infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; His instinct was to push back, but the words caught in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raised hand from Tristan cut him off before another word could leave his lips. Tristan said coolly, &#34;Let&#39;s put my reputation aside, shall we? This mess isn&#39;t just my problem-you&#39;re the one in hot water if this goes public. As mayor, you&#39;re supposed to set an example.If people find out your daughter&#39;s been throwing your name around to scare people, your bosses upstairs won&#39;t be happy. You know that as well as I do.&#34; A few carefully chosen words from Tristan left Rupert reeling, his confidence knocked sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People whispered that Tristan was young, but everyone knew he could take complaints to the top with a single call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That understanding crept across Rupert&#39;s face,darkening his mood. The threat was clear. No comeback would save him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the crowd, some faces like Hector&#39;s lingered hopefully,angling for Rupert&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, a larger group began drifting toward Tristan&#39;s side,eager for any chance to win his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ripples of agreement moved through the gathering,as more voices chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mayor Oliver, maybe it&#39;s time to set some boundaries with your daughter,&#34; one person suggested, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re all professionals here. It&#39;s bad form to drag personal drama into the open,&#34; another echoed,glancing around for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others played both sides, dropping flattering remarks that still pushed Rupert into a corner. &#34;Oh, let&#39;s not get carried away. He knows better than to let things  get out of hand. He&#39;d never excuse something like this from his daughter. Am I right,Mayor Oliver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm brewed in Rupert&#39;s eyes as he faced the chorus of opinions. &#34;All of you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,when he caught the steely, expectant gazes all around him, any harsh retort died on his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling himself, he exhaled slowly and looked to Tristan. &#34;You seem to have a better handle on this than anyone, Tristan. What&#39;s your suggestion for settling things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Tristan answered, &#34;To start, an apology from Ms. Oliver seems fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage threatened to boil over in Celine, her temples pulsing with frustration. &#34;I&#39;ve told you already! I did not throw coffee at her! I&#39;m not about to say sorry for something I didn&#39;t do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes narrowed, curiosity coloring his voice.&#34;Are you sure about that? You all call Eliana a country girl-simple, honest, the kind who stops to help a stranger on the street. Lying just isn&#39;t in her nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Celine had mocked Eliana&#39;s rural upbringing,so Tristan decided to turn those words back on her,probing with a measured tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned for a split second, Celine&#39;s expression grew  stormy, but she refused to back down. &#34;That wasn&#39;t me! | wouldn&#39;t throw coffee at her with half the city watching. I&#39;m not reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Advancing a step, Tristan refused to let her off the hook. &#34;Is that really the story you&#39;re sticking to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand pressed to her chest, Celine insisted, &#34;I give you my word-I did nothing wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, amused laugh escaped Tristan. &#34;If that&#39;s how you want it, I&#39;ll accept this as nothing more than a misunderstanding. Eliana isn&#39;t one to carry grudges over something so trivial. However...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching to a more deliberate tone, Tristan continued,&#34;You know, h entire world revolves around her family.She might joke about little things, but she&#39;d never lie about something as serious as her father&#39;s troubles.According to her, you dangled Mr. Murray&#39;s predicament over her head. Are you really going to claim she made that up? In the end, she&#39;s just a girl from the countryside-she wouldn&#39;t know a mayor from a city councilman, let alone play games with power. The idea that she&#39;s inventing this is a stretch,don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine&#39;s posture went rigid, her fists knotting in the fabric of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only a moment&#39;s hesitation, she forced her  expression back to cool defiance. &#34;That&#39;s not true.I never threatened her,&#34; she declared,voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, that split-second flicker of panic didn&#39;t escape anyone. The room was full of skilled players;none were fooled by her sudden composure. People exchanged knowing glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Mayor Oliver, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re overwhelmed with public business, but some matters at home require attention too.Words tossed carelessly can bring a world of trouble. You&#39;re well aware of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Rupert&#39;s forehead twitched, and he fought to keep his frustration in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched, he pinned Celine with a hard look.&#34;You&#39;re going to apologize to Tristan-right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride wouldn&#39;t let her budge. Not even a crack appeared in her mask. Celine simply stared straight ahead,refusing to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stubborn glare fixed on her face, Celine retorted,&#34;Absolutely not! I refuse to apologize. Eliana Murry is making all of this up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger threatened to boil over.Knowing how much the Murray family meant to Eliana, she quietly hatched a plan-maybe she could convince her dad to make Louis&#39;s time behind bars even harder, just to get even. Rupert&#39;s patience ran thin. &#34;I&#39;m not asking again.Apologize-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and wounded pride tangled in Celine&#39;s voice as she bit down on her words. &#34;I&#39;m telling the truth,Dad.Please don&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rupert wouldn&#39;t let her finish. &#34;If you won&#39;t do it,then I will. Clearly, this is on me-I must have failed somewhere as a father for you to act this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention to Tristan, Rupert straightened his jacket and spoke with a forced smile. &#34;Tristan,let&#39;s put this incident behind us for my sake. I&#39;m willing to take responsibility and consider it resolved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad...&#34; A strangled protest caught in Celine&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed in her eyes; having Rupert apologize for her was even more humiliating than doing it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a chance to interrupt again, Rupert continued,&#34;To make amends, I&#39;ll see that Ms. Murray receives ten times the medical costs, plus something extra for the trouble we&#39;ve caused. And I&#39;ll apologize to her personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert lowered his head, humility heavy in his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him,Tristan stayed perfectly composed,offering no sign of forgiveness. &#34;Bankruptcy or not, the Murray family have me behind them now. They won&#39;t ever go hungry,&#34; he said coolly. &#34;Keep your compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan dismissed Rupert&#39;s attempt at an apology with a wave of his hand, and the mayor&#39;s expression grew darker by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet cornered by circumstance, Rupert had no other cards left to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brand-new mayor couldn&#39;t afford to make an enemy of someone like Tristan-his every move was under a microscope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Searching for a solution, Rupert&#39;s voice broke through the tension. &#34;Just tell me what you want, Tristan. How do we put an end to this? Is it an apology you want-or are you expecting me to humble myself right here and now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celine,watching the exchange, could hardly keep her anxiety in check. &#34;Dad,please-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rupert cut her off sharply, his patience gone,exclaiming, &#34;Enough out of you! You&#39;ve made things bad enough already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any protest Celine might have made died on her lips,forced into silence by her father&#39;s glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, knowing grin touched Tristan&#39;s mouth as he  replied,&#34;No one here expects you to grovel. Eliana would never want to see something so humiliating-she&#39;s not that kind of person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow crept across Rupert&#39;s features as he pressed for clarity. &#34;Then tell me, what exactly do you want from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching one brow, Tristan answered with calm certainty, &#34;Honestly, Eliana isn&#39;t worried about herself.Her main concern is what happens to her father. In light of everything that happened today-if you&#39;re hoping to ease her mind and also protect your own standing-there&#39;s a straightforward fix. I hope you can step away from his case entirely. Assign it to someone impartial and let them handle it from now on. It&#39;s the safest move for everyone, and it spares you any future whispers or doubts about your involvement.Wouldn&#39;t you agree that&#39;s the best solution?&#34;</p>
