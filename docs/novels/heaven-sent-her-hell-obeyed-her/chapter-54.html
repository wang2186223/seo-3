                <p>The door eased open, and standing there was Eliana herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her white gown caught the light, its soft shimmer giving her the delicate beauty of a white rose in full bloom.Yet beneath that elegance lurked a sharpness that warned against getting too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Tristan wouldn&#39;t dare get too close to someone like her, not when one glance could cut him to the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, come over here,&#34; Stella called out, beckoning her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom...&#34; Eliana stepped forward, her eyes sliding warily toward Tristan before shifting to Stella. &#34;Ashley told me you were feeling tired and went upstairs to rest, but when I checked, you weren&#39;t there... I didn&#39;t expect to find you here instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smile, Stella tugged her down beside her. &#34;Tristan&#39;s mother and I were very close. Since it&#39;s not often we run into each other, we decided to catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can catch up anytime,&#34; said Eliana, her smile polite but thin.&#34;Still, you&#39;ve had a long day. You should be resting upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint ache in Stella&#39;s lower back reminded her that Eliana was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied that she&#39;d said all she needed, she nodded. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll head up now. See Tristan out for me later,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Eliana replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ashley arrived to escort Stella away, the pleasant curve of Eliana&#39;s lips disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fixed on Tristan, her voice level. &#34;What exactly did you two talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s fingers idly rotated the coffee cup in his hand. &#34;Nothing important-just setting the record straight on a few things.&#34; &#34;What exactly?&#34; she asked, her tone pressing for detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met hers with a deliberate steadiness. &#34;Some misunderstandings. Between you and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elíana continued to ask, &#34;And what misunderstandings would those be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, for starters... the idea that I already have a girlfriend,&#34; Tristan said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brow knit in displeasure. &#34;You do have a girlfriend, so what&#39;s there to misinterpret? I&#39;m well aware you only came near me to help with your father&#39;s injury. Don&#39;t worry-I gave my word, and I won&#39;t take it back. But I&#39;d appreciate it if you stopped feeding my mother stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tilted his head slightly. &#34;What stories did I supposedly tell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How should I know every word you said?&#34; she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t know, then what makes you so sure I said anything untrue to your mom?&#34; Tristan asked, his tone calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; The word slipped out, but she quickly clamped down, reminding herself it wasn&#39;t worth sparring with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow breath steadied her before she asked, &#34;Forget everything else-did you mention the Fist Guild incident to my mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised an eyebrow lightly. &#34;Now that you&#39;ve brought it up, I realize I haven&#39;t told her yet. Maybe I should let her know how her daughter took on the entire Fist Guild members alone. That way, she won&#39;t lose sleep worrying about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he rose from his seat, she felt a spike of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot out to grab his sleeve, but the pull came too strong.Fabric slid under her grip, nearly yanking half his jacket off. A button popped from the black shirt beneath, revealing the lean line of his collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen, she released him at once. &#34;I... didn&#39;t mean to do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze held no trace of anger-only a slow, knowing smile. &#34;We may have an engagement arranged back when we were children but there&#39;s really no need to rush. Some things are better when the timing is right, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he even talking about? Eliana could barely process the absurdity of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed her face as she said, &#34;I already said it wasn&#39;t intentional. Now put your jacket back on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of anyone walking in and seeing them like this made her stomach knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, on the other hand, seemed entirely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of my shirt buttons just came off,&#34; he remarked casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; Eiana asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re going to sew it back on. Otherwise, if someone catches a glimpse, my good name will be ruined,&#34;Tristan replied without a hint of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, Eliana demanded, &#34;What &#39;good name&#39; are you even worried about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My standing as a respectable, unattached man,&#34; Tristan answered seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands curled into fists as she forced herself to stay calm. &#34;Fine. Just stay here. I&#39;ll go get Ashley,&#34; she said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t. If she hears about it, that so-called good name of mine will be finished anyway,&#34; Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She isn&#39;t the type to gossip. And besides, nothing happened between us. There&#39;s no risk of a misunderstanding,&#34; Eliana reassured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you truly certain you&#39;re not worried about mjsunderstandings?&#34; He leaned back slightly, eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his look made her feel he was quietly scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she held his gaze and said evenly,&#34;Absolutely certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine then, forget the sewing. I&#39;ll just head straight to your mom and share how fearlessly you handled yourself, so she never needs to worry about anyone pushing you around again,&#34; Tristan said with a slow nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of alarm shot through Eliana. &#34;You can&#39;t tell her anything! Not a word about the Fist Guild,and definitely not about Sean&#39;s injury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Tristan raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose I can keep that a secret</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but ony if you do something for me in return. Seems fair, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing her voice to stay even, she asked, &#34;What is it you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing complicated,&#34; Tristan replied. &#34;The Pearson Group is holding a charity exhibition in a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;ll be several famous paintings on display, and I need someone to attend with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit together. &#34;You mean you want me to go as your date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look at that. You have beauty and brains. You&#39;re spot on,&#34; Tristan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small step closed the distance between them. &#34;By the way, can I call you Eliana?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The request was ordinary, but when he spoke her name,the warmth in his voice unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin even prickled with goosebumps. &#34;You&#39;d better stick with Ms. Murray!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curved slightly. &#34;Strange, I&#39;m starting to think &#39;Eliana&#39; has a nice ring to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became painfully clear to her that in a battle of words, he was far too skilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she let the fight drop altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply said, &#34;Call me whatever you want! But if you expect me to go with you to this exhibition, what about your supposed girlfriend? Shouldn&#39;t she be the one on your arm? Or are you not worried she&#39;ll be furious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s expression stayed calm. &#34;I don&#39;t have a girlfriend, so there&#39;s nothing to fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together. &#34;Afraid to admit it? What happens when she hears you denying her existence-do you think she&#39;ll just smile and let it slide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan was utterly confused. &#34;Who exactly told you l have one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did,&#34; Eliana replied matter-of-factly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who is this mysterious &#39;she&#39;?&#34; Tristan pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your girlfriend,&#34; she answered without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like | said, I don&#39;t have a girlfriend...&#34; Tristan realized that they were going in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand dragged across his forehead before he muttered, &#34;Whoever planted that idea in your head was wrong. It&#39;s nothing but gossip. I&#39;ve never been involved with anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed on him. &#34;You almost sound proud of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t a spotless reputation be worth some pride?&#34; Tristan retorted smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,whatever. I&#39;ll go. But you have to keep your mouth shut around my mom. Her health isn&#39;t that good,and the last thing she needs is bad news. That means nothing about Sean, and nothing about the Fist Guild,&#34; she said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan replied earnestly, &#34;If you show up as promised, you have my word-not a single word will escape me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;ll agree, but make sure you set things straight with your girlfriend. I don&#39;t need drama, and I won&#39;t stand for being accused of something I didn&#39;t do,&#34; Eliana warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again-I really don&#39;t have a girlfriend,&#34; Tristan remarked with a sigh</p>
