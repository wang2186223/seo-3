                <p>Eliana leaned forward, her posture stiff with focus.&#34;What is it you need to tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s lips parted, but she paused, as though every word had to be weighed before release. &#34;I&#39;ve arranged a marriage for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock hit instantly-Eliana&#39;s head lifted, her gaze locking on her mother in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several seconds ticked by before she could speak.&#34;Mom... I&#39;ve barely come home, and you&#39;re already pushing me into marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow feeling settled in her chest. Was this just like Janessa all over again-someone who saw her as a responsibility to pass off rather than family to cherish? If so, she would walk away without hesitation. But then Stella&#39;s eyes glistened with unshed tears. &#34;I wish I could keep you here with me longer. You&#39;ve heard enough to know our situation is dangerous.I may not be able to protect you much longer... sol need to find someone who can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned, quiet but sure-Stella wasn&#39;t trying to get rid of her; she was trying to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s expression softened, and she reached for her mother&#39;s hand. &#34;You don&#39;t have to do this for me.I can stand on my own. I don&#39;t need a man to keep me safe or give me a good life. I can manage that myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella shook her head slowly. &#34;It&#39;s more complicated than you think. Your dad&#39;s been taken in for investigation. Someone is working against us, and our company&#39;s been dragged into it as well. The only way I&#39;ll be at peace is if someone powerful is there to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Murray household was already walking a tightrope, and Eliana&#39;s sudden return had never been part of the plan. For Stella, keeping her safe became  the first priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a crease forming between her brows, Eliana asked, &#34;Who&#39;s really pulling the strings against us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a single enemy,&#34; Stella replied, her tone unyielding. &#34;There&#39;s more than one person waiting to see our family collapse. Their influence runs deep-far deeper than anything your dad or I can counter.I can&#39;t promise you&#39;ll be untouched, so you have to trust me on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom...&#34; Eliana&#39;s voice wavered with hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing a steadying hand over her daughter&#39;s, Stella said, &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry. The man I chose for you is decent. He&#39;s the head of the Pearson family in Eighvale-young, accomplished, and more than capable. I made a verbal agreement with the Pearsons for you years ago, and they just confirmed it. The engagement will be made officialthis month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The head of the Pearson family? You mean...Jermaine?&#34; Eliana asked, her voice tightening. A flicker of surprise crossed Stella&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;ve met him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to give herself away, Eliana kept her tone casual. &#34;Carl mentioned a few prominent names on the way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella seemed satisfied with that answer. &#34;He pays attention, I&#39;ll give him that. But it isn&#39;t Jermaine I&#39;ve chosen. It&#39;s another Pearson son-Tristan. His background has its complications, but from everything l&#39;ve learned, he&#39;s trustworthy. More importantly, he carries the Pearson name, and no one would dare cross him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name gave Eliana pause. She knew almost nothing about this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her mind drifted to the young man she&#39;d encountered at the Clarkes&#39; estate earlier. Could they be one and the same? She distinctly remembered hearing someone address him as Mr.Pearson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the next few days, I&#39;ll set up a meeting between you two,&#34; Stella continued. &#34;Spend some time with  him. If he doesn&#39;t suit you, I&#39;ll look for another option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Stella doubted she could find anyone as solid and untouchable as Tristan right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry,&#34; Stella said with quiet resolve. &#34;This engagement is only a safeguard. Once your dad gets through this storm, and if you still feel nothing for Tristan, I&#39;ll end it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s lips curved into a strained smile, her words ready on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the door opened, and Jordy stepped in. &#34;Mrs.Murray, we&#39;ve got a problem. A group is here claiming the estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s expression hardened instantly. &#34;Claiming it?On what grounds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re saying the property was forcibly mortgaged and that we have three days to clear out,&#34; Jordy explained grimly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp edge entered Stella&#39;s voice. &#34;That&#39;s  impossible. Even if the company went bankrupt, this estate was never mortgaged. What right do they have to take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not certain,&#34; Jordy admitted. &#34;But I checked the paperwork-it&#39;s stamped with the court&#39;s seal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella made to rise from the bed, but Eliana placed a firm hand on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you&#39;re still recovering. Let Carl and me handle this,&#34; Eliana said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure the two of you can manage?&#34; Stella asked,her worry plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we can&#39;t, I&#39;ll call you right away,&#34; Eliana replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Stella responded. &#34;Jordy, take Carl and Sean with you-and make sure Eliana isn&#39;t harmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t yet realize Sean was nowhere in the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do,&#34; Jordy said without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana kept close behind as they made their way downstairs. The moment they stepped into the living room, the air was heavy with tension-Carl stood rigid, locked in a standoff with three men in tailored suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my home,&#34; Carl snapped, his voice sharp with anger. &#34;You have no right to seize it. Leave now,or I&#39;ll have the police here in minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man at the front let out a cold, derisive laugh.&#34;Still in the dark about your own situation, I see. lf you want to play tough, then forget the three days-we&#39;ll have you out before the sun goes down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl snapped, fury rising fast, &#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words could leave his mouth, Eliana stepped forward, positioning herself squarely between him and the intruders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was calm but carried an edge. &#34;Show me the contract. I want to see exactly what you&#39;re basing this on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, something like admiration flickered in the leader&#39;s eyes, but it vanished beneath a stony mask. &#34;And who might you be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m part of the family,&#34; Eliana said evenly. &#34;That gives me every right to examine your contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow arched, the man in front flicked the document toward her. &#34;Be my guest. Read every line if you want. It&#39;s all there-your property was sold under a court order, and my boss already owns it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother engaging with his smugness,her attention fixed on the pages in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The court&#39;s seal was authentic, and the wording was crystal clear-the estate had been mortgaged,seized, and auctioned off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The winning bid? A meager ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl leaned in to read over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His temper snapped as he scanned the text. &#34;We never mortgaged this property/! We didn&#39;t even know it went to auction. Who the hell are you people, and who signed off on this?&#34; &#34;Not our problem,&#34; the man said flatly. &#34;We followed legal procedure and bought it fair and square. Our boss just isn&#39;t fond of the small house to the west.Move out peacefully, and you can live there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice rose into a roar. &#34;Bastard! That&#39;s where we keep the dogs! You&#39;re telling us to live in a kennel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it or leave it,&#34; the man scoffed. &#34;A dog house is us being generous-otherwise, the street&#39;s always an option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man let out a low, derisive laugh. &#34;Still clinging to the illusion that you&#39;re the old powerful Murray family? Your company&#39;s gone under,your kin are sitting in prison, and you think you can keep living in such an estate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Carl drew in a sharp breath, ready to fire back-but the sound of tires outside cut him short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the gates, several unfamiliar cars stood parked,and Sean came striding in, his gaze sweeping the room. He took in the tense standoff in seconds, his eyes locking on Eliana with a flash of hostility. &#34;This mess is on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s face hardened. &#34;Sean, if you&#39;re set on blaming someone, look at them-not Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean gave a cold snort. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t heard. She marched herself over to the Clarkes&#39;home and tried to con them. What&#39;s happening now is probably payback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Con?&#34; Carl turned toward Eliana. &#34;Lia, did you really go to the Clarkes&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; she said without hesitation. &#34;But I went to treat someone,not to cheat anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s voice firmed. &#34;You hear that? You jumped to conclusions. Apologize to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s temper flared. &#34;Apologize? I watched it happen with my own eyes. You&#39;d side with her-a woman who&#39;s barely stepped back into this family-over me, your own brother? She played the part of some famed doctor, and Miguel ended up coughing blood. That&#39;s why the Clarke family is retaliating. 1told her to apologize, and instead she ran back here acting like she&#39;s done nothing wrong. Don&#39;t let her fool you.&#34;</p>
