                <p>Sean&#39;s last-recorded location might have been in the Fist Guild, but Eliana couldn&#39;t shake the knot of distrust tightening in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Damon,Sawyer, and Carl could find the silver lining in any situation, she had always braced herself for the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother fishing for rumors this time. Going straight to the Fist Guild seemed the quickest way to get answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The visit wasn&#39;t an impulsive decision. She had been waiting for the right moment to settle old grievances with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, the timing finally felt perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive over, she dialed Seth and said, &#34;I need the full layout of the Fist Guild. Send it to me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; replied Seth withouta hint of hesitation. He immediately started compiling the information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been preparing for a confrontation with the Fist Guild for quite a while, so most of the groundwork  was already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, Seth forwarded the map to her and added, &#34;We&#39;re still short on manpower in Qidence.Stay sharp. I&#39;ll have the rest move in faster to back you up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Eliana responded, ending the call as her attention locked on the digital layout glowing on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door to Tristan&#39;s office swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco strode in, his face set in stone. &#34;Sir, we&#39;ve got trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slid his pen onto the desk and leaned back in his chair. The black suit he wore was tailored to perfection, collar fastened all the way up,giving him an air of untouchable authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spit it out,&#34; he said, his tone calm but expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some thugs stormed our new place on Maple Street.They demanded we pay them protection fee.When our guys refused, two of them ended up in the hospital,&#34; said Rocco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Protection fee?&#34; Tristan let out a low,humorless chuckle, as though Rocco had just told the most absurd story. &#34;Who&#39;s stupid enough to try that?&#34; &#34;I checked. It&#39;s the Fist Guild. They were at our opening two days ago, but they left when they saw how many men we had on site,&#34; Rocco explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it&#39;s them.&#34; Tristan&#39;s eyes hardened, a dangerous glint flickering in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to involve the cops?&#34; asked Rocco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve already been told,&#34; Tristan remarked, his voice turning to ice. &#34;That was two days ago, and still nothing. Someone&#39;s protecting them from the inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed back his chair and rose without hesitation.&#34;Nothing on my plate this morning. I&#39;ll handle this in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the culprits with his own eyes mattered more than hearing secondhand reports. If the police were useless, he&#39;d make sure the matter was handled his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For months, he&#39;d been waiting for the right moment to wipe out the thugs plaguing Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Fist Guild&#39;s headquarters, Sean was strapped to a heavy, custom-built chair. His face was a swollen mess, a thin line of blood sliding from the corner of his mouth. Men in matching boxing uniforms formed a half-circle in front of him, though one figure in a tailored suit clearly didn&#39;t belong among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suited man&#39;s gaze was sharp and restless. &#34;Still not ready to talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, I didn&#39;t take anything!&#34; Sean&#39;s voice cracked under the pain, but he forced it louder.&#34;I&#39;ve never even laid eyes on the boxing manual you keep mentioning! Mr. Moore, you have to believe me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man was Flint Moore, the new leader of the Fist Guild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year ago, his father, Kohen Moore, had stepped down for health reasons,leaving Flint to take over the guild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never took it?&#34; Flint&#39;s laugh came out low and mocking, like he was humoring a child who thought lies could save him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the distance with a slow, almost pleasant smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes. Without warning,his hand fisted in Sean&#39;s short hair, yanking his head back before slamming it hard against the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crack of impact thudded through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black spots swam across Sean&#39;s vision, and for a moment, the world tilted toward unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The manual&#39;s gone missing, and you just happened to be there when it happened.&#34; Flint&#39;s voice was sharp enough to cut. &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb. Confess now, or you won&#39;t walk out of here breathing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean fought to draw air into his lungs, his ribs aching with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went into that jewelry store to buy something fancy for my sister,&#34; he muttered. &#34;I didn&#39;t even know it belonged to you. I never saw that manual you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint&#39;s jaw tightened, his patience clearly fraying.&#34;Slice the tendons in one of his arms. Let&#39;s see how long he keeps pretending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s stomach turned cold, his eyes flying wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guild he had once admired now stood ready to mutilate him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Flint-the man he had once respected-looked nothing short of ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare! I&#39;m a Murray!&#34; Sean&#39;s voice cracked between fury and disbelief. &#34;If you touch me,you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint&#39;s laugh was low and scornful. &#34;You think your  family still hold any weight? You&#39;re not even worth the dirt on my shoes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Sean&#39;s voice broke with rage, but Flint didn&#39;t let him finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still standing there? Cut the tendons,&#34;Flint snapped, his tone laced with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men shifted uneasily before speaking. &#34;Mr.Moore... he&#39;s still MAurray blood. Even if the family&#39;s lost their power, they&#39;ve still got a name people remember. If this turns ugly or the cops start sniffing around-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint&#39;s eyes turned to ice as he stepped closer. &#34;You&#39;re telling me a bankrupt family still makes you lose sleep at night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s head dropped instantly, his shoulders stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stop wasting my time. Do it,&#34; Flint instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; The reply came quick and clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Don&#39;t-&#34; Sean&#39;s voice cracked into desperation,but the iron restraints didn&#39;t budge. The chair held him in place like a vice, and every frantic twist only made the metal bite harder into his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two men moved in fast, their expressions unreadable as they closed the gap. One man pinned Sean&#39;s right hand to the armrest,while the other lifted a knife, its blade catching the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the strike could land, a sharp crack split the air -a small stone zipped in from the doorway, smashing into the knife and sending it spinning from the man&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Metal rang out as the blade slammed against the wall and skittered across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; Flint&#39;s voice dropped to an icy growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes snapped toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Framed by the light spilling in, a slim figure stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean followed their gaze, and when he made out her features, his breath caught. &#34;Lia? What the hell are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint&#39;s attention shifted, his gaze narrowing as the figure moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The newcomer was young, with skin as smooth as porcelain and long hair tumbling loosely over her shoulders,shifting with each step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her beauty was arresting, but it was the sharp glint in  her eyes-cold and cutting-that made the room feel a little smaller. Even the men in boxing uniforms found themselves avoiding her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia?&#34; Flint&#39;s gaze flicked from Sean back to the woman. &#34;So... you&#39;re Eliana.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint studied her face, catching the faint similarity between her and Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re his sister? Pretty little thing,&#34; he said,a greedy smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean shook himself free from the haze of shock. &#34;Lia!Get out of here! You can&#39;t be in this place-leave now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eliana didn&#39;t break stride. Her gaze stayed locked ahead, her steps unhurried, as though the chaos around her didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flint&#39;s grin widened, the gleam in his eyes shifting into something darker. &#34;Got some fire, haven&#39;t you? I like that. Say yes to me, and maybe your brother walks out of here in one piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, I&#39;m telling you-Run!&#34; Sean&#39;s voice cracked under the weight of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shout seemed to pull him backward through time,to days when a small girl with bright eyes and a sweet laugh would tug at his sleeve, calling his name like it was the only word she knew. That day, she had tugged on his sleeve, begging him to take her to watch the fireworks explode over the biggest river in Qidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the haze of his own amusement and carelessness,he had let go of her for just a moment-long enough to lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her disappearance had always fallen directly on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally came back, guilt and shame tangled together inside him, smothering any relief he might have felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, all he could do was wish he&#39;d been a better brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished he&#39;d never let his own fun take priority over keeping her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory burned sharper the more he thought about it, and the words ripped out of him before he could stop them. &#34;Lia, get out of here!&#34;</p>
