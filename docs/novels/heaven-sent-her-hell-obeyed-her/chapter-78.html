                <p>Eliana tilted her head slightly, her tone calm but firm.&#34;By the way, just call me Eliana from now on. I&#39;d rather people didn&#39;t know too much about who I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t living off her medical skills anymore, and the thought of strangers constantly showing up at her door was more nuisance than honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s lips curved in an easy smile. &#34;Alright. Eliana it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached back and gave Hector a light tug forward.&#34;Hector&#39;s been feeling bad ever since that day. Says he shouldn&#39;t have doubted you-let alone threatened you to treat his grandpa. He asked to come along today so he could apologize in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s eyes held a quiet intent. He wanted these two to at least be on civil terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,Hector had mentioned on the phone that Tristan had gone public, calling Eliana his fiancée. But Jeffry knew Elbert too well-profits first, always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Murray family was no longer what it had been now.No matter how gifted Eliana was as a healer, Elbert  would never welcome a daughter-in-law from such a fallen background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffery was certain Tristan and Eliana would eventually split. But he didn&#39;t mind Eliana&#39;s background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped Hector and Eliana could work out beautifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector swallowed, his voice low but earnest. &#34;Ms.Murray... I&#39;m really sorry. That day, I let my panic for my grandpa&#39;s health cloud my judgment. I spoke out of line and acted even worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s brows lifted, a faint, unreadable smile touching her lips. &#34;Quite a thoughtful grandson,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone made Hector feel it wasn&#39;t entirely a compliment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he forced a polite smile. &#34;Can you forgive me?Let&#39;s forget it ever happened. If you or your family ever need help, you can come to me anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana couldn&#39;t care less about his offer. She barely resisted the urge toroll her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the type to hold grudges over every little thing-some people, she could forgive easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there were others she knew from the first meeting she&#39;d never trust, let alone befriend. Hector fell squarely in that second category.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Murray and Clarke families weren&#39;t in the middle of smoothing things over, she wouldn&#39;t even be standing here entertaining his empty words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed Hector a stare, her expression unreadable.&#34;I&#39;ve got one principle-if people don&#39;t bother me,l don&#39;t bother them. But if someone crosses me,I don&#39;t let it slide. So, as long as you stay out of mmy way,I&#39;ll pretend nothing ever happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Hector like a sudden drop in temperature. Why was she so warm with his dad but cold towards him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dad had doubted her too, hadn&#39;t he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to reply, but a sharp, cutting voice sliced through the air. &#34;Hector, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned towards the voice. Leyla stood at the entrance, cheeks still flushed from her competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been buzzing with confidence, eager to find Hector and brag about her sure-win performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she&#39;d spotted him-shoulders hunched,speaking low to Eliana, eyes carrying a strange mix of flattery and... something else. Something like  admiration he didn&#39;t want to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla couldn&#39;t understand why he would start having a good impression about Eliana. Was he merely feeding her ego? The Clarke family was gullible enough to still believe Miguel&#39;s recovery was Eliana&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing nice to her for the sake of the family made sense. But why that flicker of reluctance? It was almost.as if Hector wanted Eliana, knew he couldn&#39;t have her,yet couldn&#39;t bring himself to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought clawed at Leyla&#39;s composure, making her chest tighten and her pulse spike. Before she could stop herself, she stomped toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hector looked up and saw her, his gaze slipped away,avoiding hers without even knowing why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, masking the sudden awkwardness. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I finished my painting,&#34; Leyla said, her tone light,her expression carefully smoothed over. She gave Jeffry a polite nod, pretending the storm in her chest didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once they weren&#39;t looking, she shot Eliana a glare -sharp and cutting-loaded with unspoken warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana blinked at her, puzzled. What was that about?  Did Leyla honestly think she was into Hector? The idea almost made her laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector wasn&#39;t her type-not even close. His presence alone irritated her, and the last thing she&#39;d ever do was play the &#34;other woman&#34;, especially for a man already tied to someone like Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust tightened in her chest. She turned to Jeffry.&#34;I&#39;ve got things to handle.I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could say a word, she turned on her heel and walked away, not looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s jaw ticked, his displeasure simnmering-not at Eliana, but at Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d planned to smooth things over and maybe talk Eliana into reconsidering helping Miguel&#39;s friend, but Leyla&#39;s sudden entrance had chased her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was cool when he turned to her. &#34;Why&#39;d you come out so quickly? I saw the others were still at it.Did you walk out of the competition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla straightened. &#34;No... I didn&#39;t.&#34; She softened her tone, trying to explain. &#34;An hour&#39;s plenty for me.I already finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Copying an image lodged in her mind was second nature to her-it didn&#39;t require much thinking. That was why she was always the first to wrap up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s expression eased a fraction. &#34;Alright then.We&#39;ll just wait for the results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The results would be posted within an hour after the competition ended. There was nothing to do now but wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s confidence returned in full force. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.This one&#39;s mine-no contest.&#34; Her certainty was enough to push Jeffry&#39;s irritation to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector,too, momentarily forgot his complex feelings for Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry drifted off to greet a few of the big shots present,leaving Hector and Leyla alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hungry?&#34; Hector asked. &#34;Want me to grab you something sweet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Leyla wasn&#39;t thinking about food. She was thinking about the look she&#39;d caught in his eyes earlier. That flicker of reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question burned in her throat until she couldn&#39;t hold it back. &#34;What exactly were you talking about with that bumpkin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s brows knit. His voice was quiet but firm. &#34;Don&#39;t call her that. She&#39;s talented.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s face went pale, eyes wide with disbelief.&#34;Hector... are you scolding me for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed to snap him back. He shook his head quickly. &#34;No. I&#39;m saying, if my dad hears you talk like that, he&#39;s going to be mad at you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;Okay,&#34; she murmured.But she wasn&#39;t letting it go. &#34;You still haven&#39;t answered me. What were you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector kept his tone even. &#34;Nothing much. My grandpa&#39;s friend needs her help with a health problem.My dad and I were trying to get her to assist him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s brows pulled together. &#34;Weren&#39;t you skeptical about her being the miracle healer? Why the sudden   &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s proved it,&#34; Hector cut in. &#34;My grandpa&#39;s health has gotten much better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit her likea slap. Heat flared under her skin, and her hands curled into fists so tight her nails bit into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp sting was the only thing keeping her anger in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not here. Not now.She would wait Once the results were announced and she claimed her victory, no one-not Jeffry, not Hector, or anyone else-would have any reason to look down on her again.</p>
