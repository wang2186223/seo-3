                <p>Draped in a soft blend of blue and pink, Leyla moved with the poise of someone who knew eyes would follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Hector laid eyes on it, he knew it was the very dress he&#39;d purchased for her the month before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, it had only existed in glossy magazine pages,out of stock everywhere, and had arrived while he was away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it on her now only confirmed his instincts-his choice had been flawless. The gown framed her figure even better than it had on the professional model.Her makeup, more polished than usual, gave her the delicate allure of a decadent dessert just waiting to be savored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s gentle elegance had always been the style Hector admired most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after a short separation, he felt the ache of missing her,though his mind insisted their relationship needed to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she drew nearer, a sudden tightness gripped his throat, making it hard to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the phone pressed to his ear, Jeffry continued, &#34;That Leyla is both foolish and petty-she&#39;s not worth your time. A man in your position can have anyone.Cut her loose, and the sooner the better.Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his father&#39;s words snapped Hector out of the daze Leyla had put him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he muttered vaguely before ending the call with some flimsy excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It never crossed Jeffry&#39;s mind that Leyla might be at the charity event-he assumed she had no standing to be there-so he didn&#39;t realize Hector had hung up just to give her his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hector...&#34; Leyla&#39;s voice trembled as she reached him,her eyes glistening before she could say more. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you so much...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened into silence as a tear slipped down her cheek, catching the light in a way that made it impossible to doubt her yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up among six Murray boys,each with their own personalities, had taught her exactly how to draw a man&#39;s heart closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days she had perfected this tearful look in front of her mirror, adjusting every flicker of her gaze until it felt natural. Now was the moment to put it to use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hector&#39;s eyes softened with worry and a flicker of regret, she knew her preparation had paid off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than rush into more words, she let her eyes linger on him, drinking in his presence as though she&#39;d been starved of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight chipped away at his resolve until it was gone completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance in a few steady steps,he paused briefly before taking her hand in a firm hold.&#34;Leyla,I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve been buried in work these past days and ended up neglecting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his grip eased something tight in her chest, and she allowed herself an inward sigh of relief.Hector still cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her free hand, she gave her thigh a discreet pinch, just enough to make her eyes sting with fresh tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she kept them from spilling,allowing them to glimmer at the edge as if her emotions were barely restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That almost-breaking expression twisted the guilt deeper into his chest. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I won&#39;t make you  wait again. No matter how busy I am, I&#39;ll find the time for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through those shimmering eyes, she appeared as though she longed for him but refused to hinder his important work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small shake of her head and replied,&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. If you&#39;re busy, go ahead. I&#39;ve been tied up with a few things myself, and I might not make it back for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words caught Hector&#39;s attention instantly.&#34;What&#39;s been keeping you so busy? I thought your company went under with the Murray Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, this matter has nothing to do with the company. It&#39;s something personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what personal matter would that be?&#34; Hector asked, unaware she had already taken the lead in steering the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Leyla had full control of the exchange.In an unhurried tone, she asked, &#34;Have you heard of Davin Gordon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the renowned oil painting master?&#34;Hector&#39;s surprise was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. That&#39;s the one.&#34; &#34;My father&#39;s art collection includes several of his works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin stretched across Leyla&#39;s face. &#34;He decided I would be his last student, and I&#39;ve been soaking up everything he teaches about painting. He actually suggested I enter the oil painting contest at today&#39;s exhibition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flickered in Hector&#39;s eyes. &#34;Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;d make up something like that? You know I never lie to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough for Hector. He trusted her word right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given where Leyla stood now, Davin&#39;s support made all the difference. Without him, she wouldn&#39;t have made it into the competition at all, much less stood a chance of qualifying. That realization sent a wave of hope through Hector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dad had never been fond of Leyla, blaming her for past slip-ups and thinking she&#39;d never amount to much. The moment his dad discovered that Leyla was now under Davin&#39;s wing, he&#39;d have to reconsider. The thought sparked Hector&#39;s enthusiasm as he leaned forward. &#34;So,what do you think-can you win this thing?&#34; Leyla nodded and replied, &#34;I won&#39;t pretend I&#39;m guaranteed first place, but I&#39;ve got a strong shot. Mr.Gordon told me about the others in the running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those competitors had talent, sure. None, however,could match Carl&#39;s abilities. And Leyla&#39;s knack for imitation was top-notch. If she could capture even eighty percent of what made Carl&#39;s piece special, the trophy would likely end up in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector could barely contain himself. &#34;That&#39;s perfect.Go get ready. I&#39;m making a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &#34;Why are you calling him? Well, he&#39;s always warned you not to get too close to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was another story. Listen, the moment you win today, he&#39;s going to change his tune and let you in. I&#39;m certain of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla paused for a moment, then straightened her shoulders with a sense of resolve. &#34;If that&#39;s how it is,I&#39;ll get ready now. Call him once I&#39;m set.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got it.&#34; Hoping to give Leyla an edge, Hector spoke to the staff and secured a quiet spot just for  her. Thanks to his efforts, Leyla remained tucked away,unaware when Carl showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hands in his pockets, Carl lost himself in the details of a painting called Corner of Broken Stones.On a ledge carved from ancient rock,a single bloom clung to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone looking could sense the flower&#39;s unstoppable energy right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is brilliant!&#34; Carl blurted out, his eyes drawn to the signature in gold at the bottom right. It was Riley&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition dawned on Carl at once. So that explained the power of the piece. Riley&#39;s style was plain, but his work always stuck in the mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most oil painting legends, as far as Carl was concerned,cared more about self-praise than true art. In his eyes,even his offhand sketches could rival their best efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley Wade stood apart as the only painter Carl truly respected. He could also make room in his heart for Davin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davin&#39;s paintings caught Carl&#39;s attention because hints of Riley&#39;s teaching always showed through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding out later that Davin had trained under Riley made everything fall into place for Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl! Over here!&#34; A cheerful voice echoed from behind,brightening the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl spun away from the painting, his face lighting up at the sight of Eliana. &#34;I&#39;ve been searching for you!Where did you disappear to?&#34;</p>
