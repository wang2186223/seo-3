                <p>A prickling sense of dread crawled up Jonny&#39;s neck as soon as the last word left his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he didn&#39;t dare turn around, he could feel it-the razor-sharp stare drilling into him from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct screamed that the glare came straight from Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit Jonny-Eliana wasn&#39;t just anyone; she carried Tristan&#39;s endorsement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubting her meant doubting Tristan himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic twisted in Jonny&#39;s gut, robbing him of his composure. No matter how worried he was about Davin,he couldn&#39;t forget the kind of power Tristan wielded. Nobody crossed Tristan lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke out along Jonny&#39;s hairline. While he struggled to come up with a way out, the doctor&#39;s voice cut through the tension, full of outrage. &#34;What nonsense are you spouting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had been on the verge of rebuking Jonny for his thoughtlessness, but the interruption gave him pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward, the doctor continued, &#34;Dr. Murray is extremely skilled. Dr. Hardy chose her for chief surgeon on his own-and for good reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the Gordons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Mercer Hardy&#39;s reputation as the best heart specialist at the hospital was what built the hospital&#39;s fame to begin with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration coloring his tone, the doctor didn&#39;t hold back. &#34;If you&#39;d seen Dr. Murray in that operating room,you&#39;d know exactly what she&#39;s capable of. Dr. Hardy himself now assists her-it&#39;s that simple. Without her intervention, the patient would have left us hours ago. Try to show some respect. Dr. Murray was trying hard to save your grandpa.&#34; Jonny&#39;s jaw hung slack, disbelief painted across his face. Words completely deserted him. Recognition of Eliana&#39;s real talent had never crossed his mind, let alone the idea that she&#39;d earned such swift respect from both Mercer Hardy and this outspoken doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impressing those two so quickly-especially when it meant riskig offense to the patient&#39;s family-said everything about her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awareness dawned in Jonny&#39;s eyes, the sting of embarrassment mixing with genuine guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This outcome was the last thing he&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping to smooth things over, Stan stepped in. &#34;Doctor, please accept our apologies. Jonny sometimes lets his nerves get the better of him, especially when family is involved. He meant no real offense.Please let Dr.Murray know that we see her as a savior. No matter how things turn out, our gratitude to her runs deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, derisive sound escaped the doctor, who dismissed the confrontation with a single glance before disappearing through the operating room doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every second counted inside as the surgical team fought desperately to keep Davin tethered to life. There was no space for petty arguments-only focus and skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras captured every movement and decision in that room. If tragedy struck, the record would show Eliana had done everything humanly possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the thick doors swung shut, sealing away hope and fear together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease rippled through the corridor. Stan and Leonie traded tense glances, each casting a silent rebuke at Jonny for his reckless behavior.How could he be so naive, wasting days with his canvases while forgetting the weight of a name like Tristan&#39;s? Anyone that man vouched for deserved respect, not doubt. But irritation aside, Jonny was still their own flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, Stan crossed over to Tristan, his words careful. &#34;Mr. Pearson, I apologize for my son&#39;s thoughtless remarks. He was acting out of worry, not disrespect. Please accept our regrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s expression didn&#39;t shift, his tone cool as glass. &#34;You should count yourselves fortunate that Davin was Eliana&#39;s protégé. In any other case, Jonny wouldn&#39;t have gotten a word in-let alone a second chance.&#34; Stan&#39;s jaw slackened with shock. Eliana? Was he referring to that young female doctor? Was she really the mentor behind his father&#39;s progress? The idea that someone could bridge the worlds of art and medicine with such mastery felt almost unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, realization finally dawned on Jonny. Tristan&#39;s words made it clear-if not for the bond between Eliana and Davin, she never would have agreed to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude should have been their first response, yet he&#39;d managed only rudeness and suspicion. Regret flickered across his face, his feelings tangled between shame and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory of the doctor&#39;s fierce loyalty to Eliana flashed through Tristan&#39;s mind. He pressed a palm to his forehead, unable to shake the sense that someone else always got to be the hero in Eliana&#39;s story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Rocco stepped in beside Tristan, lowering his voice. &#34;Mr. Pearson, there&#39;s something you need to know about Leyla...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll talk once Davin comes around,&#34; said Tristan, his faith in Eliana unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated from him-he had no doubt Davin would pull through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sidelines, Leyla watched Tristan&#39;s group for any sign of anger or blame. Their calmness gave her a sliver of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the ordeal would be over the moment Davin breathed his last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret crept in, sour and unexpected. Had she acted sooner and given Davin the medicine, the praise might have been hers instead of this awkward spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Leyla pushed those thoughts aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that mattered now was Eliana&#39;s suffering. If tragedy struck, Leyla was certain guilt would eat Eliana alive -and Leyla would savor every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leyla&#39;s mind spun back to old grudges. If Eliana hadn&#39;t shown up at the exhibition hall with Carl, none of this chaos would have happened. The Clarke family&#39;s approval would already be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room thickened with unease as the minutes crawled by, each tick of the clock building the tension higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The double doors swung open at last, and Eliana stepped out, Mercer and the rest of the surgical team trailing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the anxious crowd surged forward. Tristan stood, making his way to the front with urgent strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stan wastedno time, his concern spilling out. &#34;Dr. Murray, please-how&#39;s my father? Is he all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abrupt shift in the Gordon family&#39;s demeanor caught Eliana off guard. Their tone was suddenly respectful,even deferential-so different from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off her surprise, she answered steadily, &#34;The operation wasn&#39;t easy. There were moments we nearly lost him, but we managed to pull him through. Everything went as well as we could have hoped. Still, waking up will be Davin&#39;s own fight now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded Stan and Leonie&#39;s faces. They glanced at one another, then started to bow deeply in gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saved his life, Dr. Murray,&#34; Stan said, his voice thick with emotion. &#34;We owe you a debt that can never be repaid. If there&#39;s ever anything you need, we&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana gently stopped them, her hand raised. &#34;No need for such formality. Davin is my student. I simply did what any teacher should.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny hovered,caught between wanting to apologize and desperate to thank her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned away from him, addressing Stan once more, saying, &#34;I can&#39;t promise when he&#39;ll wake. He&#39;s in the ICU now-visitors aren&#39;t allowed inside yet, but you can see him through the observation window.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Murray, thank you-truly, thank you!&#34; Stan&#39;s relief was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small nod was Eliana&#39;s only response before she shifted her attention and strode straight toward Leyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that the operation had gone well, Leyla felt her confidence evaporate. Her legs nearly gave out beneath her. Instinct begged her to bolt, but pride anchored her in place as Eliana advanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning poise, Leyla asked, &#34;Did you want something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a swift, unexpected motion, Eliana seized Leyla&#39;s wrist and pulled up her sleeve, exposing bare skin for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing? Let go!&#34; Leyla exclaimed, yanking her hand, outrage in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Eliana leaned in, her voice low and pointed. &#34;Care to explain how you got this scratch on your wrist?&#34;</p>
