                <p>Hector couldn&#39;t deny his feelings for Leyla, and knowing she had acted with him in mind, he found it hard to be harsh with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, since his family was all angry with her now, he leaned in close to murmur, &#34;Go on home,&#34; before turning his back to rejoin them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing alone, Leyla refused to let the Murrays see even a flicker of defeat in her. Her chin lifted, her grievances swallowed, and she strode away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, it wasn&#39;t only her dignity that had been bruised-she was certain the Murray family had been equally shamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they had thrown an extravagant welcome-home banquet, complete with a towering champagne display, yet the turnout had been pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, she was convinced, the high society would be snickering at the Murrays behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of her wanted to linger by the entrance, clinging to the hope of running into Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Jordy&#39;s voice cut through her thoughts. &#34;Aren&#39;t you leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a sharp glare. &#34;Whether I go or stay is none of your business-you&#39;re just a servant. Know your place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face didn&#39;t so much as twitch as he responded, &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m just a servant. But you seem to have forgotten-you&#39;re no longer part of the Murray family. That gives me the right to show you the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; The word snapped from her lips, but the thought of creating more trouble for herself, especially with the Clarke family inside, kept her from saying more. She stalked off with a glare instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside the hall, Miguel made his way to Stella and Eliana, bowing low in gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella quickly reached out to steady him. &#34;Mr. Clarke, please, there&#39;s no need for such formality.&#34; Miguel shook his head. &#34;There is every need. Without your daughter,I&#39;d already be nothing more than ashes in an urn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made Tristan&#39;s gaze snap sharply toward Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition hit him instantly-she was Stella&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions that had clouded his mind-why she would risk her life storming into the Fist Guild gym for Sean,how she had known about his engagement to Miss Murray-were answered all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood now that her goal was for him to be the one to end their engagement on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the weight of Tristan&#39;s stare, Eliana shifted slightly, avoiding his eyes. &#34;Mr. Clarke, there&#39;s no need for such formality..,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella, oblivious to Eliana&#39;s unease, turned her attention to their guest. With visitors arriving, joy lit her expression. &#34;How are you feeling these days, Mr. Clarke?&#34; she asked warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m doing much better. Not long ago, I couldn&#39;t even manage daily tasks, but now I&#39;m attending a banquet,&#34;Miguel replied with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re honored you came in person. Please, have a seat,&#34; Stella said with genuine sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Miguel nodded and settled into a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning next to Tristan, Stella added, &#34;Mr. Pearson, please sit as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s nod came with a look toward Eliana-brief, pointed, and unreadable-before he moved past her to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two guests who had been on the verge of leaving quickly reconsidered. Seeing such influential figures seated at the table, they hurried to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing a table with such influential company sent a thrill through them, erasing any trace of earlier disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for word to spread-both the Clarke and Pearson families had shown up at the Murray banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within an hour, the once nearly empty banquet hall had swelled with people, many of whom hadn&#39;t even been invited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion reached the White family soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;The Clarke family? Weren&#39;t they always on bad terms with the Murray family? Why would they show up now-especially when the Murrays have fallen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zach&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Forget the Clarke family. The real question is-why is Tristan there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the point worth worrying over-how Tristan truly viewed the Murrays</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Qidence, his name alone carried enough weight to shift the balance in any circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung between them until Zach&#39;s eyes drifted toward Brenda, who sat quietly on the sofa. &#34;Brenda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head lifted in mild surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to take two gifts and pay the Murray family a visit,&#34; Zach said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenda&#39;s eyes went wide.&#34;Dad, have you lost it? I&#39;m about to get engaged to Cullen, and you want me walking into the Murrays&#39; place now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown, Zach said, &#34;This isn&#39;t about doing favors forthe Murray family. It&#39;s about Tristan. The Pearson Group&#39;s expansion this year is centered in Qidence, and we can&#39;t afford not to establish a link with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier in the year, Zach had spent months shuttling between Qidence and Eighvale, searching for a way into the Pearson family&#39;s circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one point, he had even put himself on the line, stepping in to help a woman against the Onyx Syndicate,hoping she would open the door to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that effort had gone nowhere-the woman still hadn&#39;t introduced them-and in the end, he&#39;d returned to Qidence empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, to his irritation, the Murrays-whom they had deliberately kept at arm&#39;s length-were already in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s orbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing Brenda with a steady look, he added, &#34;When you&#39;re there, make sure Tristan notices you.If you can&#39;t manage that, at least figure out exactly where he stands with the Murrays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenda let out a sharp laugh. &#34;So if Tristan&#39;s close to the Murray family, you expect me to what? Dump Cullen and run back to that cripple? Forget it! That&#39;s never happening. I couldn&#39;t stand Darnon even before-dense as a stone, that one. You shoved me into that relationship, and now that he&#39;s stuck in a wheelchair,I wouldn&#39;t go near him if my life depended on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zach&#39;s expression darkened instantly. &#34;Who said anything about you getting back with him? I&#39;m telling you to gather information and get Tristan to notice you. What nonsense are you spouting? And is that any way to speak to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her,head sharply, Brenda snapped,&#34;I&#39;m not going. If you want to play matchmaker, you do it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly what the Murray family thought of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into their banquet would be like stepping straight into a wall of mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenda wasn&#39;t the kind to swallow her pride, and she had no intenion of subjecting herself to that humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zach&#39;s voice dropped to a cold threat. &#34;Not going? Okay. From today on, you won&#39;t be leaving this house.Forget about your engagement banquet with Cullen too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, Cullen had never been his ideal choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason Zach had allowed the engagement was to prevent the Murray family from pushing Damon onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenda&#39;s eyes widened, disbelief written all over her face. &#34;You&#39;re threatening me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; Zach started to retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before tempers could flare any further, Addie stepped in, taking Zach by the arm. &#34;Honey, don&#39;t work yourself up. You know what the doctor said about your blood pressure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Brenda, Addie said firmly, &#34;Brenda, say sorry to your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Zach nor Brenda budged, both turning their heads away in silent defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought suddenly lit inAddie&#39;s mind, and she spoke again. &#34;Honey, maybe this isn&#39;t the right time for Brenda to show her face at the Murray family&#39;s banquet. Why don&#39;t we send Barry instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zach&#39;s brows pulled together. &#34;Barry? Why are you bringing him into this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in close,Addie murmured something in Zach&#39;s ear. Slowly, the tension in his face eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re thinking we set Barry up with that Murray daughter who just came back from the countryside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie said with a faint smile, &#34;That&#39;s exactly it. If the Murrays really are tight with the Pearsons, we can&#39;t keep avoiding them. But if Barry marries their daughter, the whole situation flips in our favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zach rubbed his chin, his voice losing some of its bite. &#34;What if she&#39;s not interested in him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barry&#39;s name had been dragged through the mud more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addie replied, &#34;She&#39;s just a girl from the countryside. She probably doesn&#39;t know better. And with the Murrays losing influence, Barry&#39;s still a solid prospect for her. When I spoke with her the other day, she struck me as the type who&#39;d jump at the chance to marry into money-naive and eager.&#34;</p>
