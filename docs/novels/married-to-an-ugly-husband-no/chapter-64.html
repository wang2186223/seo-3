                <p>A curious reporter asked, “Why did you suddenly buy so many cars? Moreover, they’re the same model.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian looked at Hailey tenderly and said with a smile, “To support my fiancée!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, someone with a keen eye noticed the ring on Hailey’s left ring finger and asked, “Oh, is that an engagement ring? Adrian, you really love Hailey!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, are you showing off your love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations! Congratulations to both of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The future Mrs. Harrington is so beautiful! Both of you are a match made in heaven!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, you’re really the envy of all women for having such a loving boyfriend!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the models wore a name tag, so in just a moment, Hailey’s name spread through the entire place. Members of the media also began posting about it on social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s smile grew wider and wider when she saw that the crowd around the Hummer had grown smaller and smaller. She pretended to casually glance at Natalie, but she could not hide the arrogance in her eyes at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian also looked at Natalie several times with a proud expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Natalie only found it amusing, thinking to herself, ‘Those two are really ridiculous. Do they really think I’ll be bothered by this?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was completely unaware that her beloved husband had plans of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, a commotion suddenly broke out near the entrance of the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several well-dressed individuals surrounded a man, surrounding him like the stars that surrounded the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was tall, taller than most of the men in the venue. He was extremely handsome, and his expression was aloof. His noble temperament was like that of a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge of the car exhibition personally accompanied the man, explaining diligently, “Sir, Scene B has thirty cars, among which…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is Oliver here?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Natalie could figure it out, Oliver stopped less than a meter away from her. She was sitting on the Hummer, but she was still not as tall as him. As such, she could only look up at him. Even with the distance between them, she could feel his overwhelming and domineering aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Oliver arrived, the entire place quieted down; only hushed voices could be heard, discussing the identity of the handsome man and why the person in charge of the car exhibition personally accompanied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge thought Oliver was interested in the Hummer, so he quickly said, “Sir, this Hummer is the best car in Scene B. It’s…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored the inquisitive gazes directed at him and strode forward, approaching Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie held her breath and stared at Oliver unblinkingly as he approached her. He was also looking at her, and his gaze was as profound as ever. She felt extremely nervous, wondering what he would say or do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver placed his hand on the hood; his slender fingers gently caressed the Hummer as he said, “This car is not bad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, you have a great eye!&#34; the person in charge said, filled with praise, &#34;This is the latest model...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver bypassed Natalie and circled the car, seemingly serious as he inspected the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew very well that Oliver did not care much about the Hummer. He already had so many cars at home. Moreover, his Maybach was much suited to his lifestyle and preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, the attention of the people at the venue had already shifted from Hailey’s Audi to Natalie’s Hummer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was still trying to figure out Oliver’s intention when she heard him say in a low voice, “I’ll take 31 of this car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the person in charge did not know who Oliver was; he only knew that Isaac respected Oliver. He stared at Oliver incredulously as he asked, “Sorry? Sir, you are sure you want 31 of this car?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must I repeat myself?” Oliver asked with a hint of impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, no! I’ll get someone to make the arrangements immediately!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge smiled so widely that his eyes almost could not be seen. With this order, his bonus this month would increase several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s actions stirred up a commotion immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, who was sitting on the hood of the car, could clearly see the media frenzy. Lights kept flashing as people took photos of her and the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Adrian’s purchase of 30 Audi coupes was really shocking, but it paled in comparison to Oliver. After all, 31 Hummers could buy almost 100 Audi coupes. This was a true display of wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Hailey and Adrian looked as though they had eaten flies, and they tacitly avoided looking at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Hailey, she was afraid that she could not feign love and admiration when she looked at Adrian, so she thought it was better to avoid the prideful man’s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Adrian, he was just too immersed in his frustration. After all, he had spent so much money but was still slapped in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He deliberately bought 31 cars!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian could not hide the anger in his eyes at all as he glared at Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Oliver completely ignored Adrian’s existence, not even sparing the latter a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, the person in charge asked, “Sir, would you like to see the other cars?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; Oliver replied curtly. His gaze lingered on Natalie for an extra second before he turned around and left the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one noticed anything strange, but Natalie could clearly see the intensity and darkness of Oliver’s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What did I do to anger him again? I don’t think I did anything wrong, right? I didn’t even say anything!‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the instant Oliver saw Natalie, he immediately regretted his decision to fly Arvin back to style Natalie. He could clearly see that everyone was staring at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>….</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The autumn car exhibition came to an end perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales today were extremely good, and the person in charge was naturally ecstatic. He invited the employees, including the models, to a dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What happened?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had left at this time, leaving only the employees and the models. As such, the person’s voice was extremely loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who had spoken pointed at the Hummer and asked, “H-How did the car end up like this?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look in unison and saw several deep scratches on the Hummer.</p>
