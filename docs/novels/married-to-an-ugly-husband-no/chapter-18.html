                <p>That was likely the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had always been a luminary, blessed with prodigious intellect and remarkable gifts. He skipped grades to middle school at the age of seven and was accepted by a world-famous university at ten. He had always been strikingly handsome. Hailey took immense pride in her status, boasting, &#34;I&#39;ll marry Oliver when I grow up. If you defy me, trust me, he&#39;ll destroy your family business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had changed since Oliver had an accident at the age of fifteen. Rumor had it that he had stayed in the premier ICU of Moalia for a month, enduring successive operations before finally clawing his way back from the brink. However, his well-being and appearance were grievously marred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, Hailey had ceased all mention of him, eager to sever ties with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could such a superficial, mercenary woman pique Oliver&#39;s interest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac promptly fished out his mobile and showed Oliver a photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was well aware that Isaac&#39;s regard for women was more casual than serious. He would only cast an appreciative glance if they were beautiful and toy with them at his leisure. Thus, Oliver nonchalantly eyed the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the first glimpse, his attention was abruptly seized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Captured within the frame was a woman poised on a runway. The vivid red fluffy skirt she wore was not notably remarkable, yet upon her, it seemed to radiate an instant air of refinement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady possessed exquisite features and stood impassively. She carried herself with an aura of detachment the night at the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, in this photo, she exuded nobility tempered with gentleness, reminiscent of a princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It mirrored the essence of the candid shots taken in the comfort of home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you recognize her?&#34; Isaac could tell from Oliver&#39;s expression that recognition had dawned, and unmistakable interest had sparked regarding this young lady!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Oliver wouldn&#39;t even spare a glance at a hot girl like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, brimming with enthusiasm, began an elaborate introduction about the woman who had captivated Oliver&#39;s attention. &#34;This lady&#39;s name is Natalie Watson. She&#39;s twenty, standing at 5 feet 9 inches. She&#39;s an ideal counterpart for you! Don&#39;t let her dainty frame deceive you. She boasts a C-cup! She truly embodies the epitome of proportion—ample bosom, slender waist, and long limbs. She&#39;s inherently destined for the modeling realm and harbors the potential to soar as an international supermodel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;She was previously under contract with Yancy Models, and her club appearance was likewise orchestrated by the agency. However, she severed ties with Yancy a few days ago. Eager to unearth the tale? She dug up some dirt on the agent and forced her to terminate her contract without any compensation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delving deeper, Isaac would uncover that Natalie was Oliver&#39;s wife, whom he had never met before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wanna be a matchmaker? I could lend a hand.&#34; Oliver regarded Isaac with a frigid stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm... Never mind.&#34; Isaac promptly clamped his mouth shut. His venture into matchmaking was solely confined to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the sake of Oliver&#39;s happiness and satisfaction, Isaac decided to orchestrate Natalie&#39;s transition to his own company, thereby providing Oliver with an opportunity to draw nearer to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m the paragon of a best friend! Where else would Oliver chance upon such a good friend?&#39; Isaac thought to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Oliver&#39;s phone vibrated. A new message had just arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Marjorie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Oliver, we have a family banquet the day after tomorrow. Why not bring your wife back?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marjorie was convalescing in Moalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver recollected the talk he had shared with Isaac. He had never expected Natalie to manage to terminate the contract without any penalty. Her strategic prowess remained unbeknownst to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she were to return to the Windsor&#39;s place unaccompanied?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Windsor family&#39;s banquet, Adrian, who stood as an in-law through marriage to the Windsor family, would also be present. Oliver was curious about what Natalie would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to the Windsor&#39;s place alone?&#34; Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in astonishment as she heard Oliver&#39;s suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frigid and scornful visages of the Windsor family members, etched in her memory from the wedding, flickered through her thoughts. A profound dread took root within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going?&#34; A sliver of hopefulness resonated in Natalie&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver cast a dispassionate look her way, drew deeply on his cigarette, and with an air of arrogance, expelled smoke rings into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m frail and susceptible to ailments, so it ill suits me to venture outdoors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Natalie sucked in a deep breath, stifling the words &#34;you shameless bastard&#34; that threatened to escape her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Windsor family of Paykston stood as the most eminent family in the nation, their prestige acknowledged across international boundaries, their clout and authority spanning the globe. Since the turn of the last century, they had upheld a highly esteemed familial legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their estate was an imposing blend of different architectural styles, its multi-tiered buildings exuding an aura of timeworn grandeur upon approach. Moreover, it emanated a formidable, overwhelming presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam, we&#39;ve arrived,&#34; Charles reminded Natalie to get out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tall and solemn mansion&#39;s double doors were wide open, with guards and servants standing outside. Friendly conversations and laughter wafted through the open doors, creating a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, welcome.&#34; A servant gestured for Natalie to enter. His soft words attracted everyone&#39;s attention. All guests in the main hall turned to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were about ten people inside, all dressed in designer clothing, exuding an air of nobility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they glanced at the entrance and confirmed that Mrs. Natalie Windsor had arrived, they started unabashedly scrutinizing her, their gazes filled with disdain and contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just like at the wedding all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie dragged her feet as she shockingly stared at two people not far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why...would Adrian and Hailey be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, this is Sir Windsor, Mr. Oliver&#39;s father. This is Ms. Victoria, Mr. Oliver&#39;s elder sister. This is Mr. Edwin, Mr. Oliver&#39;s elder brother. This is Mr. Adrian, Ms. Victoria&#39;s son. And this is Mr. Adrian&#39;s girlfriend, Ms. Hailey,&#34; Charles introduced them one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Windsor family&#39;s relationships were complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was Henry&#39;s legitimate son, born to his legal wife while Edwin was Henry&#39;s illegitimate son. His mother only married Henry shortly before her death. The eldest child, Victoria was Henry&#39;s favorite as her mother was Henry&#39;s first love. Instead of marrying up, she married into the Harrington family and gave birth to Adrian. And it didn&#39;t undermine her power in the Windsor family. As a result, Adrian also held a high position within the Windsor family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry had another son, Arthur Windsor. Arthur was the youngest and shared the same mother with Oliver, but he wasn&#39;t at home today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly collected herself, pretending not to recognize Adrian and Hailey. She politely greeted the Windsors one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Oliver?&#34; Henry asked with a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Henry, Oliver is unwell and couldn&#39;t make it.&#34; Natalie had thought of an excuse before coming over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s your husband. You can&#39;t convince him to accompany you for our first meeting? Does he even like you a bit?&#34; Henry didn&#39;t hide his disdain towards Natalie as he expected her to soften Oliver up with her good look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he&#39;s sick. Maybe he doesn&#39;t wanna come. Who knows.&#34; Victoria elegantly smoothed a strand of hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in her early forties. Due to the magic of skincare, she only looked like someone in her thirties, with hardly any signs of aging. She had a beautiful face that bore a striking resemblance to her son, Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, it&#39;s not news that Oliver doesn&#39;t like the Windsor family and us. Look, this is a family gathering. He doesn&#39;t bother to come and only sent his wife.&#34; Edwin resembled Henry a lot and looked polished in a pair of rimless glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry&#39;s scowl deepened. Words from Oliver&#39;s siblings made him more convinced that Oliver was intentionally disrespecting him. He looked at Natalie in a more disdainful manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, forget him. Let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a few minutes, Natalie had known that Oliver was an outcast in his family.</p>

                <p>&#34;Natalie, why not talk to me?&#34; Hailey walked towards her, holding her hands, and said in grief. &#34;Are you still mad at me?&#34;</p>
