                <p>Half of Natalie&#39;s beautiful face was stained with blood, and she looked like a character in a slasher movie that made everyone wet their pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop looking at yourself if you&#39;re afraid. How stupid are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver turned the tap on and splashed water at the mirror, distorting the reflection in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie returned to her senses, but she was still scared. When she looked down and saw the sticky slime from the snake on her legs, she felt nauseous immediately and started shivering uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Oliver watched a shell-shocked Natalie, an indescribable feeling swelled up in his heart. He did not think that her current appearance was terrifying at all. Instead, he thought that she looked pitiful with her eyes swollen from crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver contemplated for a moment before walking over and grabbing Natalie&#39;s wrist. He led her to the sink and ordered, &#34;Bent over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Natalie obediently did as she was told. She avoided looking at the mirror and bent down, her gaze fixing at the tiles on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard the sound of running water. A warm hand scrubbed the stain on her face away with warm water. She stiffened for a moment and started squirming when she realized that Oliver was washing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his bad temper, Oliver chided her and continued to scrape the snake&#39;s blood off her face with one hand. At the same time, he muttered in self-mockery, &#34;In my 25 years of life, this is my first time washing someone else&#39;s face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned and winced due to Oliver&#39;s rusty and rude movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her cry sounded sweet and charming to Oliver, filling him with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Damn it!&#39; Oliver cursed inwardly and spoke harshly to Natalie, &#34;Bear with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My face hurts...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep complaining, I&#39;ll have my way with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blushed so hard that even her ears were red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow and thought, &#39;When she argued with Adrian in the garden, she was bold and fierce. Why is she suddenly so shy? Which side of her is real?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Natalie&#39;s face was clear of snake blood, revealing a beautiful and enchanting face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Clean yourself up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Natalie lowered her head and began to undress, only caring about getting out of the blood-stained clothes as soon as possible. She was in the midst of unbuttoning her blouse when she suddenly realized that she wasn&#39;t alone. Her head snapped up and she met eyes with Oliver, who was leaning against the wall with one hand in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, she quickly clenched her blouse, facing her back to Oliver. At the same time, she stammered, &#34;Oliver, you... Would you please leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tapped his fingers against the wall. His dark eyes glinted as he said, &#34;Hey, you&#39;re the one who tries to seduce me once you are sane&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What a narcissist! Why does he always think I want to seduce him? It&#39;s not like I intentionally undressed in front of him,&#39; Natalie thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he had just helped her to wash her face. Moreover, it was her fault for undressing before he left, though she didn&#39;t mean it. For these reasons, she reminded herself to be polite toward Oliver. &#34;Mr. Oliver, I&#39;m going to shower now. Would you please leave the bathroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was amused and thought, &#39;One moment ago, she was acting like a cat whose tail got stepped on. Now, she&#39;s pretending to be a harmless little rabbit. What an interesting pet...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie closed the bathroom door behind Oliver. Then, she quickly removed her clothes and threw them aside. She turned the shower on and let the warm water pour down on her.</p>
