                <p>Hailey had noticed the man next to Isaac earlier. His appearance was outstanding, and his aura was noble and domineering. It was as though he did not care about anyone or anything. Moreover, since he was with Isaac, she knew he must have an extraordinary background as well. Such a man was a fatal temptation to women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is my good friend. His surname is Windsor,” Isaac said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Isn’t Isaac afraid of exposing Oliver’s identity by introducing him like this?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, after thinking about it for a moment, it was rather unlikely for anyone to associate the handsome man in front of them with the ‘hideous’ Oliver Windsor even if they had the same surname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Hailey extended her hand and said with a gentle smile, “Mr. Windsor. Nice to meet you. I’m Hailey.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at Hailey with a hint of disgust before he crooked his finger at Natalie, gesturing for Natalie, who was standing nearby, to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie walked over reluctantly. She did not want to get involved, but Oliver clearly did not give her a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver wrapped his arm around Natalie’s waist, leading her away as he said, “Let&#39;s go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Not only does Natalie know Isaac, but she knows this Mr. Windsor as well?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey felt extremely unwilling. A strong sense of unfairness surged in Hailey&#39;s heart as she looked at Natalie’s waist. Then, she called out, “Natalie! You’re so… intimate with Mr. Windsor. Aren’t you worried about upsetting your husband? Have you forgotten that you’re already married?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey deliberately emphasized Natalie’s marriage status. It seemed as though she was reminding Natalie, but her real goal was to tell Oliver that Natalie was a married woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was really curious. She wondered if Hailey would feel foolish if Hailey knew that the man next to her was Oliver. In the end, she only said, “If you have so much free time, you should focus on Adrian instead.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey turned around and said shamelessly, “Mr. Windsor, my sister is Oliver Windsor’s wife. Please let go of her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s arm remained wrapped around Natalie’s waist as he said, “If you can’t bear the thought of her being with a man more handsome than Adrian, you should find one yourself.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found that his former fiancée, Hailey, was becoming more and more of a nuisance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie could no longer hold back her laughter and burst out laughing. She did not expect Oliver to hit the nail on the head. Moreover, he even praised his own good looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey clenched her hands. Her eyes turned red as she suppressed her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Noah stood up for Hailey, saying, “Mr. Windsor, Hailey is just kindly reminding you not to be deceived by this scheming woman. Don&#39;t be ungrateful!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah thought that Hailey was angry because Hailey was unfairly unaccused, but only Hailey knew that she was angry at being exposed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hailey, Noah!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian, who did not see the two women in the parking lot, came over at this time, breaking the stalemate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Adrian!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey shifted her gaze from Oliver to Adrian immediately and smiled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Brother!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah seemed to have found a supporter at this moment. She glared at Natalie arrogantly before she ran to Adrian’s side. Then, she pointed at Natalie and said, “Brother, look at who’s here!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of joy flashed in Adrian’s eyes, but his smile disappeared when he saw the hand around Natalie’s waist. He narrowed his eyes as he looked at Oliver. He questioned angrily, “Natalie, who is he?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah quickly replied, “Brother, he’s Natalie’s lover!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at Oliver. Based on his icy expression, it was clear he had no intention of speaking. She really did not know what to say so she only remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Adrian&#39;s eyes, Natalie’s behavior was a sign of acquiescence to Noah’s words. He was inexplicably annoyed by this. He strode over and grabbed her hands and said indignantly, “Natalie, how shameless can you be?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before Adrian’s hand could even touch Natalie, Oliver blocked him before twisting his wrist and pushing him back. He stepped in front of Natalie, shielding her as he said with an icy gaze, “You don’t deserve to touch my woman.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey felt her heart skip a beat. She found that Oliver had a nice voice, and most importantly, she felt that it was very familiar. Unfortunately, she could not remember when she had heard it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Adrian had felt annoyed as soon as he saw Oliver. After all, Oliver’s appearance was so outstanding that even he was shocked. The animosity he felt was only normal since someone of the same gender was much superior compared to him. Moreover, Oliver was hugging Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, come here,” Adrian said. It was as though he was still her boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Natalie coldly, waiting to see what she would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie moved closer to Oliver before she said, “Adrian, you should call me ‘Aunt’. Have you forgotten your uncle’s reminder?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver noticed Natalie’s subtle movements, and he could not help but smile slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, stop using Oliver to suppress me! You used to be my girlfriend!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You said it yourself, I used to be your girlfriend,” Natalie said. Then, she turned to Hailey before she continued, “Hailey, please control your boyfriend.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s face had turned pale long ago. Since Adrian saw Natalie, he did not spare a glance at her even once. He was too busy arguing with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mr. Windsor, let’s go,” Natalie said as she gently tugged at his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Adrian contemptuously before he tightened his grip on Natalie possessively and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you fickle woman!” Adrian shouted angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced up at Oliver, and she saw his lips moving slightly as he glanced at Adrian, mouthing the word ‘imbecile’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not until Natalie completely disappeared from sight that Adrian remembered Hailey and Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a hint of resentment flashed in Hailey’s eyes. However, she quickly covered it. Up and said with tears in her eyes, looking gentle and pitiful, “Adrian, it seems like you still care about Natalie. If you still like her, we can…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah quickly interjected to ease the tension. “Hailey, don’t overthink it. My brother was just a little angry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Noah turned to Adrian and said, “Brother, Natalie is a terrible person. You saw it too. She even mocked Hailey when you weren’t around earlier. You should comfort Hailey.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hailey, I no longer have any feelings for Natalie,” Adrian said, hugging Hailey, “The person I love is you, okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Aw, now the lovebirds are showing off in front of me!” Noah said playfully, rubbing her arms as though she had goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To appease Hailey, Adrian took her to the jewelry store owned by the Watson Group and bought her a whole set of the latest limited-edition jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, Hailey finally stopped sulking and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That’s right. Natalie is already married. How can Adrian still have feelings for her?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Isaac, who had been watching the show, finally could not hold back his laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, “Oliver, I used to feel unjust for you when I heard those rumors. However, it was really entertaining when I watched those idiots earlier!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was already used to this. He turned to Natalie and said, “Sister-in-law, I didn’t expect you to have such a strong combat power!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, no, you’re overpraising me,” Natalie said. At the same time, she blushed when Isaac addressed her as ‘Sister-in-law’.</p>
