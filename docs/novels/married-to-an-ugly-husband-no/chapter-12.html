                <p>As soon as Natalie showed up, the entire venue fell silent for a second. When she turned around, revealing her fair back, cheers and whistles erupted from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the hungry gazes of those men on the first floor, Oliver&#39;s eyes turn cold instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could his wife participate in such a show?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie! What are you wearing? Where&#39;s the outfit I gave you?&#34; As soon as Natalie stepped off the stage, Sienna grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna&#39;s grip was so strong that Natalie felt hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I switched my dress with someone else,&#34; Natalie said casually while discreetly touching the hidden recorder in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she got the evidence tonight, she could terminate her contract with them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll deal with you later!&#34; Sienna dragged Natalie toward the private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen up! You&#39;ll take good care of Mr. Evans. You heard me?&#34; Sienna said. &#34;He&#39;s satisfied with your performance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered Room V204, Sienna pushed Natalie toward Brian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Natalie knew she would do that and protected herself in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans, this is Natalie. How do you think?&#34; Sienna asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good! Sweetheart, drink with me!&#34; Brian gazed at Natalie, eager to have this beauty beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie forced a stiff smile and reluctantly took the drink, knowing that there was something off about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she raised the glass to her lips, Natalie abruptly pulled it away and said, &#34;Mr. Evans, I can drink this, but before I do, I have a question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead and ask,&#34; Brian replied, waiting for her to drink the concoction that would turn a virtuous woman into a harlot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much did you offer Sienna to hand me over to you?&#34; Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a smart girl!&#34; Brian said, enthralled by desire. &#34;One million, I&#39;d say! Honestly, you&#39;re not the first woman Sienna sent me. But you are the most beautiful one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pressed the recorder in her ear and smiled, surprised at how easily she got him to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly stood up and headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t leave this private room, she would end up on Brian&#39;s bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, where are you going?&#34; Sienna noticed Natalie&#39;s attempt to escape. She told the guards, &#34;Follow her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a few strides, Natalie found herself intercepted by the sturdy bodyguards. Panicking, she darted into room SV208.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the room was dim, hosting a collection of alluring hostesses dressed hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blended in, picked up a bottle of champagne, and walked toward a corner where a person was leaning against a sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced down at her kneeling by his feet, her black dress gracefully contouring her body and revealing an enticing expanse of her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his angle, he could see her cleavage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to do anything; merely kneeling silently on the ground made her the most enticing presence in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a group of men broke the door and barged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing? Do you know who&#39;s in this room?&#34; the person in charge of room SV208 shouted angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re looking for someone!&#34; the leader of the bodyguards replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie paused as she was pouring a glass of wine. And she lowered her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver gazed at her without a hint of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throw them out,&#34; Isaac ordered, annoyed by these guys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the bodyguards could react, three men in suits showed up, blocking their path. The three men had stoic expressions and huge muscles, completely overpowering the bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, this seems to be an SV suite.&#34; one of the smaller bodyguards whispered to his leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s face instantly turned pale. SV suites were the most exclusive ones, and they couldn&#39;t afford to offend people in these rooms. &#34;S-sorry! Sorry to interrupt! We&#39;ll leave now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was on the verge of breathing a sigh of relief when the man beside her unexpectedly spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you looking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice sounded like the finest cello, and Natalie found it familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie cautiously turned her head. The man took a drag from his cigarette. Smoke rings wafted from his seductive lips, dispersing to reveal a handsome yet merciless face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hazel eyes were devoid of any emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver Windsor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing here? Did he see her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, you see, there&#39;s a woman who stole our boss&#39; diamond. We saw her running into your private room, and we were trying to catch her,&#34; the bodyguard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, they&#39;re lying!&#34; Natalie grasped Oliver&#39;s trousers, quietly pleading, &#34;I didn&#39;t steal anything, they were trying to force me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he didn&#39;t harbor any affection for her, she was still his wife. He couldn&#39;t simply allow other men to lay their hands on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver took a drag of his cigarette and continued to look at her indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman at his feet tilted her head up, looking fragile. Her eyes reddened with desperation, yet she dared not make any other movements, putting all her hopes in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver suddenly wondered what she would do if he didn&#39;t help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in shock. Oliver was so ruthless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women around let out cries of surprise as the bodyguards began scrutinizing each woman&#39;s face. Natalie grew anxious, her palms sweaty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver!&#34; she called his name, infuriated, but her voice was so low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this is your job?&#34; Oliver&#39;s words were audible only to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; she hesitated, unsure of what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smoked quietly, the smoke blurring his cold expression. He no longer paid attention to Natalie, as if he didn&#39;t care if she would be caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards were about to approach them when Natalie decided to take a bold move. Without hesitating, she sat on Oliver&#39;s lap, her hands wrapping around his neck as she pressed her face close to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! What the hell am I looking at?!&#34; Isaac had his jaw dropped.</p>
