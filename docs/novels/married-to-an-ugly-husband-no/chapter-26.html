                <p>&#34;Natalie, why didn&#39;t you say so when the snake wrapped around you? Why say it now?&#34; Oliver&#39;s face darkened. Not recovering from her fear, she was so weak that he could barely feel her punches. Oliver was surprised that she thought she could walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was not convinced. &#34;I don&#39;t want you to hold me! You set me up and then came to my rescue. I won&#39;t be fooled. You jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop yelling, or I&#39;ll throw you back to the snake.&#34; Oliver halted and threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Natalie reflexively held onto Oliver&#39;s broad shoulders. She probably would have psychological trauma towards snakes for the rest of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smiled faintly as Natalie finally calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just accuse me of setting you up?&#34; Oliver brought the dubious content in Natalie&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You asked Hailey to tell me that you wanted to see me. I was here because of your order. But when I called you for help, you never picked up.&#34; Natalie grew more and more aggrieved as she spoke. &#34;You tricked me. What a jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was mad, but he chuckled, &#34;Natalie, are you a fool? Hailey is Adrian&#39;s girlfriend. Why would I ask her to give you a message? When you called me later, I couldn&#39;t answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I can&#39;t stand the sight of Hailey.&#39; Oliver frowned at the thought of Hailey. There was no way that he would ask her to do things for him. What were the servants for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pouted and thought, &#39;But Hailey is also your former fiancée. Who knows what you&#39;re thinking?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t believe me?&#34; Oliver lowered his gaze, staring at Natalie, who was curling up in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she answered no inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nata... What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a woman&#39;s scream was heard in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey saw Oliver&#39;s tall and upright figure first. Then she noticed that he was holding a woman in his arms, presumably Natalie. Wanting to get Oliver&#39;s attention, Hailey was about to greet them. She opened her mouth and saw the maid behind Oliver pick up something with a flashlight in her other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the light, Hailey saw the thing the maid was holding. It was a bloody dead snake with its head shot off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified, Hailey felt her legs buckle. She looked around for Adrian, wanting to seek comfort from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hailey could turn around, Adrian brushed past her and ran towards Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice filled with joy, he exclaimed, &#34;Natalie! Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Hailey&#39;s panicked expression, Natalie subconsciously looked behind her and screamed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so scared that she burrowed her head against Oliver&#39;s chest, trembling all over as she finally realized what that warm liquid that splashed on her was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the snake&#39;s blood!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even dare to look at herself. She was certain that she was covered in disgusting snake blood from head to toe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, are you a fool?&#34; Oliver couldn&#39;t help but scold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had covered her eyes earlier to spare her the trauma. But she had foolishly craned her neck to look behind them. Only a fool would do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian finally reached them and was shocked by the intimate scene of the couple. He cared about Natalie so much and wanted to ask her about her well-being. All the words turned into a lump in his throat, making him feel hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move,&#34; Oliver coldly said to Adrian. &#34;Be mindful of how you address her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of Adrian&#39;s mouth twitched. He found the situation was so unfair. Why did he have to call Natalie...Aunt Natalie?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She belonged with him, not Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian stepped aside, and Oliver carried Natalie towards the main building, casting a dark look at Hailey, who was still in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, I&#39;m so scared. The snake... It&#39;s...&#34; Hailey shivered and ran to Adrian, her arms wrapping around his waist. She deliberately pressed her soft bosom against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of her effort, Adrian&#39;s gaze followed Natalie. Hailey cursed inwardly, &#39;It&#39;s all that bitch&#39;s fault.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, I&#39;m so scared. Kiss me, please.&#34; Before Adrian could react, Hailey pressed her lips against his, taking back Adrian&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nighttime had a way of stirring up feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian quickly lost in Hailey&#39;s passionate kiss. A fire started in his abdomen, and he had an urge to pin her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, I love you. Do you love me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Adrian was clouded by desire and did not even know what he was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the long and passionate kiss finally came to an end, Hailey seized the opportunity and sighed with feigned concern. &#34;It has been just half a month. And Natalie has become Oliver&#39;s woman. However, I&#39;m glad that they get along so well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian thought, &#39;Get along so well?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were like rubbing salt into his wound. Oliver was arrogant and never showed care toward others. Adrian was shocked when Oliver suddenly ran out in the middle of the night to look for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, Adrian had been mad at Hailey as Natalie said that Hailey forced her to marry Oliver. However, after thinking about it, he felt that Hailey only did what she did because Hailey loved him too much and did not want to marry Oliver. In comparison, Natalie was immature and couldn&#39;t stay faithful to him. Adrian decided that she was simply not worthy of his affection!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My goodness! What happened?!&#34; a servant cried in shock when she saw a bloody Natalie being carried into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored everyone and made his way upstairs, making orders without pausing. &#34;Prepare a change of clothes for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously, by her, he meant Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Oliver disappeared up the stairs, the few servants exchanged looks and started whispering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver is a neat freak. However, he actually carried Natalie all the way back. Did you see how dirty she was? She wasn&#39;t even wearing shoes. It&#39;s disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. How unexpected. It seems like Natalie knows a thing or two about seducing men. She managed to capture Oliver&#39;s heart in just a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian happened to walk in and overheard the servants talking about how affectionate Natalie and Oliver were. Unsurprisingly, anger rose in his heart. He asked harshly, &#34;What are you gossiping about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants quickly apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Adrian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey glanced at the servants and smirked. She didn&#39;t plan this, but the servants had subconsciously helped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian stormed back to his room, and Hailey hurriedly followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the duo left, the servants could not help but start gossiping about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that Natalie used to be Adrian&#39;s ex-girlfriend. Looks like Adrian still has feelings for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s hard to move on sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although Hailey is more esteemed than Natalie, Natalie is much more beautiful and elegant. Moreover, I heard that Natalie is also much more talented.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie is Adrian&#39;s ex-girlfriend, but she&#39;s now Adrian&#39;s aunt-in-law as she&#39;s married Oliver. Hailey is her sister and Adrian&#39;s current girlfriend. Once Hailey marries Adrian, she would have to call Natalie &#39;Aunt Natalie&#39;, right? Talk about a complicated family tree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, stop talking. If we&#39;re caught gossiping about the employers, we&#39;ll be fired!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver put Natalie down and pointed at the bathroom. &#34;Go clean up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s head was in a muddle. So, she obediently followed Oliver&#39;s orders, still wary of being sent back to that horrible forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, her scream rang from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver rushed over and saw Natalie stare at her reflection in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wore a white chiffon blouse and a pair of light khaki wide-leg pants. However, her blouse and pants were in tatters after the trip. Her white blouse was stained almost completely red by the snake&#39;s blood.</p>
