                <p>Jane took over and pocketed five balls while Natalie pocketed three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver in disappointment and said with a sigh, “It’s over. We’re going to lose.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression was very dark at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining few balls were not hard to hit, and Jane felt confident about their victory, so she chatted casually with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did you invest in the autumn car show this year?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, why?” Isaac asked as he hit a ball into a pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you think of Natalie?” Jane asked meaningfully, “She was chosen to go for an interview for the show. Do you think she’ll be chosen in the end?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was surprised, causing him to miss the shot. After all, he had been thinking about how to contact Natalie so he could create opportunities for Oliver. Unexpectedly, the opportunity came to him so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Isaac missed the shot, Natalie laughed. “Thanks for going easy on me, Isaac!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane frowned. “What’s wrong with you, Isaac?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Wyatt looked at Isaac disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That was an accident… I was distracted…” Isaac said sheepishly, feeling guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was in good form this time. During her turn, she effortlessly made the last two shots. Finally, she had her chance to shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver and Miss Watson won,” Wyatt said as he looked at Isaac sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isaac, roll up your sleeves!” Jane said with a threatening smile as she raised her hand and prepared to hit Isaac’s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What a useless teammate! How could we have lost?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sighed and accepted his fate to be punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just to clarify, it’s fair that I punish you once. You can’t sabotage Natalie’s chances during the interview,” Jane said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not!” Isaac said. In fact, he actually wanted to sign Natalie. He knew she had the potential to be a supermodel. She would definitely be a fashion icon in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud smack rang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ouch!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac inhaled sharply as red welts appeared immediately on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Jane raised her arm in front of Isaac. He looked at her delicate and soft arm before he said, “Forget it. As a man, I can’t bring myself to hit you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane raised an eyebrow before she lowered her arm and said, “Well, it’s only right that I don’t have to be punished. After all, you’re the reason we lost.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac felt another blow on his heart. “Miss Jane, your words are really ruthless.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane only smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We only spoke about punishing the losers, but we haven’t decided on what the winners have to do,” Wyatt said. He glanced at Oliver and saw that the latter had no intention of objecting to his words.“</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What? The winners also have to do something? Why are we being punished when we won?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt like Wyatt was toying with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone next to Wyatt said, “You don’t know the rules. It must be your first time here. It’s not a punishment; it’s a reward!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver, who was leaning against the table indifferently. In the end, she asked, “So what do the winners have to do?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt looked at the expressionless Oliver before he said, “You have to kiss Oliver’s neck.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie exclaimed, “What?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, everyone cheered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is good! Your suggestion is really good!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Will it just end with a kiss on the neck? Who knows if it’ll develop something more?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on, come on! Let’s get started.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s ears turned red when she felt everyone’s gaze on her, and she looked at Jane for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane shrugged, indicating there was nothing she could do. She thought to herself mischievously, ‘Darling, since you agreed to kiss if you lose earlier, what’s a kiss on the neck?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Jane always felt that Natalie could do better. She did not have a good impression of Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver...” Natalie called out tentatively. She looked at him, hoping he would refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hmm?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her; his gaze as cold as ever. He did not refuse. Instead, he was waiting for her to make a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip and looked at his neck. His Adam’s apple was quite distinct, and when it moved, it looked incredibly sexy. She moved to stand in front of him, only reaching his shoulders. She did not dare to look at him at all, and she could hear her heart pounding in her chest. After a moment, she took a deep breath and mustered up her courage before she looked up, tiptoed, and kissed his neck nervously; exerting a little too much while she was at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, Natalie hastily stepped back with crimson cheeks. Perhaps due to her haste, she lost balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver quickly reached out and held her waist. Then, he said in a low voice that only the two of them could hear, “Why are you so embarrassed when you’re kissing your own man?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked and embarrassed, Natalie hurriedly moved back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling sorry, Jane quickly wrapped her arm around Natalie’s shoulders, slightly blocking Natalie behind her. Then, she said, bidding farewell to everyone, “Everyone, Natalie and I still have something to do, so we’ll take our leave first. If there’s a chance, let’s meet again!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac raised his hand and said, “Alright, take care!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a few steps before she turned back to look at Oliver. He stood in the dim light, and she could not see his face and could only see his tall figure; but for some reason, she had a feeling that he was looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac walked over and asked with a nosy expression, “What are you thinking about, Oliver?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not respond and left using the VIP exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, a woman saw this and tried to catch up, hoping to get Oliver’s number. However, before she could get close, two men, dressed in black suits, seemingly appeared out of thin air and blocked her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Miss, you can’t enter.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What? Why? I’m also a VIP member.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Because my boss can easily revoke your membership.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“…”</p>
