                <p>Roger’s smile remained on his face as he watched her leave, thinking that she had said she was faithful to her marriage, not her husband or love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Natalie did not marry Oliver out of love. She had a chance to ask Roger to take her away from Oliver, but she did not seize it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is this woman the one whom my little brother loved? Alas, she’s now someone else’s wife…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His meeting with Natalie at the hospital was a coincidence. When he saw her face, he had found her vaguely familiar but did not think much of it. After all, he had only seen her once when Roger Wild died. He had seen her on the cliff, refusing to believe that Roger Wild had fallen. It was only when she mentioned his brother’s name that he recalled who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his brother’s death, he had taken on his brother’s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger shrugged, thinking to himself, ‘If she doesn’t want my help, then so be it. I’ll just make sure to refuse any mission related to her in the organization…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, he felt there was no longer any need to follow Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Roger was about to leave the supermarket, Natalie happened to be standing in line to pay for her groceries. At this time, she pushed her long hair to the back, revealing two distinct and unique moles below her ear, which were red and brown respectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger froze immediately. His eyes were fixed on the two vertical moles below her ear. His eyes, which had been devoid of emotions for years, surged with tumultuous waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie sensed Roger’s piercing gaze, she looked at him in confusion. However, seeing that he did not say anything, she quickly paid for her things and left. However, she had just walked out of the supermarket when her wrist was grabbed from behind. With this sudden movement, the medium-sized shopping bag in her hand hit her leg twice, causing her to gasp in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger took the shopping bag from her and said, “Let me carry it for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wild, what exactly do you want from me?&#34; Natalie asked indignantly. She usually had a good temper, but she could not help but feel angry at the man who resembled Roger Wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you used to live in Tycoon City?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Roger, surprised by the myriad of emotions fleeting across his face. There was nervousness, anticipation, eagerness, and gratitude. After all, he had always seemed emotionless. After a moment, she replied, “Yes. How did you know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Lucas had lived with their mother in Tycoon City before living with the Watsons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger suppressed the excitement in his heart, unused to so many emotional fluctuations, and asked, “Do you remember the person you met outside of Starry Grid Elementary School when you were a child?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not say that the person was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him strangely and said, “I don’t remember much of that time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? Think again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head and said, “I really don’t know. I had a high fever when I was nine, and I don’t remember anything before that. I don’t think I know the person you’re looking for. Moreover, Starry Grid Elementary School was a top school in Tycoon City. My mother couldn’t even afford to meet our basic needs, let alone send us to school.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger could not believe that he had identified the wrong person. After all, there were many people with red and brown moles below their ears. However, there were very few people with a red and brown mole stacked vertically behind their ears. Moreover, there was a small mark on her brown mole, looking exactly like the mark he had left when he accidentally poked it with a pencil when he was a child. With this, he was certain that he was not mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wild, I still have something else to do. Goodbye,&#34; Natalie said, glancing at the time. If she returned any later, who knew when Oliver would be able to eat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nat...&#34; Roger called out, using her past nickname, but Natalie did not react at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does she really not remember anything? Even if she doesn’t remember, why would she say that she was poor?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger thought that Natalie had changed a lot compared to when she was a child. She had become even more beautiful, gentle, and resilient than he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of the little girl wearing a princess dress with big eyes, shining and looking like a doll, kept appearing in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To hide from enemies, Roger was sent by his father to live with an ordinary family in Tycoon City as a child. The father of that family was violent and often physically abused him and the mother after drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would always remember the first time he met her. At that time, he was practicing martial arts in a corner of the old house. A little girl with two braids stood next to the flower bush not far away and asked, “What are you doing? Your arm is bleeding! Aren’t you in pain? Wait, there’s a cut on your mouth as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl was clearly scared, but she still walked toward him with eyes shining like the stars</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always been a gloomy child with no patience to deal with such delicate creatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl pouted in dissatisfaction. &#34; Why did you scold me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss! Why are you here? You&#39;re still young. Don’t simply talk to strangers!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two men in black suits caught up at this time and stood in front of the little girl, looking at him disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl looked at the bodyguards and said, “Can you buy some medicine for him? Oh, get him something to eat as well!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she turned to him and said, “My name is Nat. What’s your name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to the present, Roger took a cigarette out and lit it. Until now, he still could not figure out why she would bring him medicine and food almost every day even though she was clearly afraid. There was a time when he almost fainted from a fever, and she was the first one to notice it. He was reminded of their encounter at the hospital; she was clearly terrified at that time, but she still saved him. It seemed like regardless of her fear, she was the type to save someone in need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After last night&#39;s incident, Roger had also guessed Oliver’s hidden identity and investigated Natalie’s background. He was puzzled. How did his Nat become a daughter of the Watson family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to Roger’s presence, Natalie did not have time to buy some of the ingredients she needed, so she could only make do with what she had already bought.</p>
