                <p>‘Uh…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac suddenly felt like he could not breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No wonder. I always felt that there was something wrong with Oliver since we entered the room and saw the women in bikinis… I thought he was just unhappy because he had a reaction. As it turns out… Oh, no! I made his wife parade around in a bikini in front of others… This is simply suicidal! Is there time for me to change the models’ attire?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alas, it was too late now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hailey and Noah smoothly took their positions at the front and at the left of the car, the two models confidently took the positions at the back and the right side of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, everyone’s gaze fell on Natalie who stood alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s skin seemed to shine under the spotlight. Her waist was slender, and her legs were long. Even a hint of abdominal lines could be seen on her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in all, it was a figure that would make it hard for men to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s eyes suddenly narrowed, and his fingers that were tapping the wooden armrest suddenly froze. He really wanted to wrap her tempting figure up with a blanket at this moment. After all, his belongings should not be displayed for others to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, should I stop the audition?” Isaac asked, gulping. He finally realized how foolish his previous actions were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Heavens, what kind of trouble did I get myself into?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac could speak again, a loud bang suddenly rang from the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ah!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, my goodness!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two buckets that were placed on the side suddenly exploded, splashing the models standing near the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey, in particular, bore the brunt of it and was drenched from head to toe, looking very disheveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a step back in fright. If it were not for the four people blocking her, she would have been soaked as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah’s legs were wet. She said with a disgusted expression, “Is the water clean? This is so gross!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What&#39;s happening?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s going on backstage?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges were also bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s wet hair was plastered on her face. The corners of her lips twitched as she suppressed her temper before she looked at the head judge sitting in the center and asked, “We’re in such a state now… How are we going to continue the audition like this?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory Clayton, the head judge, frowned. He was about to ask the people backstage about this unexpected incident when he suddenly received a message from Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Change their audition attire immediately!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory did not understand the reason behind Isaac’s message, but he quickly ordered, “Have them change into new clothes for the audition!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver silently put away his silenced gun with a blank expression on his face. He was the one who had caused the two buckets to explode with a single shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac felt the low pressure around him, he did not dare to speak. Instead, he questioned Wyatt angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Why the hell didn’t you tell me sooner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: I just found out yesterday. I was too busy and forgot to tell you about it. Is it my fault that you’re too impulsive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Damn it! This guy is too unreliable!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An employee led Natalie and the other four women to the changing rooms. This time, they were given a black dress each that showcased their figures without being revealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing this, one of the models muttered under her breath, “Why do we have to wear this? It’s unfair. We’re obviously at a disadvantage compared to the others.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee said, “Miss, this is an order from our superior. If you’re unhappy, you’re free to leave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The model pouted and quickly fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After changing her clothes, Natalie sighed in relief. She did not expect to benefit from this misfortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hailey blew her hair dry with a gloomy expression on her face. She did not have time to dry her completely and was forced to tie it up hastily. Not only that, but she did not even have a chance to fix her makeup before she had to rush back on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other four people naturally returned to their positions, once again leaving Natalie out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why don’t I go and help Sister-in-law?” Isaac suggested tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shut up,” Oliver said icily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“As you wish!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac made a gesture of zipping his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s gaze was locked on Natalie. Although the dress was ordinary and simple, it seemed to have a different and enticing charm when Natalie wore it. He looked at her curiously, wondering how she was going to resolve this awkward situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, there was a simple solution to this five-person predicament, and yet, no one had thought of it. Previously, the other models fought so fiercely for the four positions, and none of them found that the best spot was still vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other four women in the group stared at Natalie intently. Noah, in particular, looked at her triumphantly and provocatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Natalie only smiled and opened the car door. Under the four women’s dumbfounded gaze, she stood on the seat of the convertible. She rested her hand on top of the windshield as she placed her legs in a position that revealed the curves of her long legs perfectly. She raised her chin slightly as her long hair fell over her shoulders. Her expression was cold, making her look like a brave and graceful warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other women posed in a sexy manner while Hailey posed in an elegant and refined manner, reflecting her noble persona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s coolness and arrogance stood out, immediately attracting the attention of the judges. Next to her, the other four women seemed like mere background decorations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory Clayton stood up excitedly. He clapped his hands as he exclaimed, “Excellent! After seeing so many people, I finally found someone who satisfied me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other four judges nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, an unknown emotion flashed in Oliver’s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘As expected, she seems like a completely different person once she’s on stage. She shines so brightly…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What&#39;s your name?” Cory asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie,” Natalie replied confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie? Your name sounds familiar…” Cory said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, the female judge next to Cory said, “Cory, wasn’t there a university student named Natalie among the models in the spring fashion show you directed last year? She became rather popular at that time. I think it’s her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory Clayton was famous in the fashion industry and had directed a lot of shows. He had acted as a judge this time to scout for new talents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re right! I remember now!” Cory exclaimed after realization dawned on him. Then, he said, “Young lady, I had high hopes for you before. What happened? Why did you disappear from the industry for a year?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There were some issues with the company,” Natalie explained vaguely before she said, “However, I’m back now, and I’ll work hard!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Very good, very good. Young lady, I have high expectations for you!” Cory said, praising Natalie again. Then, he suddenly remembered something and asked his peers, “Oh, I heard there’s a promising rookie in this group as well, right?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge next to him said, “It’s the one front. Her name is Hailey.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory took a look at Hailey before he shook his head and said in disappointment, “You secured a good position, but your performance is average. Hailey, right? Your posture is a bit stiff. Also, your shoulders are a little broad. It would give you an advantage when wearing coats. However, this gig requires you to wear outfits that reveal our shoulders…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie was praised and she was criticized, Hailey felt as though she had just been slapped in the face. However, she still smiled stiffly and thanked Cory. “T… Thank you for your advice, Mr. Clayton…”</p>
