                <p>&#34;Natalie, as long as you listen obediently, I won&#39;t let anyone bully you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sleeping for the night, the injuries on Natalie&#39;s face had indeed improved significantly. Following the &#34;maid&#39;s&#34; instructions, she applied some medicine, and the cool and soothing ointment relieved the remaining fiery pain on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie went downstairs and was amazed to see the foyer filled with stand-alone clothing racks, which showcased a variety of styles and designs, all women&#39;s clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat on his own single sofa, allowing Mr. Liam to direct the maids on how to arrange them. People from the clothing store outside were constantly bringing in more stand-alone clothing racks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady, good morning!&#34; Mr. Liam spotted Natalie standing on the second floor and said, &#34;The young master has prepared these clothes for you. Are you still interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bought them for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>’So many?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>’Is he planning on opening a women&#39;s clothing store?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned and quickened her pace downstairs, struggling to find the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master, these...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not like them?&#34; Oliver raised his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like that, there are just too many, and why... why did you suddenly buy me clothes? I have clothes,&#34; Natalie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie brought some clothing from the Watson family, it was enough for her, even though it wasn&#39;t much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just those clothes of yours?&#34; Oliver didn&#39;t hide his disdain. &#34;Throw them away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with her clothes? There were plenty of students at school wearing affordable brands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>’Do you have to buy clothes like these just to show off that you have money?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a model, Natalie naturally knew the value of the women&#39;s clothing Oliver bought, with the worst ones costing thousands or even tens of thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, I&#39;m still a student. It&#39;s not good to dress so ostentatiously.&#34; Natalie tried to reason with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t refuse these clothes because she was being picky, nor because she didn&#39;t wear designer brands. But she wasn&#39;t the one spending the money, and she and Oliver didn&#39;t have a partnership of equals between husband and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.&#34; Oliver stood up, not wanting to waste time discussing this with her. He told the servant, &#34;Put the clothes in the wardrobe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes. ’Fine, send them to your wardrobe, I won&#39;t wear them!‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unexpectedly, as if knowing her thoughts, Oliver said to her, &#34;In the future, wear something different every day, no repeats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Natalie really wanted to curse!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant organized the clothes, shoes, handbags, and accessories, categorizing them and filling two wardrobes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie first selected some slightly cheaper clothes and removed the tags after trying them on one by one. She kept the tags safe for later accounting, intending to pay Oliver back in the future. The jewelry and handbags remained untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when Oliver saw Natalie in the clothes he bought, he approved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This feeling of raising a pet was getting better and better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With school about to start, Natalie planned to find time to talk to Oliver about this matter formally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was majoring in modeling at Sense International University, and after the semester began, she not only had to attend classes but also participate in school activities and have the opportunity to walk the runway. It would be inconvenient to stay at the Rosewood Estate every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Natalie hadn&#39;t seen Oliver for several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Liam, is Mr. Windsor coming back tonight?&#34; Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know whether the young master is coming back or not,&#34; Mr. Liam shook his head without any hesitation, but he knew in his heart that the young master had gone to Europe for work inspection.</p>
