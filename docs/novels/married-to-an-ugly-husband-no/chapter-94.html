                <p>Unfortunately, Oliver’s condition did not allow him to engage in more intimate acts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie leaned against the edge of the bed, gasping for breath. When she turned to the back, she was horrified to discover that the curtains were not drawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the window, Rosy was watching with a gleeful expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the two women’s eyes met, Rosy even smiled at Natalie meaningfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No! How am I going to face her after this?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time to sleep, Natalie told Oliver she was leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Oliver called out from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’m going to sleep,” Natalie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep here,&#34; Oliver said as he gestured to the spot next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital bed for VIPs was very wide. It could easily accommodate two people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Natalie was stunned. Then, she quickly shook her head and said, “There’s an empty room next door.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come over,&#34; Oliver said again, not wasting any words. He did not care if there was an empty room or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled for a while before she walked over reluctantly and said, “You’re still recovering. It’s not good for me to sleep next to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He treats me like a pillow anyway. A patient like him doesn’t need a human pillow…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver said seriously, “We’re not doing anything on the bed. There’s no harm in sharing a bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This person is really…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes later, Natalie gave in and resigned herself to sharing a bed with Oliver. She lifted the corner of the blanket carefully, trying to get into bed, when Oliver suddenly reached out to pull her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out for your injury!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was shocked. She did not dare to struggle, worried she would aggravate his injury, so she could only stay still in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, don’t be stubborn,” Natalie said patiently, trying to reason with him, “Can you please listen to me and take it easy until your injuries heal?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was the silence and the night, her voice sounded even melodious to Oliver’s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tucked a strand of hair behind her ears as he said playfully, “No.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he suddenly thought of something and frowned before he asked, “Does the smell of medicine on me put you off?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’m just afraid of aggravating your injuries,” Natalie said, sighing inwardly. She did not expect that Oliver could be so clingy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t care,” Oliver said. He covered her with the blanket and closed his eyes before he ordered, “Sleep.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Oliver did not feel much. However, at this moment when Natalie’s soft body was nestled in his arms, he felt a sense of fatigue washing over him. He was still recovering from his injuries, but he had been working the entire day, after all. It was only natural that he felt exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at the ceiling, wide awake. Oliver’s arm was wrapped tightly around her waist while his body was pressed up against hers. She could feel the strength beneath his warm skin. For some reason, she felt an inexplicable and unfamiliar sense of belonging in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not know when she fell asleep. When she opened her eyes, it was already morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden sunlight streamlined into the room, creating a peaceful atmosphere that momentarily made one forget that one was in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie moved and heard a hiss behind her. Only then did she remember that she had slept while Oliver held her. She turned around stiffly, meeting a pair of deep and proud eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t move around,” Oliver said in a hoarse voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was puzzled. After a moment, realization dawned on her, and she quickly retreated in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Y-you, you… How can you be like this early in the morning?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were under the blanket, so Natalie could not see anything. However, she could clearly feel him earlier.</p>
