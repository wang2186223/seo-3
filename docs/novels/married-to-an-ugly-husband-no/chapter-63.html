                <p>Arvin was being honest. He would not have any thoughts about the woman in front of him even if she was beautiful. After all, he was very young and did not have a death wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blushed immediately. She thought of Oliver, her husband and also the only man she had ever kissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Arvin was done, he could not help but exclaim, “You’re truly beautiful!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, many of the models and beauty stylists turned to have a look. All of them looked amazed when they saw Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked ethereal in a white dress. Her long hair was loosely curled, adorned with white baby’s breath. In contrast, her makeup was a little stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin was very skilled in creating refreshing looks by using contrasting styles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If the dress isn’t so conservative, you’ll look even more stunning,” Jane said. With her background in fashion photography, she naturally had a good eye for these things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin pouted and nodded in agreement inwardly. After all, he knew that Natalie’s original outfit was a sexy leather outfit. Alas, the evil and domineering boss changed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Vivian was also done with Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey wore a sapphire off-the-shoulder dress. Her hair was tied up high, and her makeup was exquisite. If it were not for Natalie serving as a comparison, she would have definitely been the most eye-catching one today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘It’s only because she has Arvin!’ Hailey thought to herself as she glared at Vivian, blaming Vivian’s lack of skills and fake reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was a rising star in the industry, only recently rising to the top in the country. It was only natural that she could not compare to Arvin. She was not bothered by Hailey’s attitude. After all, she had dealt with many women like Hailey after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, in Vivian’s opinion, it did not make much of a difference who styled Natalie. Due to Natalie’s natural beauty, the results would still be the same. While she was working on Hailey earlier, she had been comparing Hailey to Natalie. She had to admit that Hailey was inferior to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Hailey wrapped her arms around Adrian’s waist and asked, “Adrian, do you think Natalie is more beautiful than me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian had to forcefully shift his gaze away from the dazzling Natalie before he replied, “Of course not, Hailey. In my heart, you’re the most beautiful.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey placed one hand on Adrian’s chest and said nervously, “However, Natalie will definitely steal all the limelight today. After all, she’s the main model, and her makeup and hair are done so beautifully…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian had a lot of experience with women, after all. As such, he quickly understood Hailey’s meaning. He said reassuringly, “Don’t worry. As my girlfriend, you naturally deserve all the limelight. So what if she’s the main model? As long as the car you model with has the most sales, the limelight will naturally fall on you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Hailey had achieved her goal, she happily kissed Adrian on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, Adrian! I love you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, after leaving the dressing room for Scene B, Isaac turned a corner and entered the adjacent VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac casually sat on the couch and said, “Oliver, I’ve already done my part. However, I really don’t understand. You specially flew Arvin back from France for your wife, but why are you hiding it for her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not think that Oliver was one to do thankless jobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Oliver was watching the live footage from the surveillance cameras in Scene B’s dressing room. He looked up at Isaac and only said, “Don’t ask too many questions.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That woman is ungrateful anyway. What’s the point of telling her? It’s not like she’ll thank me.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Fine, fine,” Isaac said. However, he was still very curious about what Oliver was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘At this rate, it’ll be difficult for you to chase your wife!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane did not leave. She claimed she was going to ‘settle accounts’ with Natalie for hiding things from her, but she naturally had no intention of doing such a thing. She only came to support Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car exhibition was about to start, the models went to their assigned areas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was assigned a powerful and fierce Hummer. Her ethereal dress contrasted greatly with the Hummer. It would have been more fitting if she had worn the black leather outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey smiled contemptuously as she looked at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Let’s see how she’s going to steal the show this time!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other models of Scene B were also looking at Natalie, hoping to watch her performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie walked around the Hummer with large and imposing tires. She leaned on the hood that only reached her waist, crossing her legs underneath her white dress. With one hand placed on the hood, she tilted her body slightly. She looked like an elf sitting on the military green Hummer. The discordance between the Hummer and her style was surprisingly refreshing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wow, I didn’t expect her outfit to go so well with the car in the end!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree. In the end, I think her looks suit the car. Initially, I thought it’d be over for her!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks really good! This is the first time I’d seen such a style paired with a Hummer!”S</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scene B’s models were mostly second or third-tier models. At the very least, they had to be in the third tier. As such, most of them were also quite experienced. They had been to several car exhibitions, but this was their first time seeing a model taking the ethereal and gentle route instead of the usual sexy route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hailey bit her lip and remained silent. She glanced at the car she was assigned: a red Audi coupe. She could not think of new and creative ways to pose, so she could only use conventional poses. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When guests and members of the media finally arrived, almost everyone’s attention was drawn to Natalie. Some of them were looking at the car, but most of them were looking at Natalie. Quite a few of them even brought their phones out and took pictures of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The members of the media also spent a long time in front of Natalie, taking photos from various angles. It was hard to tell if they were taking photos of the car or her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car assigned to Hailey was not particularly outstanding, and its pre-event publicity was also average. Only a few people stopped to look, and there was only one media outlet, which was sent by G Entertainment, taking photos of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s expression was very stiff at this moment, and she found it very difficult to smile as she thought it herself, ‘Natalie and the others must be secretly laughing at me!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Hailey finally found the person she had been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want thirty of this car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian’s voice was not low when he spoke to the employee next to him. The volume of his voice and his unusual order of thirty cars immediately attracted the attention of the people near him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Harrington family, it was nothing to buy thirty Audi coupes. Moreover, they could be used as company cars. This meant that Adrian could claim the expenses from the company later on. He had already thought it through before this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a reporter recognized Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Adrian, right? It’s nice to meet you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many people came to greet Adrian, and it did not take long before a small crowd formed in front of the Audi coupe.</p>
