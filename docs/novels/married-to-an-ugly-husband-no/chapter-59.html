                <p>Natalie stood there for over an hour, letting out a deep sigh, and finally walked in, hoping to fall asleep before Oliver returned, or at least pretend to be asleep, to avoid the awkwardness of facing him. The only consolation was that this oversized bed would allow her to stay as far away from Oliver as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like at the old mansion, Natalie slept on the edge of the bed, covering herself with a blanket she brought from the guest room. However, the sheets and pillows carried Oliver&#39;s scent, making her body tense with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although they had slept together on the same bed at the old mansion, that was under special circumstances. Now... it was completely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Click.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was startled and fell off the bed with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver turned on the light and saw a fluffy head poking out from under the blanket. With damp, big eyes blinking at him, the person sat on the ground, resembling an innocent and tender little kitten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie noticed a dim coldness and a hint of disdain in his gaze. She felt the disdain for herself for falling off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor...&#34; she awkwardly got up, still holding her blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lie on the bed, I&#39;m going to take a shower,&#34; Oliver said as he walked towards the bathroom, loosening his tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, you said you wouldn&#39;t force me!&#34; Natalie was startled by his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver paused, then turned to meet her vigilant eyes and posture, and that inexplicable annoyance surged within him once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, if I wanted you, I wouldn&#39;t need to consider time or place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she didn&#39;t sleep on his bed, he could still do as he pleased, whenever he wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt insulted, a slight burning shame on her cheeks. &#34;Then why did you ask me to...to sleep with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To warm the bed!&#34; Oliver naturally wouldn&#39;t admit that having her by his side that night at the old mansion unexpectedly brought him a sense of peace and comfort, more so than ever before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of running water came from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her lips, unable to escape or hide, only able to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have shared a bed with Oliver a long time ago. She didn&#39;t have the right to choose or resist. Earlier, when she could sleep alone, it was merely a stroke of kindness from fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver emerged from the bathroom, his short hair damp and dripping, bathrobe loosely worn to reveal his sturdy and strong chest muscles. His belt was undone, as if wearing the robe properly would somehow be a burden on his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman lay on the edge of the large bed, facing away from the center, just like she did at the old mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slept obediently, rarely shifting her position throughout the night. Unless deliberately done so, she could sleep in that one square foot all night long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move to the middle,&#34; Oliver said while drying his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie remained still, only her eyelashes trembling. &#34;I&#39;m already asleep and can&#39;t hear anything, don&#39;t know anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little did she know that when the man paused while drying his hair, a fleeting spark of playfulness flashed in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking she had escaped; Natalie didn&#39;t feel any danger even when the man got onto the bed. It wasn&#39;t until his hands clasped her waist, his strong arms pulling her around, that she spun and collided with a solid and broad chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...&#34; Natalie exclaimed, and as she lifted her gaze, she met Oliver&#39;s deep and light brown eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light, whether it was her imagination or not, she saw a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, what are you doing!&#34; Natalie&#39;s hand pressed against his chest, trying to push herself out of his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you asleep?&#34; Oliver lowered his eyes and questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... You woke me up,&#34; Natalie decisively shifted the blame, lowering her head and meeting the smooth, well-defined chest muscles of the man, which exuded a powerful presence. &#34;Mr. Windsor, please let go of me, I want to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just sleep like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words even finished, Oliver had already closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s body nestled in his arms, soft and delicate, more comfortable than any pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How am I supposed to sleep like this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt the urge to roar, resisting and struggling, attempting to annoy him enough to let go of her and let her &#34;misbehave&#34; by sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to seduce me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the man exerted force with his arm, and Natalie leaned in, feeling the burning heat emanating from his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s voice was already deep and coldly pleasant, but at this moment it had a slight huskiness that could make any voice enthusiast scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not!&#34; Natalie blushed but dared not move anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, please let go of me, okay? I&#39;m used to sleeping alone. I won&#39;t be able to sleep like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of you? Then what&#39;s the point of warming the bed?&#34; Oliver&#39;s face darkened slightly as he suppressed his body&#39;s impulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, it&#39;s not even autumn yet. Why would you need to warm the bed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This person is simply being unreasonable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver picked up the remote control from the bedside table, pressed it a few times, and immediately the cooling system of the air conditioner began to blow out a lot of cold air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a short while, Natalie felt the chill in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep!&#34; Oliver stared expressionlessly at the face that said &#34;I&#39;ll annoy you to death if you disturb my sleep&#34; and closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned by his mischievous action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is this person insane?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has he lost his mind?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the night at the old mansion, Oliver woke up the next day only to realize that he was holding Natalie. He had slight germaphobia and disliked physical contact, but the feeling of having the warmth and softness in his arms made his body only nostalgic without any rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breath between them carried the fragrant scent of a woman, with a hint of a sweet milky fragrance. It was the fastest Oliver had ever felt drowsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking her eyes, she didn&#39;t dare to move at all, let alone sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver&#39;s breathing became even and gentle, Natalie tried to pry his hand open and roll herself away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why was this man&#39;s hand still holding onto her even when he was asleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms are still so powerful!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t move at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s sleep is light, and he can sense when Natalie starts moving. He didn&#39;t want to say anything, but couldn&#39;t help himself and placed her restless little hand on his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but scold, &#34;Stop moving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or I will fuck you up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck me up? Is he going to have sex with me or kill me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man soon fell back asleep as if the actions and words from before were all a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling under her palm was tight muscles and a scorching heat, as if it could burn her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After enduring until dawn, Natalie gradually became sleepy, especially with the air conditioning set too low. The end of summer&#39;s air conditioning wasn&#39;t thick, but the man was like a furnace, able to drive away the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quality of sleep that night was surprisingly good, and Oliver woke up earlier than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he even opened his eyes, he felt something nuzzling and rubbing against his chest.</p>
