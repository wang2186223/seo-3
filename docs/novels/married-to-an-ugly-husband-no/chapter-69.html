                <p>While the celebration dinner for the employees of the autumn car exhibition was going on, Isaac, the extravagant wealthy offspring, along with other young elites, were having a gathering in the VIP room in the hotel as well. Needless to say, he had invited Oliver along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not expect to receive a call from Natalie in the midst of the gathering. She heard him calling Isaac’s name, and he could hear the abnormal tension in her voice. In that instant, he knew that she was in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oli… Mr. Windsor…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a sigh of relief. She felt as though all her strength had been drained from her body at this moment. She could not stand on her own for a few seconds and even had to lean on Oliver for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he touch you?&#34; Oliver asked in a frighteningly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“N-no…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not know if he meant literally or what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did he touch you?&#34; Oliver asked, clearly refusing to believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s nothing really…” Natalie said hesitantly, feeling ashamed. She did not dare to meet his eyes as she said, “He… just touched my face…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered. “I’ve barely even touched your face yet…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned by his reaction. He was clearly very upset at this moment. She tried to get out of his arms, but he held her even tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which hand did he touch you with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone like Mr. Brown, a disgusting scumbag, deserved to be taught a lesson. It was not hard to imagine that he must have harassed many women before. However, Natalie never expected that Oliver’s way of teaching someone a lesson would be brutal, even if it was not as brutal as severing someone’s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver released Natalie, strode over to Mr. Brown, and effortlessly pulled the latter up with one hand. Then, he dragged the latter toward a table before he pressed the letter’s hand into a freshly served steaming bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cry of pain, like pigs being slaughtered, rang in the room immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown struggled in agony, unable to move as Oliver kicked his knee. He fell to his knees with his hand still in the big bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A timid woman cried out in fear before she quickly covered her mouth with her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, spare me! Spare me!&#34; Mr. Brown yelled, &#34;Isaac! Isaac, please save me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shrugged. &#34;I can&#39;t save you when my good friend wants to teach you a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He must have a death wish for propositioning Natalie…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, please spare me! Please spare me! I won’t dare to be so presumptuous anymore!” Mr. Brown pleaded. Then, he turned to glare at Natalie fiercely before he continued to say, “It was her! She didn’t say that she was your woman, so I behaved in that manner! I didn’t mean any harm! Mr. Windsor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She didn’t say that she was my woman?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at Natalie before he turned his gaze back to Mr. Brown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip, shivering slightly. Based on his look earlier, it was clear that he was upset with her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about five minutes, Oliver finally let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown quickly pulled his hand away. His hands, which were fat, looked even more like pig’s trotters at this moment, swollen and greasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was silent, so Mr. Brown’s cries of pain were particularly loud. He did not dare to get angry at Oliver and could only continue to plead for mercy on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at his hand that touched Mr. Brown in disgust before he called out to Natalie, “Come here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at his raised hand and guessed his meaning. &#34;Should I fetch a towel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small sterilizer in the room filled with hot sterilized towels. Natalie quickly took one and carefully wiped Oliver’s hand. His hand was much bigger than her delicate hands. She held his hand with her left and used her right hand to gently wipe it. Her movements were so gentle that it felt like she was teasing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Oliver took the towel away from her before he held the back of her head with his left hand and wiped her face with his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt as though he was wiping her face with the force one would use to mop the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment before he continued to wipe her face thoroughly, wanting to clean the place that the pig’s trotter touched. Only he was allowed to touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It hurts. Be gentler…” Natalie said in a voice that seemed to soften Oliver’s heart. Because her eyes were closed, she did not see his eyes darken when she said these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come with me. Keep up,” Oliver said expressionlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly collected her bag on the chair and hurried after Oliver. As she walked, people automatically moved out of the way for her, avoiding her like she was the plague. No one dared to get close to her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie caught up to him, she said, “Oliver, thank you for helping me earlier.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she added, “Thank you for everything today.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did he just help, but he also helped her earlier during the car exhibition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was trying to suppress the surging heat in his body and was not in the mood to talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, are we going home?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he was ignoring her, Natalie had no choice but to obediently follow him.</p>
