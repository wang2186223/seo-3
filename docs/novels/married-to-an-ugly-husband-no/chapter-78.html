                <p>Oliver&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Do I like her? No. I only see her as an amusing pet…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the expression on Oliver’s face, Lucas said mockingly, “Don’t bother to deny it. The moment you walked into the room, your eyes never left my sister. When I mentioned Adrian, you’re expression turned cold. You were clearly jealous.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was surprised. The teenager was rather observant, nearly on par with his younger self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas continued to say, “If you really think you don’t like my sister, then you’re emotionally clueless. You don’t look that young. Have you never been in love before? Tsk, how annoying.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver clenched his hands, causing his veins to bulge, trying to hold back his urge to punch the annoying brat in front of him. However, Lucas’ words kept echoing in his mind, and he was shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Have I really fallen for her?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Natalie had caught Oliver’s attention the moment he had laid his eyes on her. He started treating her differently when she cooked him something that reminded him of the food that got him through the toughest time in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Forget it. My sister won’t like someone like you,” Lucas said as he crossed his arms, unaware of the thoughts that were racing through Oliver’s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh? What kind of person does she like then?” Oliver asked as he looked at his disapproving brother-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Someone who spoils her, cherishes her, and will remain loyal to her in body and soul. He must be devoted to her and also capable of protecting her. He also has to be talented,” Lucas replied, setting the minimum standards for his brother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered inwardly. ‘Too bad. In this lifetime, your sister can only be with me!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas looked at Oliver disdainfully and said, “Although you look outstanding, your temperament is too cold. Only my sister has the patience to tolerate you. Alas, you’re not worthy to be her boyfriend!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s her boyfriend, not yours. What right do you have to dictate who’s worthy of her or not?” Oliver said as he rose to his feet, exuding a powerful and oppressive aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Oliver’s imposing aura, Lucas lay on the bed with a smile on his face, looking completely unaffected as he said, “Mister, as a dying patient of leukemia, I don’t fear many things in life. I’m only advising you because you’re better-looking than my sister’s previous suitors. What’s the point of getting angry? Oh, it must be because you’ve yet to win my sister’s heart.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas had hit the nail on the head. After all, it was clear that Natalie had no thoughts about him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver narrowed his eyes as he thought to himself, ‘Why must she have such a detestable creature as her younger brother?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After confirming that Lucas’ condition was stable, Natalie’s face lit up with a smile, and she relaxed. After expressing her gratitude to the doctor, she left the doctor’s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she turned a corner, she felt a cold and hard object pressing against the back of her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t move!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stiffened immediately. She felt a powerful arm circling her from behind before pulling her into a stairwell. They were on the 18th floor, so she knew that it was unlikely that there would be people using the stairs here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was pinned against the cold wall, and she could smell an unfamiliar scent and the smell of rust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move, don&#39;t make a sound, and I won&#39;t hurt you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man’s voice was deep, and it carried an oppressive aura, but it sounded just slightly out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man continued to hold the pointed weapon at her waist while he reached up and forced her to look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie raised her head, she saw an extremely handsome man. His eyebrows were well-defined, and his eyes were captivating. His facial features were distinct. Although his lips were pale now, it did not diminish his beauty at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had seen many handsome men. Moreover, her own brother, Lucas, was also very handsome. She could not help but gasp inwardly when she saw this bewitching man even if she had already seen such a captivatingly handsome person like Oliver. One could only imagine how good-looking he was, considering that she had these thoughts while he was pointing a weapon at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Search for him! He&#39;s injured and can&#39;t run far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaotic footsteps and another man’s voice rang from above, fast approaching the floor they were on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man quickly tightened his hold on Natalie as he carefully listened to the urgent footsteps coming from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, when the man pulled Natalie into the emergency stairwell, she had accidentally touched his waist. However, it was only at this moment that she realized her hand was damp. She lowered her head and discovered her hand was covered in blood. The smell of rust she had smelled earlier was the smell of blood! With this, realization finally dawned on her; the injured man those people were looking for was in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was pale, and his breathing was weak. It was clear that he was severely injured and was just putting up a strong front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps drew closer and closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked up at the man who was just inches away from her. His appearance seemed to overlap with someone in her memories. In the next moment, she made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disregarding the danger at her waist, she mustered up all her strength and speed before she switched position with him, pinning him against the wall. She placed her left hand on the wall, shielding his face. Then, she covered his mouth with his right hand before she kissed the back of her hand, pretending like she was kissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew she had to switch positions with him. After all, he was injured. If he stood outside, his blood would be easily noticed. Fortunately, although he was tall, he only needed to bend over for Natalie to block his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bewitching man’s dark blue eyes widened in surprise. However, he regained his senses in the next moment and put away the hidden weapon in his hand. Then, he gently held her waist as though she was his lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s body stiffened in discomfort when she felt his hand on her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing her reaction, the man’s eyes flashed with a hint of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She didn’t hesitate when she pinned me against the wall earlier, but now she’s shy?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look carefully! We must find D!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Footsteps approached, and Natalie felt as though her heart was going to leap out of her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s only experience with kissing came from Oliver. Moreover, she was always in a passive state when they kissed. She had no idea how to kiss, so she could only recall Oliver’s actions and mimicked them as kissed the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, the scenes of Oliver kissing her were vivid in her memories, and she could easily recall them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Babe…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as a group of tall and burly men arrived, they witnessed Natalie’s self-directed intimate scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What the hell? Hey, get a room! This is a hospital!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What in the world! They were kissing in a hospital!&#34;</p>
