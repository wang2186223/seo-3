                <p>“She’s not my friend!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Who the f*ck needs you to do that for my sake?!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Rosy quietly disinfected the cut and put a band-aid for Natalie, Natalie rose to her feet and asked, wanting to confirm the matter, “You really won’t protect her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you need to even ask? Why the f*ck would I protect her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt like he was going to be driven insane by Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright, then wait for it,” Natalie said before she left the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Oliver trying to get out of bed again, Rosy hurriedly stopped him. “Don’t move! I can’t let you mess with your body like this! Do you want to end up disabled in the future?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she continued to say to appease him, “Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on your wife. I promise you that not a strand of hair on her head will be harmed!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not have to go far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence did not leave and was sitting on the bench in the hospital corridor with a resentful expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cadence,&#34; Natalie walked over and said, “I forgot to tell you something earlier.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence stood up and said arrogantly, “You want to apologize, right? Save it! It’s too late, and I won’t accept it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence was not tall. She was only the same height as Natalie despite wearing a pair of four-inch high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It seems like you’ve misunderstood,” Natalie said with a chuckle, “I wanted to tell you to f*ck off!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence stared at Natalie incredulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This woman is too audacious!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m his wife. We’re legally bound together. It’s my responsibility, obligation, and right to take care of him,” Natalie said as Cadence’s smile crumbled, “On the other hand, Miss Cadence, you’re just an acquaintance. What right do you have to tell me to get lost?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie continued, &#34;You ruined my husband’s dinner, but I didn’t say anything earlier because I was trying to be civilized.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence stomped her foot angrily, and the sound of her high heels attracted the attention of several nurses nearby. She said, “Hey, who do you think you are to speak to me like this? You’re just the illegitimate daughter of the Watson family! I’m the only daughter of the Aura family!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie chuckled softly. “Who am I? I’m his wife!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if you’re his wife? You’re no different from a decorative piece. Sooner or later, you’ll have to make way for me! Do you know that the Aura family is his support? The position of his wife will eventually be mine!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘So the Aura family is Oliver’s ally?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie naturally knew it was common for people in high society to force alliances for mutual benefits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Aura family was one of the top ten elite families in Country S, even surpassing the Harrington in Paykston. If Oliver wanted to bring down the Harrington, the Aura family was undoubtedly the best ally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No wonder Cadence knows our marriage situation. She must have known his identity long ago. Coupled with his face, it’s no wonder she’s so infatuated with him…‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew that Cadence was just the beginning. In the future, there would be many more women like Cadence pursuing Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps if Natalie truly liked Oliver, her heart would have been pierced by Cadence’s words. Fortunately, she had always been clear about her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Natalie genuinely liked Oliver, those words that Candace had just said would be enough to pierce her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said indifferently, “Then, Miss Cadence, please wait until you become Mrs. Windsor before you speak to me like this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You… You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence was so furious that she could not speak. It was her first time meeting a woman who dared to defy her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cadence, you ruined the dinner I prepared for my husband. As his wife, I can’t allow you to enter the room today,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Natalie was usually very mild-tempered. However, she would not show mercy to those who deliberately made things difficult for her. Moreover, being around Jane also made her stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Candace scoffed. “Let’s see you try and stop me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Candace knew that Oliver’s bodyguards were aware of his relationship with Aura family. As such, she was confident they would not dare to stop her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alas, Candace seemed to have forgotten that she had just been dragged out of the room. Unsurprisingly, when she approached the door, the bodyguards blocked her way expressionlessly, looking as immovable as a mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon sensing the mocking gazes directed her way, Candace was naturally humiliated and angry. Before she left, she shouted, “All of you, just wait and see!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Rosy, who had witnessed everything, could not help but clap her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That was amazing, Natalie!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another nurse chimed in, “I knew that you and Mr. Windsor are a couple, but I didn’t know you are married! Both of you have a really great relationship.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the doctors and the nurses here assumed that Natalie was Oliver’s girlfriend due to how young she looked. None of them expected that she was his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was rendered speechless by those words. She thought to herself, ‘I think you need to see an ophthalmologist. How did you see that we have a great relationship?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie was very calm when dealing with Cadence earlier, faced with Rosy, she could not help but feel embarrassed. “Dr. May, don’t tease me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, I really mean it!” Rosy said before she turned around excitedly, wanting to recount the verbal war to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie tried to stop Rosy, but Rosy spoke incredibly fast, not giving her a chance to interject at all. Before she knew it, Rosy had already finished telling the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy said, filled with praise, “Hey, your wife looks very gentle, but it seems like she’s also fierce. How amazing. She’s gentle, but she knows how to defend herself. Let me tell you, it’ll be difficult for you to find another wife like her!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dr. May...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quietly tugged at Rosy&#39;s lab coat, trying to stop Rosy. She felt extremely embarrassed. At the same time, she stole a glance at Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Oliver had heard everything earlier. Not only did he have a good hearing, but the room was quiet and the door was ajar. He thought that the way she had referred to him as her husband was very pleasing to the ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smiled slightly and beckoned her over. “Come here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled for a few seconds before she finally walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Rosy tactfully left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had just reached the side of the bed when the man who had been lying down suddenly sat up. Without any warning, he reached behind her head and pulled her down before kissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver seemed to have gotten better at kissing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Natalie’s shock, she seemed to have gotten used to his breath and closeness. She found that she did not reject him like used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Oliver ended the sweet kiss, he saw Natalie staring at him in a daze. Seeing the expression on her face, his feelings began to surge again.</p>
