                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry! I... I forgot my breakfast,&#34; Natalie explained, pointing to another plate of sopas on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A delicate film had formed on the surface as the soup cooled, concealing the escaping steam. Yet, once disturbed, the soup beneath maintained its warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, didn&#39;t you...find my cooking...repulsive?&#34; Natalie glanced at Oliver and muttered with a hint of discontent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If becoming a supermodel was her dream, then culinary delights were her passion. She delighted in bringing joy to others through her delicious creations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Oliver constantly found fault with her dishes, only to secretly devour them when she wasn&#39;t looking!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver regarded Natalie with an expressionless face, his handsome features carrying an air of aloofness as if his actions were entirely commonplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, it is shameful to waste food, so Mr. Windsor reluctantly eats it,&#34; Liam explained, standing beside Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been some time since Oliver exhibited such an appetite, and Liam thought that Natalie was quite impressive indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he say that! Natalie suddenly felt that Liam might not be as kind and approachable as he appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any objections?&#34; Oliver gazed at her icily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope!&#34; Natalie hastily grabbed her breakfast and said, &#34;I&#39;ll have breakfast upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Retreating to her room, she let out a sigh of relief and happily ate her breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she recalled Oliver&#39;s initial response to the sopas. It was quite strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it seem like he was almost eager for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t figure it out, and suddenly, flashbacks from the previous night flickered through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated on Oliver&#39;s lap, she felt the strength of his thighs beneath her, their skin nearly touching through the thin barrier of clothing. Such proximity and shared warmth... It was utterly maddening!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on her desperate ploy from the previous night, she couldn&#39;t help but reconsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver must despise her intensely, yet he hadn&#39;t killed her outright. It seemed like a stroke of divine intervention!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing her breakfast, Natalie took her plate downstairs and found that Oliver was absent. She hurried to the kitchen, cleaned her dish, and placed it back in the sterilizer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Natalie received a call from Sienna as anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the call connected, Sienna unleashed a barrage of insults, hurling vile names at Natalie—&#34;slut,&#34; &#34;bitch,&#34; &#34;a pretentious fraud,&#34; along with menacing threats like &#34;I&#39;ll kill you one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie held the phone away from her ear. Sensing that Sienna had said her piece, she replied calmly, &#34;Sienna, have you finished? Once you are, I have something to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t confess everything today, I&#39;ll make sure you regret it!&#34; Sienna bellowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie&#39;s narrow escape last night, Sienna was beaten and scolded by Brian, losing all dignity in front of the prostitutes and subordinates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to terminate the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Sienna laughed derisively. &#34;Natalie, who do you think you are? Can you afford the five million penalty fee? The Watson family sold you. They won&#39;t give you a penny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t pay the penalty fee, but I wanna terminate the contract,&#34; Natalie stated calmly. &#34;Sienna, when I returned to the company last night, I happened to see you and Mr. Zayn from the finance team getting intimate in the office. Your clothes were barely covering you, and it was incredibly provocative. I wonder how your husband would react if he found out about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna&#39;s husband was a hot-tempered company CEO. If he ever discovered Sienna&#39;s infidelity, he would undoubtedly beat her and cast her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, how dare you threaten me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the phone, Natalie could sense Sienna&#39;s intense desire to kill her. Unfazed, she continued, &#34;I&#39;ve sent an audio clip to your email. Take a listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna, with an expression of deep embarrassment, opened her email and began to listen to the conversation that started playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[How much did you give Sienna?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[One million or so! Honestly, you&#39;re not the first woman Sienna has given to me.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sienna, though our industry has its tacit norms, there are boundaries we shouldn&#39;t cross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine if I were to publicize this audio clip. Would that persuade you to reconsider your path? Facing potential expulsion by your husband and likely dismissal from your position might just necessitate a career shift. Maybe it&#39;s time to reevaluate your choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie! You wouldn&#39;t dare post it! What is it that you want from me?&#34; Sienna was fraught with panic, astonished by Natalie&#39;s sudden display of shrewdness after being under her thumb for six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dad has vested you with full control over my affairs, including the power to execute a contract termination,&#34; Natalie declared. &#34;End our contract, and the events of today will be kept confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well! I&#39;ll terminate the contract!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Sienna terminate Natalie&#39;s contract, she would not only be burdened with the hefty five-million-dollar but also risk incurring the fury of CEO Robert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sienna had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently swore to herself that she would, at some point, eliminate this troublesome girl from her life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To outmaneuver Sienna&#39;s potential machinations, Natalie opted not to meet her in person. Instead, she requested that the termination contract be mailed directly to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Natalie held the termination contract, adorned with Sienna&#39;s handwritten signature and the embossed seal of G Entertainment, that reality truly dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart fluttered with elation, yet she restrained herself from leaping around the room in pure joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment forward, she was no longer bound by the company&#39;s constraints and exploitation. She was free to pursue her dreams with fervor, earn money through her own endeavors, and support her younger brother independently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie snapped a photo of the termination contract and shared it with her best friend, Jane Watkins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane came from the prestigious Watkins family in Paykston. However, their fortune dwindled overnight, plunging them into destitution. Jane&#39;s father met a tragic end, while her brother suffered severe injuries and sought treatment in Moalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane, who was once the queen bee of Paykston&#39;s social scene, fell from grace and found herself barred from traveling abroad. Despite numerous men vying for her affection, surprisingly, none managed to win her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane quickly replied: [Great! What&#39;s your next move?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: [The Top Avenue is next month. I&#39;ll take on some jobs to earn money in the meantime, and then I&#39;ll leave the Watson family with Lucas.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane: [Count me in to help.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly afterward, Jane sent a link to Natalie. It was an advertisement for a car model recruitment event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This large-scale car show was the most anticipated event in the second half of the year in the country. The main sponsor was the RisingKing Group, and the remuneration was generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, there was a catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Car show models typically donned revealing attire, and other than on the runway, Natalie rarely accepted such exposure. But she needed money now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would simply opt for conservative outfits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie swiftly completed the online registration and sent a kiss emoji to Jane: [Thank you, Jane.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane: [That&#39;s all right. We&#39;re in this together.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unwavering support and care from Natalie&#39;s friends filled her once desolate soul with warmth. These lovely and wonderful people were the sunshine and motivation in her life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With renewed hope, she practiced even harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every morning at six, Natalie would wake up and go for a jog. After her run, she&#39;d find a cozy nook to stretch and practice her runway struts. Under the warm spray of her shower, she would stand in front of the fogged-up mirror, eyes ablaze with determination, rehearsing pose after pose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, having wrapped up his own morning workout, couldn&#39;t help but notice that familiar figure perched in the corner of his regular route once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had one leg casually draped over the railing, the other firmly planted on the ground below. Her torso softly inclined, as if hugging the leg resting on the rail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her long, lean, perfectly straight limbs and slender waist, she was an irresistible sight to behold for anyone passing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you up to again?&#34;</p>
