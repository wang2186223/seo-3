                <p>Natalie’s brain seemed to have stopped working at this moment. She could only shake her head frantically, driven by her instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you&#39;re my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, you promised not to force me…” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smiled coldly as he asked, “Is this your first time?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s face turned red immediately. At the same time, a thought appeared in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If I say no, will he let me go?…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In any case, Oliver’s words further confirmed to her that he was drunk. After all, she had already told him that she had never kissed Adrian before, so how could she have slept with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that there was no response, Oliver’s gaze turned even icier as he asked, “Have you ever been with Adrian?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head vigorously, frightened by his cold demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s gaze lingered on Natalie’s lip, which was rosy and moist now after being kissed by him. He laughed with a hint of bitterness as he asked, “You really hate me, don’t you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don’t! Why would I hate you for no reason?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had never met such an unreasonable and domineering man before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But you only married me for money, right? In fact, you don’t want to be my wife at all. You won’t even let me touch you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie really felt like she could not communicate with him at this moment. However, she still said, “Oliver, our marriage was never built on love. You should know that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver laughed. “So you don’t love me. Do you like me even a little?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned in confusion, and she felt a sense of unease. “What does it matter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next moment, Oliver lowered his head to her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver! What are you trying to do?” Natalie screamed as she pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isn’t it obvious?” Oliver asked in return. He had always been calm and composed, always in control. However, for some reason, the woman in front of him always made him lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her silently. Her eyes were slightly wet, and she bit her lip so hard that it seemed like it was going to bleed at any moment. He growled, “Why are you crying?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s vision was blurry from the tears as she glared at him fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Stop crying!” Oliver said sternly, trying to cover up the distress he felt upon seeing her in such a state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sniffled, trying to hold back her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Can’t I even cry now? Dictator!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her silently for a moment before he suddenly flipped away and lay on the space next to her. He said, “Get out!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly got up, scrambling away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn’t you tell me to get out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was angry, but she was more afraid of provoking him. Nonetheless, she could not hide the resentment in her voice at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, why weren’t you so obedient when I told you to kiss me earlier?” Oliver asked as he sat up. If it was not for his red face, it would be hard to tell that he had drunk at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie cursed inwardly, ‘Bast*rd!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back to bed!&#34; Oliver ordered expressionlessly, as though he had not just told her to leave a while ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, I want to sleep on my own tonight! You reek of alcohol!” Natalie said, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You’re disgusted because I‘m drunk? I thought you said you’d be good to me and. Take care of me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Of all things to remember when he’s drunk…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had never been patient. Seeing her refusal, he got up and carried her back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie cried out in fear, &#34;Oliver, let go of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed her on the bed, but thanks to the bed’s softness, she did not feel any pain at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that, he got into bed as well, hugging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you’re my wife. I should be the only man in your heart. You can only like me! You must like me!” Oliver said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frightened, Natalie hurriedly nodded. However, she thought to herself, ‘I don’t like you at all!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After obtaining the response he wanted, he released her from his hold. She quickly covered herself with the blanket and moved to the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the commotion, Oliver had already sobered up. When he smelled the alcohol on himself, he frowned in disgust. Without another word, he made his way to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bedroom and bathroom were only separated by one door, and the sound of running water soon filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sat on the bed, fuming. However, after a while, she still went downstairs and got him a glass of water. After all, he must be dehydrated from drinking so much alcohol. Although he was a jerk, she was his wife, and Liam also entrusted her to look after him. Moreover, there was no point in getting angry at a drunken man.</p>
