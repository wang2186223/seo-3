                <p>&#34;So you didn&#39;t call me out this afternoon?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie mused, &#39;That makes sense! Moreover, if Oliver set me up, he wouldn&#39;t bother to rescue me! This is Hailey&#39;s doing. Although I was suspicious at that time, I was too scared of Oliver to not follow the order.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry that I blamed you before...&#34; Natalie said, feeling apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to sleep,&#34; Oliver said, lying down again. He thought, &#39;What else can she do apart from apologize?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, can I sleep with the light on? A small one is enough,&#34; Natalie asked tentatively. Even after the revelation, the darkness still scared her and kept her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Oliver said. But meeting her pitiful gaze, he asked, &#34;Are you still afraid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Natalie nodded frantically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver slapped the spot next to him on the bed, casually offering, &#34;Come here. You can sleep on the bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes bugged out in shock, and she shook her head immediately. &#34;Uh, no thanks, I&#39;m good right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I disgust you?&#34; The same odd irritation he felt when he saw Natalie ask for a separate blanket came back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, I&#39;m a restless sleeper,&#34; Natalie said, making an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She&#39;s really a good liar!&#39; Oliver thought to himself, annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t believe she could resist him. &#34;Ten seconds. If you&#39;re not over here, you&#39;re out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him, sighed after a moment, and then dragged her blanket over slowly, thinking to herself that it was already three in the morning. She figured she wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep for long anyway, so she might as well tough it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a feeling that if she refused him, he would definitely be angry. Another proof that he wasn&#39;t acting like himself that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie finally lay on the bed, the bed barely dipped, as if she weighed nothing. In other words, even if she tossed and turned, she would not disturb his sleep. However, her unique sweet scent was distracting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the lights were turned off again, and the room returned to darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie slept on the edge of the bed. Although there was quite a lot of space between her and Oliver, she could keenly feel his presence. Despite his cold exterior, his body heat was warming her up even from such a distance. She didn&#39;t know why, but her fear disappeared and was replaced by a different kind of tension. However, it did not take long before she gradually fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Natalie&#39;s soft breathing in her sleep, Oliver was wide awake, staring at the ceiling. He turned to his side. In the dim moonlight, he could see Natalie&#39;s exquisite face. Flashbacks of her pitiful gaze and her lips touching the corners of his lips played in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver cursed under his breath, got up, and left to take a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver returned half an hour later, Natalie was still sleeping in the same position. Perhaps she had been too frightened tonight, even in her sleep, she was frowning. It didn&#39;t undermine her beauty and only made her look like a fragile and exquisite article.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her for a moment before leaving to get the first aid kit. Kneeling at Natalie&#39;s side of the bed, he gingerly brought her arm out from under the blanket. Her skin was delicate and soft, marred only by the cuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver thought, &#39;I was gonna get married as Grandmother wished anyway. It&#39;s not too bad to marry such an interesting and beautiful pet.&#39; As he tended to her cuts, he mused, &#39;As long as she&#39;s obedient, I will keep her and spoil her as a pet...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie woke up at dawn. Due to her adventure in the woods, she felt sore in her waist and back. She also noticed that the cuts on her arms did not hurt as much as she had expected. Natalie was confused as she was certain that she had not tended to them yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her mind cleared slightly, she finally remembered that she was on Oliver&#39;s bed. If memories served, she had slept at the edge of the bed. But she was lying in the middle of the bed at the moment. The spot next to her was empty. Oliver was gone. She reached out and touched the warm sheet that carried Oliver&#39;s unique scent, blushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She covered her face, wondering how she had moved to the middle of the bed, but nothing came up. After all, she was a heavy sleeper. Soon, she quickly lifted the blanket and checked her clothes. She sighed in relief when she saw that nothing was out of the ordinary. Before she could relax fully, Oliver&#39;s voice made her tense up again. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in your flat chest,&#34; he taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fully dressed Oliver walked out of the closet with a cold expression. Nobody could tell from his indifferent exterior that he moved Natalie to the middle of the bed at night and woke up with her in his arms that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just checking,&#34; Natalie said sheepishly. She felt bad for jumping to conclusions and misunderstanding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored her and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clicked her tongue and looked down at her chest. &#39;Flat chest? I&#39;m a C cup!&#39; she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry and the others were seated on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat alone on another couch. He leaned on the couch lazily with his legs crossed as he tapped at his phone. As usual, his face was hidden behind his mask, enhancing his aloof and elegant vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at the crowd and felt that Oliver was deliberately putting on a façade for the others. Those who looked down on him had no idea about his true strength at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting next to Adrian, Hailey smiled gently and said teasingly, &#34;Natalie, you and Mr. Oliver are so lovey-dovey. Look. You&#39;re even wearing matching clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the morning, the maid had brought Natalie a white half-sleeved dress with black prints. She looked graceful and elegant in the dress. As for Oliver, he had always liked dark clothes and was wearing a black shirt with white stripes. At first glance, it looked like they were wearing matching clothing, even though it was not intentional. Nonetheless, they still looked good together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie glanced at Oliver, he happened to look up, and their eyes met briefly. She quickly averted her gaze, feeling a little uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Oliver found their matching clothing was a fancy coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian clenched his fists, annoyed by their matching clothes. He agreed with Hailey. Natalie was fickle and immature. It hadn&#39;t been long since their break up, yet she had already started playing a loving wife for Oliver!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, you&#39;re Adrian&#39;s girlfriend. Although they&#39;re close in age, Oliver is still Adrian&#39;s senior. It&#39;s not appropriate for you to make fun of him, right?&#34; Natalie said, deliberately bringing up the fact that Oliver was Adrian&#39;s uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s smile froze, but she could not refute Natalie&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile flashed across Oliver&#39;s face over Natalie&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Edwin asked, &#34;Natalie, where did you go last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Hailey coldly and replied, &#34;Well, didn’t you know the answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would I know? Natalie, I was worried about you all night. I even went out with Adrian to look for you. You shouldn&#39;t run off. This isn&#39;t your house. More importantly, you made everyone worry,&#34; Hailey said with a hint of reproach, sounding like an elder sister educating her naughty younger sister. Her tone wasn&#39;t harsh, but she effectively shifted all the blame to Natalie.</p>
