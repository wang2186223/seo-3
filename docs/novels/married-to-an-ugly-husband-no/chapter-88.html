                <p>When Natalie brought the food in, the aroma permeated the room immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Rosy and Wyatt happened to be in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy asked Wyatt in a low voice, “I thought he’s a very picky eater and doesn’t eat much?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt shook his head and replied, &#34;He only likes to eat the food she cooks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How disgustingly sweet…” Rosy said teasingly, pretending to shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt rolled his eyes at the drama queen next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled the table attached to the bed out before she carefully placed the food on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned. “Hey, what is this? Why does everything taste so bland?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending some time with Oliver, Natalie also had a grasp on Oliver’s preferences. She knew he liked heavily seasoned food. However, she deliberately made something that was easier for his stomach since he was still recuperating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You’re still injured and recuperating. Moreover, this is your first meal after the surgery. It’s better to have something light,” Natalie said. Seeing that he was still frowning, she continued, trying to coax him, “When you’re fully recovered, I’ll cook whatever you want for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed coldly, which could be considered an acquiescence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rosy secretly showed Wyatt a thumbs-up. Previously, no one could persuade Oliver at all, but Natalie did it with just a few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you have eaten, right? Why don’t you join me and Rosy for a meal later?” Wyatt suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, I cooked extra food earlier. If both of you don’t mind, why don’t we eat that?” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why would we mind? It sounds great!” Wyatt agreed immediately, exchanging a glance with Rosy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy chuckled and said, “Thanks, Natalie! I happen to be starving!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glared at the two people who seized the opportunity to eat Natalie’s food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Are they worthy of the food she made?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt and Rosy pretended not to notice Oliver’s displeasure. After all, since Natalie cooked, she had the final say. Moreover, with his pride, they knew he would not stop them from eating in front of Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to leave to bring the extra food over, Oliver suddenly called out, “Natalie!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver put down his cutleries before he said arrogantly, “Feed me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: !</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy May: ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: ...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy doubted her eyes and ears at this moment. Was the usually overbearing and aloof Oliver acting… cute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the contrary, Wyatt, who had experienced such scenes, was very calm now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You can clearly eat on your own,” Natalie said, blushing. After all, there were another two people in the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think I got injured?&#34; Oliver asked, not wanting her to serve the other two people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt thought to himself, ‘But she wouldn’t have been in danger if it was not for you…‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking that he had taken a bullet for her and sustained multiple injuries to protect her, Natalie felt guilty once again. She pursed her lips and walked to the bedside before she picked up the cutleries, assuming the role of a caregiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Oliver looked at the two people sitting on the couch with a smug expression on his face.</p>
