                <p>The room was silent, made it even worse by Oliver’s overwhelming pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared to speak, and only the sound of breathing could be heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his left hand in his pocket, Oliver beckoned to Natalie with his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as his voice fell, the two servants quickly withdrew their hands from Natalie as though they had been shocked. They were so afraid that they did not even dare to look at the man with the murderous aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson had yet to finish applying makeup on Natalie’s face. The powder was smeared on her face, not fully blended. Red marks could be seen on her swollen cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned fiercely beneath his mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie could sense Oliver’s terrible stormy mood as she approached him. She glanced at him before she quickly lowered her head, too afraid to look at him. His aura now seemed even more terrible than that time he shot Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie hissed when she felt a touch on her cheek. The force was not heavy, but her injured face was extremely sensitive now. She instinctively looked up at Oliver in the confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver withdrew his hand. Seeing her wince in pain, he gave up on wiping the powder off her face. Then, he asked, “Who hit you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These three words shook the Watsons’ hearts. All of them remained silent, too afraid to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Robert’s hands trembled uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver asked again, “Who hit you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These three words were like a murder weapon to the Watsons, but to Natalie, they were filled with protectiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey bit her lip and thought to herself unwillingly, ‘Why does he treat me terribly but treat her so well? She doesn’t deserve it!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to reply, Hailey interjected, quickly shifting the blame to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, Natalie was disrespectful to my father earlier. My father lost control of his temper and accidentally hit her. It was not…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was a father’s prerogative to educate their children, but Oliver did not think so. He sneered and asked, “Disrespectful? Tell me. How was she disrespectful?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened slightly. After all, Oliver rarely said so many words. Moreover, when she left the house earlier, he seemed unhappy with her. Why did he suddenly seem to care?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey hesitated. She did not know how to reply. She could not come up with anything for the time being. After all, it was related to Natalie wanting to expose to truth about their marriage. She naturally could not tell Oliver about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver shifted his gaze to Robert, and Robert turned pale immediately. He could only follow his daughter’s lead and said, “Oliver, this girl has no control over her words. She doesn’t know how to speak properly. There’s no point talking to her. I don’t want you to listen to vile words. Don’t worry. I’ll discipline her properly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver remained expressionless as he rested one hand on Natalie’s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stiffened before she relaxed. This gesture made her feel like he was protecting her, and his presence was like a reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Discipline her? She’s my wife. Do you think you’re worthy of disciplining my wife?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert, Mrs. Watson, and Hailey’s faces turned pale as soon as they heard these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that Oliver intended on seeking justice for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then what do you want to do, Oliver?” Robert asked, sweating profusely. He had mistreated Natalie and beaten her for years. However, this was his first time regretting doing so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that he intended to hold Natalie accountable for his words. “Mr. Windsor, what do you think would be an appropriate response?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored Robert. Instead, he removed his hand from Natalie’s shoulder as he gestured at Robert with his chin and said to Natalie, “Go ahead. Hit him back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?” Hailey exclaimed in disbelief as she looked at Oliver in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Mrs. Watson were equally shocked. Their eyes were widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does she dare to hit her father?!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned slightly and did not say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert did not dare to speak, but he glared at Natalie, silently warning her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey could not stand the fact that Oliver was so protective of Natalie to the point where he wanted Natalie to hit her father. She said, “Oliver, I think we should drop this matter. After all, how can a daughter hit her a father?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What right do you have to tell me what to do?” Oliver asked frostily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was extremely furious, but there was nothing she could do. After two encounters with him, she knew that he was even more arrogant and domineering than the rumors suggested. However, it was also because of his temperament that she was even more jealous of Natalie when she saw him defending Natalie. She wanted that special treatment for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Hailey said as politely as she could, “Oliver, I’m Natalie’s elder sister.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed contemptuously upon hearing Hailey’s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was thoroughly embarrassed. Her cheeks flushed red, but she could only clench her hands tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie could tell that Oliver was growing impatient, so she approached Robert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert instinctively took a step back, but Oliver was watching nearby, so he had to stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Mrs. Watson warned in a low voice, “Natalie, hitting your father will bring divine retribution!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not pay attention to Mrs. Watson. She stared at Robert as she lifted her right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of fear and humiliation, Robert closed his eyes. However, after long time, the slap did not fall. He opened his eyes in confusion only to see that Natalie had put her hand down and returned to Oliver’s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let it go, Oliver. He’s not only my father, but he’s also Lucas’ father. I can’t hit him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Natalie really wanted to slap Robert. She was disgusted by his hypocritical face, but she still had to consider Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they first came to the Watson family, Robert truly loved Lucas, his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was young at that time, and he admired his father greatly. If it were not Mrs. Watson and Hailey’s schemes and Lucas constantly contradicting Robert to stand up for Natalie, Lucas would’ve been the beloved young master of the Watson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Lucas was still young. Natalie did not know how he truly felt about their father. However, as his sister, she felt that she had to consider Lucas as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned around and said to Hailey, “Hailey, so what if you’re my older sister? Are your trying to pressure Oliver with your seniority over me? Please remember that if you end up marrying Adrian in the future, you’ll have to address him as ‘Uncle’.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is she speaking up for me?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that, Oliver and Natalie left. Soon, Oliver left the Watson family with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, everyone in the Watson family’s house heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she had recovered, Mrs. Watson said, vexed, “Did you see how proud that wicked woman was earlier?”</p>
