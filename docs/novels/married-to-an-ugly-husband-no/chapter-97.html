                <p>Natalie’s voice grew softer and softer with each word until the final two words were barely audible, just like the sound of a mosquito.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver heard her clearly, but he intentionally asked, “What did you say?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’m asking you why you’ve been kissing me so often lately!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Are you lonely? This is too absurd!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s left hand continued holding her waist as he kissed the corner of her lips. He saw her eyes widen in surprise. After a beat, he asked, “Am I not allowed to kiss my wife?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘When did you start treating me like your wife? I don’t want to be your wife. It’s better if you treat me like a decorative piece!‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie naturally did not say those words out loud. She had a feeling that saying them was tantamount to seeking death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had always been sensitive to people’s emotions. She could naturally sense the subtle change in Oliver’s attitude toward her. However, she did not know what she did not make him change his opinion of her. In any case, she had become aware that Oliver had some interest in her, but she was unsure to what extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver continued to hold her in his arms as he asked, “By the way, it’s been so long now but you still haven’t learned how to catch your breath?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hasn&#39;t been that long!&#34; Natalie protested, feeling like he had just insulted her ability to kiss. It was just like when he called her ‘stupid’ in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mischievous grin appeared on his face immediately, and he said, “Oh? I guess we need to practice some more then…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Natalie could respond, Oliver kissed her fiercely again. At this time, her attention was not on the kiss. She was shocked by the grin she had just seen on Oliver’s face. Most importantly, it held no contempt, mockery, or arrogance. Instead, it was filled with warmth! At this moment, she had a surreal feeling as though she was thawing the ice around him. She felt slightly moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was kissed twice in a row, and her lips felt a bit painful. At this time, it suddenly dawned on her that they were still in the living room. Although the servants had tactfully left the living room, the house’s layout was quite open. This meant that the servants in the dining room could easily see what they were doing as long as they turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie instinctively looked in the direction of the dining room and saw a few maids. When they saw her looking at them, they quickly averted their eyes and pretended to busy themselves with cleaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, it was only natural for the servants to be curious. After all, all of them assumed that Oliver would give Natalie a hard time after she married him. Unexpectedly, he did not do that. He even hugged and kissed her in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“O-okay, that’s enough!” Natalie said as she forced herself to stand up. Despite her weak legs, she quickly retreated several meters away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver could not help but chuckle. It contained a hint of arrogance and wildness, which was extremely captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She’s so adorable!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you want to learn to shoot, I’ll personally teach you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You, you’ll personally teach me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Are you very happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“… I shouldn’t have mentioned this to you at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie decided to forget about this matter, thinking that Oliver would forget about this matter in a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had just come downstairs after her workout when Liam approached her and said, “Young Madam, Miss Cadence is here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Oliver was in a video conference, and the servants had been instructed not to disturb him when he was working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was Cadence or another person, Natalie knew that someone who could come to Rosewood Estate must have a close relationship with Oliver. She was the nominal lady of the house, after all, and it was her duty to receive guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Liam led the way, he said, “She’s in the kitchen.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie arrived at the kitchen, she saw a graceful figure standing at the counter, diligently chopping vegetables. Her movements were awkward; it was obvious that she had very poor skills in handling knives. She felt that Cadence’s skills were an insult to the high-quality knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cadence heard the sound of someone approaching, she looked up. Upon seeing Natalie, she said provocatively, “I’m here to make lunch for Windsor. Since he’s willing to eat the cheap food you made, I’m sure he’ll love the food I make for him!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence was a typical spoiled young lady who had no interest in household chores. Before coming here, she had taken lessons from a top chef. Not only that, but she also went for a full-body spa treatment and had her makeup done by a famous makeup artist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Cadence for a few seconds before she reminded, “Miss Cadence, the potatoes… Please peel them properly before cooking them. Not only is it unhygienic, but it’ll also affect the taste of the food…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence glanced at the potatoes and sighed inwardly. She had cut the potatoes into pieces earlier, thinking that it would not be noticeable. She did not expect that Natalie not only noticed it but also pointed it out bluntly. Needless to say, she felt embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that!” Cadence said. Then, she pointed at Natalie and said, “Come here and help me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head without hesitation and said disdainfully, “Miss Cadence, forgive me for being frank, but your knife skills are an insult to the vegetables…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How dare you!” Cadence shouted, losing her temper, “You’re just someone whom Adrian abandoned! If it weren’t for his grandmother, Windsor wouldn’t have married you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence had investigated Natalie. She knew that Natalie was just an illegitimate daughter of the Watson family. If it were not for an agreement made in the past, there was no way Natalie could have married Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence suddenly smiled, saying, “Rosewood Estate isn’t a place people can come at will, and yet, I can come and go as I please. What do you think it means? It means that I hold a special place in his heart!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie lowered her gaze. She recalled the time she was stopped by the security guards when she returned to Rosewood Estate. Based on the fact that Cadence could enter without being stopped, she knew that Cadence’s status was special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reason told Natalie that she should not be affected by Cadence’s words and actions. Although their marriage was only nominal and her feelings for Oliver were only gratitude and from her promise to be good to him, she could not help but feel uncomfortable and suffocated. Moreover, in recent days, Oliver had constantly reminded her that she was his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Natalie did not say anything and turned to leave the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing this, Cadence smiled triumphantly, thinking to herself, ‘This is what happens when you force your way into the Windsor family!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The main building of Rosewood Estate had an elevator, but it was rarely used. However, now that Oliver was temporarily bound to a wheelchair, it was finally put into use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Oliver entered the dining room, he saw Cadence sitting at the table. He looked around and discovered that Natalie was absent. He asked, “What are you doing here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence lowered her head shyly as she said coyly, “My father asked me to visit you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence liked Oliver, and she was not bothered by his cold treatment. That was why she did not take it to heart when he told her to get lost at the hospital. However, she really could not stand it at that time when she saw Natalie taking care of him when he was injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not think much of it. It was normal for Cadence’s father to show his concern. He looked at the food on the table silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were baked potatoes, butter chicken, prawns, pan-fried salmon, and German leek and cheese soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was slightly puzzled. These did not seem like what Natalie would usually make for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s eat,” Cadence said with a smile as she arranged the cutleries for Oliver. She looked at him in anticipation, waiting to be praised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver suppressed his doubts before he took a bite of the butter chicken. In the next moment, he spat it out immediately.</p>
