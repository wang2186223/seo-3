                <p>“She owes her marriage to Oliver to us, but instead of being grateful, she comes back flaunting her power!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy, about my position as the main model...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Enough!” Robert roared angrily, “It’s just a modeling gig? So what if you didn’t get the main position?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was still thinking about Natalie’s earlier words. He knew that they were not just meant for Oliver, but for him as well. She was telling him that she did not fight back because of Lucas. In other words, she was reminding him to treat Lucas well. Otherwise, she would not show mercy the next time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dad, how could you yell at me?” Hailey had been spoiled since she was young and had never been scolded by Robert before. Now that she was scolded for the first time, tears welled up in her eyes immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver treated her coldly today, and she had to watch him protect Natalie. Then, not only did she fail to obtain the main position, but her father also yelled at her. The more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey ran upstairs, crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hailey!” Hailey&#39;s mom anxiously followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haily&#39;s mom saw her daughter huddled on the bed, crying. She thought it was because of the car exhibition, so she said soothingly, “My beloved daughter, you have to be more farsighted. When you marry Adrian, you’ll get the support of the Harrington family… With such a powerful backer like the Harrington family, is there anything you won’t be able to obtain in the future?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey stopped crying immediately, and a hint of cunning flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Once I marry Adrian, I’ll be the young madam of the Harrington family, an in-law of the prestigious Windsor family. At that time, everyone will fawn over me, not Natalie! As for Oliver, since I can snatch Adrian away from Natalie, there’s no reason why I can’t snatch Oliver away from her…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun shone brightly outside the Watson’s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The summer heat intensified the pain on Natalie’s swollen face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver turned around, he saw her carefully using her delicate hands to shield her face from the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek and extravagant sports car parked outside the Watson family&#39;s opened its gull-wing doors, revealing the spacious interior and top-of-the-line fittings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get in the car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh, did you change your car?” Natalie asked, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what she remembered, Oliver usually drove the Rolls-Royce Phantom. When he was driven by Charles, he rode in the Maybach, and sometimes the Bentley Continental. All in all, all his cars were luxurious but low-key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why? You don’t like it?” Oliver asked as he got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were three garages in Rosewood Estate lined with various luxury cards, and they were just a small part of his collection. A man’s love for cars was just like a woman’s love for bags; they were never enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not!” Natalie said, shaking her head as she got into the car, “I just thought that flashy cars like that suit Isaac’s style more…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And what style is that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An inexplicable sense of displeasure rose in Oliver’s heart when he heard Natalie evaluating another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blinked. She hesitated for a second before she replied truthfully, “The playboy style…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely noticeable smirk appeared briefly on Oliver’s face. He was somewhat satisfied with this answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don&#39;t tell Isaac I said that,” Natalie whispered, worried about what might happen if Isaac got upset and gave her a hard time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver could see through her little thoughts. He pressed a button, closing the gull-wing doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt much better when the cool air blew on her face. She adjusted her position discreetly so the air could blow directly on her swollen cheek.</p>
