                <p>Oliver was very proud that he did not lose his temper at this time, showing his great tolerance toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lucas is sick. Any emotional fluctuations can affect his condition, which is why I hid it from him,” Natalie said. She pointed at his face before she continued, “Moreover, you’re not wearing a mask today.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, his lack of a mask made things more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Oliver felt that his face was bothersome, becoming the perfect excuse for her to deny his existence. He looked at her face, recalling her extraordinary gentleness with Lucas. He had never seen that side of her before. Before he knew it, as though he was possessed, he asked, “What kind of man do you like?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought she misheard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Charles happened to walk over from the distance and heard Oliver’s question. For a moment, his expressionless mask cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt like he was going crazy. He even began to wonder why he came to visit the brat, Lucas, today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Did her really ask me what kind of man I like? I must have misheard. He’s always so indifferent to everything. How could he have asked such a question?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Isaac was here, this was the kind of show he would have liked to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles, send her back,&#34; Oliver said, intending to go for a drive alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was not dressed in his work suit today, so she assumed he was not going to work. She asked, “Aren’t going home?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Home...’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this word, Oliver fell into a momentary daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since his mother passed away, home was where his younger brother, Arthur, was. Later, when Arthur left to find a woman, Rosewood Estate became nothing more than a place to stay. It was no different from his other properties. He only returned to Rosewood Estate more often because of Natalie. However, for the first time in a long time, he felt that Rosewood Estate was home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver returned to his senses, he did not respond to Natalie. Instead, he got into another car that Charles had driven over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he left, Charles asked, “Young Madam, did you upset the young master?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so,&#34; Natalie replied, scratching her head, “Well, something minor happened in the hospital earlier, but I’ve already explained it to him. He doesn’t seem like a petty man…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles thought to himself, ‘He’s indeed not a petty man. However, when it comes to his own woman, how can any man be magnanimous? It seems like she doesn’t have any romantic feelings toward him…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Charles felt that his boss was a little bit pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Maybach was an off-road vehicle, suitable for rugged mountain roads and grasslands, but it could not compare to a Pagani in terms of speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sped through the city. The black car raced along the coastline like a roaring beast. The irritation not only did not subside, but it kept growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out for a drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was shocked when he received Oliver’s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He asked me out for a drink?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after his accident when he almost became disabled, Oliver still remained calm and composed. As such, people wondered if Oliver was even normal. Isaac could not imagine what had happened today that made Oliver ask him out for a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked up, wondering if the sun really rose from the east today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since it was the first time Oliver took the initiative to ask him out for a drink, Isaac naturally had to plan it well. He even invited a few young masters, including Wyatt and Barrett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett knew he had misspoken last time, so he apologized to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, someone suggested, “Just drinking is boring. Why don’t we play a game?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of games have we not played before?” Isaac said, knowing that Oliver had something on his mind and was not in the mood to play games, “Let’s just chat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett said with a smirk, “What do you want to chat about? You either talk about work or women. Since we don’t understand anything about your work, let’s talk about women.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone said, “Windsor lives an ascetic life. Is he even interested in talking about women?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s fine. Let’s talk about women,” Oliver said with a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just an instant, the noise private room fell silent, and everyone turned to look at Oliver in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Did he really agree to talk about women?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This man has never shown any interest in women and is even suspected of being in a relationship with Isaac actually… wants to talk about women?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt looked at each other, communicating with their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Is he having trouble with love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: It likely has something to do with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: So then should we talk about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: Are you trying to get yourself killed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the colorful lights, Isaac’s expression was troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How should we start?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the other young men were oblivious to this matter and happily discussed their female companions. They also talked about which female celebrities looked good and how they pursued women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver held a cigar between his fingertips, looking very unenthusiastic as he listened to the men talk about their experiences in pursuing women. He could not help but feel their strategy would not work at all. He was confident that using money to entice Natalie would only fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt were also talking to the others, but in fact, they were constantly sneaking glances at Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver dropped another bomb, asking in his cold and indifferent voice, “Am I not attractive?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt communicated with their eyes again, wondering if Oliver had taken the wrong medicine today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac suddenly recalled the time when Oliver asked if he was annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Natalie is really amazing…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt reacted first, saying, “How can that be? Are you mocking every man out there?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If you’re not attractive, then what about all the other men? With these words, you’re belittling me and Isaac as well…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver continued to ask, “Then, is there any woman I’m not worthy of?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not!&#34; Isaac replied without hesitation. He knew without a doubt that ‘any woman’ was 120% Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the flickering lights of the neon signs, an annoyed expression appeared on Oliver&#39;s impeccably handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving it some thought, Isaac offered his advice on love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, a woman’s heart is hard to guess. There are women who seem aloof but are actually very passionate inside. Some may appear cute and innocent, but in reality, they’re scheming. Then, there are those who seem tolerant and magnanimous but are actually quite sensitive. However, regardless of the type of woman, as long as you, an outstanding man, make your move, they will all kneel in front of you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stared at Isaac for a few seconds before he said disdainfully, “Shut up.”</p>
