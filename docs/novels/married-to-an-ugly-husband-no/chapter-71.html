                <p>“Oliver?” Isaac called out when he saw Oliver looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have someone send her home,” Oliver said with a gloomy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac immediately stood up and went outside to give instructions. When he returned, he saw Oliver holding a cigarette in his hand, making his way out. However, after a few steps, Oliver stopped abruptly and turned to ask him with a dark expression, “Am I annoying?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not care about his image at this moment and shook his head vigorously, replying, “How’s that possible? There are so many women lining up to throw themselves at you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Look, is that young miss from the Aura family sitting there and waiting for you?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression did not ease as he thought to himself, ‘But Natalie isn’t one of those women…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“By the way, where are you going?” Isaac asked. He had just arranged for someone to send Natalie home. Oliver could not possibly plan to go home as well, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m just getting some fresh air, damn it! Stop following me,” Oliver said irritably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a blink of an eye, he disappeared from everyone’s sight, striding away with his long legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone could not figure out Oliver’s thoughts. Just a few minutes ago, he was murderous, and then, he suddenly asked Isaac to arrange for someone to send Natalie home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett grabbed his blond hair and asked with a pitiful expression, &#34;Isaac, did I say something wrong?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You’ve spent too many years abroad and have become stupid, haven’t you? By the way, have you seen that woman before?” Isaac asked with a sigh, attributing Barrett’s foolishness to his young age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett shrugged and replied indifferently, “I don’t think so.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s enrolled in Sense Academy. It’s the same as you, right?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sense Academy was part of Sense International University, which was where Barrett was studying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it! Windsor’s woman is still a student?! And, she’s also my schoolmate!” Barrett exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence, who was sitting at the side, scoffed and said disdainfully with a sour expression on her face, “She’s just a plaything. What’s the big deal?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Isaac kindly advised, “Cadence, he’s a married man now. You should give up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence sneered. “They’re just husband and wife in name. It doesn’t count.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Cadence refused to listen, Isaac did not say anything more. In the past, he had also thought that Natalie was just a trophy wife, but he was proven wrong. Now it seemed more like Natalie was treating Oliver like a trophy husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie went out, she ran into an employee of Starry Hotel, who told her that they were sending models from RK Media home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other party was dressed in the hotel’s uniform and had an identification card. Moreover, the vehicle clearly belonged to the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For this reason, Natalie did not refuse. She thanked the other party and got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when she arrived at Rosewood Estate that Natalie found that something was amiss. The employee did not seem surprised when she mentioned Rosewood Estate earlier, as though they had already known it. Moreover, the guards did not stop the car. After verifying the license plate, the security guards simply let them through as though they had already expected the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, she had a feeling it had something to do with Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Liam saw Natalie sitting on the couch, lost in thought, he could not help but ask, “Young Madam, are you waiting for the young master?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie returned to her senses and shook her head, telling Liam to go to bed first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Could it really be Oliver? Wasn’t he angry at me? Why would he still arrange for someone to send me home?’Could it really be Oliver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie really could not understand that unpredictable man at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Oliver did not return to Rosewood Estate at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The autumn car exhibition made a huge splash on the Internet. Under normal circumstances, a car exhibition would not draw so much attention. However, this time, there were many articles regarding the car exhibition.</p>

                <p>The number of headlines related to the autumn car exhibition’s Scene B even surpassed those of Scene A even though there were many international supermodels in Scene A.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, netizens were hotly discussing Adrian and Hailey’s engagement, spurred by Noah’s confirmation on Instagram that her brother would soon hold an engagement banquet with his fiancée.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the attention on this matter was quickly overshadowed by news of the mysterious tycoon who bought 31 Hummers. There were also many online trolls, and some people soon noticed how Oliver bought 31 cars while Adrian bought 30. They quickly concluded that Oliver was deliberately provoking Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had a habit of browsing the Internet. After all, she was in the fashion industry and had to keep herself updated with the latest happening. She scrolled through many of the posts and did find any photos of Oliver. It seemed like he had been cropped out of every picture. Without any photos, he was only referred to as ‘the mysterious tycoon’, and this only made people even more curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to the sale of the 31 Hummers, Natalie also gained more fame. Many well-known accounts on Instagram posted photos of her that day, and many netizens left comments under those photos.</p>

                <p>[Her name’s Natalie. She’s about 1.76 or 1.77 meters tall. She’s currently enrolled in Sense International Academy. She’s a rising star in the industry. However, the burning question is: How did a rookie manage to obtain the position of main model?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This comment was clearly trying to cast doubt on Natalie. However, other netizens were not fooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Even if she’s a rookie, she’s talented! People should look at the other models of Scene B for answers instead.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[That’s right. Why are the other models, who supposedly have more experience, so mediocre?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both sides continued to engage in a heated battle online. At the same time, many fans also tried to look for Natalie’s Instagram account, wanting to look at more of her photos. Alas, no one found her Instagram account. After all, her Instagram account was not verified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At night, Natalie received calls from several modeling agencies, asking if she was interested in signing with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie declined all of them. She knew they were interested in signing her now not only because of her looks, but her 15 minutes of fame. In her opinion, this was not enough; she did not have chips for bargaining and negotiations now, and if she signed with them, they would eventually take advantage of this and exploit her. For this reason, she decided to wait until the finale of Top Avenue before, hoping to gain more exposure. She needed to be famous enough to negotiate with the modeling agencies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not return to Rosewood Estate for several days, and he did not even send people to pick up his meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam could only look at Natalie hesitantly and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had a hunch that Oliver was still angry, so she did not dare to mention the matter of visiting her brother for the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was clear with a few stars dotting the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver got out of the car, reeking with the smell of alcohol. Clearly, he had drunk a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master,&#34; Liam called out worriedly. He knew that Oliver did not go on a business trip but had deliberately stayed outside. He did not expect Oliver to come back so drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where’s the young madam?” Oliver asked when he saw Liam approaching with two servants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam paused for a moment. After all, this was the first time Oliver had addressed Natalie as ‘young madam’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Master, she’s already gone to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell her to come down.&#34;</p>
