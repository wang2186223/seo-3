                <p>Upon hearing Sienna mention the contract, Natalie felt angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last year, through her own efforts, Natalie had made a name for herself in the modeling world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her father, Robert Watson, forcibly signed her into SY Entertainment Company. The result? SY Entertainment Company handed all the resources that should have been hers to Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a year, Hailey went from being unknown to a somewhat famous model, even buying an award for &#34;Top Ten New Star Models in the Country&#34; last year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie was almost sidelined, becoming an unknown model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suspected that the company&#39;s intention for her to walk the runway was a facade, while the real plan was to please the person in charge of &#34;Top Avenue&#34; by sacrificing her dignity. Perhaps after the show, it might even involve more than just walking the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey also made it to the finals of &#34;Top Avenue,&#34; but her skills were lacking. To make it into the top three, she would need to curry favor with the show&#39;s production team through backdoor deals. Natalie speculated that Sienna wanted her to sacrifice herself to help Hailey advance on &#34;Top Avenue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I&#39;m thirsty. Can you make me a cup of hot coffee?&#34; Hailey suddenly said to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; Natalie pointed at herself in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, if not you, then should I go?&#34; Sienna knew that Hailey was the company owner&#39;s beloved daughter, while Natalie was the unprivileged illegitimate daughter, so she fawned over Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna was Natalie&#39;s agent after all, and Natalie didn&#39;t want to conflict with her over such a trivial matter. Natalie made the coffee and handed it to Hailey, saying, &#34;Your coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey looked up and smiled, giving Natalie a bad feeling. In the next moment, the coffee was spilled onto Natalie by Hailey, staining her hands and her white shirt with brown coffee marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey exclaimed, showing concern, &#34;Natalie, why are you so clumsy? Did you get burned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna, relieved that the coffee had spilled entirely on Natalie and not on Hailey, scolded Natalie sternly, &#34;Natalie, you can&#39;t even pour coffee properly, so clumsy! Hurry up and make Hailey another cup!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smiled slightly at the corner of her mouth. Fortunately, she had anticipated that Hailey might play tricks, so she had purposely added ice cubes to the hot coffee, making sure it wasn&#39;t scalding. Hailey, still smug, thought she had scalded Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie returned with the second cup of coffee, Sienna had already left the office. Natalie looked at Hailey and said, &#34;Hailey, aren&#39;t you afraid that if I please Mr. Evans and the investors, I&#39;ll win the championship on &#39;Top Avenue&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey smirked, &#34;Natalie, do you know why the company agreed to let you participate in the competition in the first place? Let me make it clear to you: your existence is only to pave the way for me! After you defeat those strong opponents, you will lose to me, and the championship will be mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?! Natalie widened her eyes in shock. No wonder over the past year, the company had not allowed her to participate in any activities but had permitted her to join &#34;Top Avenue.&#34; This was their plan all along!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was extremely angry and determined to leave this company that drained her dreams and exploited her. But the breach of contract fee... she would absolutely not pay it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to say something, Hailey suddenly raised her hand and splashed the coffee onto herself, screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey spilled coffee on herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Natalie was gonna ask when suddenly, a man&#39;s anxious low roar came from behind her. &#34;Hailey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall, handsome man burst into the office, pushed Natalie away, and nervously held Hailey in his arms. &#34;Hailey, are you OK? Did you get burned? Does it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man pushed Natalie so hard that she hit her lower back into the corner of the desk, and she was in severe pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the physical pain was nothing compared to the great heartache. Natalie felt as if someone had viciously stabbed her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie looked at the familiar man in front of her, those intense, nasty scenes from half a month ago came back haunting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was Natalie&#39;s ex-boyfriend, Adrian!</p>
