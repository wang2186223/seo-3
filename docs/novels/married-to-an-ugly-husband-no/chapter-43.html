                <p>Natalie turned and met Oliver’s cold gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, why are you here?” Natalie asked. Then, she said hesitantly, “Uh, I might have gotten into the wrong car…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wanted to go out and wait for the car that Liam sent, but she found that the door was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you stupid?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath to maintain her composure before she said, “How can you insult me like this?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How did you come back?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver was returning to the villa, he received a call from Liam earlier, telling him that Natalie had been waiting here since earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“By cab.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, do you know there are cab drivers who assault and kill female passengers?” Oliver asked, looking at her as though she was a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes, saying, “Those are just a few isolated incidents. Moreover, am I supposed to climb all the way up the mountain if I don’t take the cab?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don&#39;t you know how to call Liam?” Oliver asked through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This stupid woman still wants to argue with me!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie lowered her head and muttered helplessly, “I don’t have his number.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then don’t you know how to call me?” Oliver asked, frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glared at him and recalled his words in the afternoon. Then, she said angrily, “I didn’t want to talk to you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Say it again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I said I didn’t want to talk to you!” Natalie repeated her words. She would repeat them as many times as he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why should I call him? He said I don’t deserve to be in RK Media!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get out then,” Oliver said darkly, “Charles, stop the car!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, who was temporarily filling in for the driver today, stopped the car immediately and unlocked the car door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie got out of the car and began to walk. In the next moment, the Maybach sped past her, leaving her behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the car gradually slowed down, and Charles asked tentatively, “Mr. Windsor, should we wait for her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was very perceptive despite his impassive appearance. Moreover, he had followed Oliver for many years, so he understood the letter’s temperament quite well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to focus, Oliver threw his iPad aside and said, “Turn around. Ask her if she has realized her mistakes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles turned the car around and pulled to a stop. He got out of the car and walked to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Miss Natalie, Mr. Windsor is angry. Can you please apologize to him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stubborn once her temple flared up. She said, “I didn’t do anything wrong. I won’t apologize! I’ll walk back!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, Charles went back to report to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, let her walk then!” Oliver said before he ordered sternly, “Let’s go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away, Oliver looked at the rearview mirror that reflected the slender and delicate figure of a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was often aloof when faced with others. Despite all that, she still gave off a sense of softness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, Oliver said impatiently, “Stop. Turn back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was momentarily confused. When realization dawned on him, he hurriedly said, “Yes!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, the sleek Maybach turned around with flashing taillights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked confused when the Maybach stopped next to her and Charles got down to open the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Miss Natalie, please get in the car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie saw Oliver. His expression was dark and sullen; he was clearly still unhappy with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles said, “Please get in the car, Miss Natalie. Mr. Windsor…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver interjected, looking impatient, “Charles spoke on your behalf. You should listen to him and get in. I don’t care if you want to walk back, but if you encounter snakes, it serves you right.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver mentioned snakes, Natalie only hesitated for a moment before she got into the car. Then, she nodded and said sincerely, “Thank you, Charles.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Alright, Mr. Windsor, you’re the boss. Whatever you say goes!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam had been waiting outside for a while. When Natalie got out of the car, knowing that she did not have his and the house’s number, he quickly gave her the numbers. Then, he advised earnestly, “If you can’t reach me, you should call Mr. Windsor. After all, it’s not safe for a young girl like you to take a cab up the mountain. Luckily, nothing happened. However, what if you encounter a driver with bad intentions?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s heart stirred. Oliver had said something similar earlier about drivers with bad intentions. However, somehow, she was not resistant when she heard Liam’s words. She felt that his words made a lot of sense. With this, she realized she had been too angry earlier to realize that Oliver was worried about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He… Was he really worried about me earlier?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling guilty, Natalie looked at Oliver. He had already entered the house. A servant took off his coat, and he made his way to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you eaten? Should I ask the kitchen to prepare something?” Liam asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Has Oliver eaten?” Natalie asked. She finally remembered that she had not cooked for Oliver today because she was out. Could he have gone without a proper meal all day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mr. Windsor probably made do with something outside,” Liam said with a sigh, looking worried, “His appetite has never been good. I’ve only seen him enjoy the food you cooked for him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt even guiltier when she heard this. She said, “In that case, I’ll cook for him now. I’ll call him down when I’m done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then, I’ll have to trouble you,” Liam said with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Liam interacted with Natalie, the more satisfied he was. For this reason, he secretly contacted Oliver&#39;s grandma and reported the situation to her.</p>
