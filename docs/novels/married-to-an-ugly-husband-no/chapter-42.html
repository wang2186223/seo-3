                <p>“Natalie, have you signed with a company yet?” Isaac asked, trying to sign Natalie. He wanted to strike while the iron was hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Not yet,” Natalie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you think of our company?” Isaac asked as he leaned close to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver shook him away disdainfully, but Isaac was unbothered as he continued to say, “Considering your relationship with Oliver, I’ll definitely support you. With your qualifications, you’ll definitely be able to become an international supermodel!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an enticing prospect for all models to become an international supermodel. Moreover, RK Media was undoubtedly a powerful support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Natalie knew that Isaac was only saying it because of Oliver, and she did not want to owe Oliver anything. After all, it was always difficult to repay favors. She would take her time to look for a new agency. As such, she said, “Thank you for your kindness, Isaac, but I’ll have to pass.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was about to tell Natalie to sign the contract with RK Media, but upon hearing her words, he swallowed back those words and said, “She doesn’t deserve to be in RK Media.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I... I’ll definitely become an international supermodel based on my own abilities! There’s no company that I don’t deserve to be in, including RK Media!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie refused on her own initiative, she was still angry when Oliver ruthlessly denied her abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you know what you look like now?” Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?” Natalie had a feeling that he would not say anything nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Like an angry kitten, not frightening at all.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was dumbfounded. It was as though he had seen something extraordinary. This was the first time he had seen a woman challenging Oliver and survived it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She’s indeed different.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie ignored Oliver and bade farewell to Isaac before she made her way to the subway station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver pursed his lips, exuding a suffocating aura. He assumed she would tell Liam to send the driver to pick her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, are you really not going to see her off?” Isaac asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No!” Oliver said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So where are we going now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“To the mall.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“To buy clothes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac asked, puzzled, “Aren’t all your clothes custom-made? Why are you buying them at the mall?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Isaac impatiently, clearly telling him to shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men went to Paykston’s most famous department store. It was a luxury mall owned by RK Group. Not many people could afford to shop here, and most of the customers spent millions here, bringing substantial profits to the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver went to the women’s clothing section. He glanced around before he said to the salesperson, “I want this, this, this, this, and this. Wrap them all up for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson looked at the wealthy man in front of her and asked, “Sir, are you clothes for your significant other? What size does she wear?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s about 5&#39;7&#34; tall, and she wears a size S.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Oliver went to a few more stores and bought clothes in the same manner, requesting them to be packed and sent to Rosewood Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘5&#39;7&#34; tall? Isn’t that Natalie? Is that why Oliver’s expression worsened when Noah said that Natalie dressed shabbily?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clicked his tongue in wonder. He did not expect Oliver to be caring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac followed behind Oliver. He tried his best to hide his curiosity and asked seriously, “Oliver, what you say is clearly different from what you think. Why did you tell Natalie that she doesn’t deserve to be in RK Media?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac continued to say, “Although she doesn’t have any notable achievements now, her talents and abilities are obvious. It’s only a matter of time before she becomes famous. It’s clear that G Entertainment held her back in the past.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did I say I didn’t allow her to join RK Media?” Oliver asked. His expression darkened when this topic was brought up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“D-didn’t you?” Isaac stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She said it herself that she didn’t want to join RK Media.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That woman thinks I don’t know. She just wants to distance herself from me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So… So you were in a bad mood earlier because she refused to join RK Media? Is that why you said she doesn’t deserve to be in RK Media? Just because of that trivial matter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosewood Estate was built on a mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, after taking the subway train to the station closest to the mountain, Natalie had to take a cab up the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, the cab driver was reluctant to take her, but he agreed after she offered him an extra hundred dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt a pang in her heart and felt increasingly uneasy as the numbers on the meter continued to increase. Then, another thing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were halfway up the mountain, the cab was stopped from going further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guards only knew that Oliver had gotten married, but they did not know what his wife looked like. As such, Natalie was stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m truly Mrs. Windsor!” Natalie said, trying to reason with the security guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There&#39;s no order from above. No unauthorized people are allowed to enter the Rosewood Estate,” the security guard firmly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they were in a deadlock, the driver did not want to wait any longer. He said, “Miss, why don’t you just get off here? I still have other things to attend to.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could convince the security guards to let her in, it would take her about an hour to walk back. Since it was not too far, she paid the fare and got out of the car. Then, she looked at the four security guards stubbornly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chubby security guard tried to persuade her, saying, “Miss, I’ll be frank with you. This year alone, there have already been eight women who claimed to be Mr. Windsor’s wife. You’re the ninth one. You should leave. We won’t let you in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Women are claiming to be Oliver’s wife?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was in disbelief, considering the rumors about Oliver that were swirling outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Even if there are unsavory rumors about Mr. Windsor, he’s still the legitimate heir of the Windsor family, after all. How can he lack women who want to get close to him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But I&#39;m different. I am really Mr. Windsor&#39;s wife!” Natalie protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard clicked his tongue disapprovingly and said, “You’re certainly different compared to the first woman. At that time, she claimed to be Mr. Windsor’s wife when Mr. Windsor had yet to marry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed, frustrated that they would not listen to her. She only had Oliver’s phone number, but she did not want to ask for help from him when he had just disdained her abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If only I remembered Liam’s number…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The matter dragged on until evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby security guard advised, “Miss, you should leave. You’re still young, and you don’t know what’s important. You should focus on your studies. That’s the right thing to do. Stop daydreaming about marrying into a wealthy family and pretending to be someone’s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not even that young,” Natalie said helplessly, “I really live here. If you don’t believe me, you can call Mr. Liam.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had already said these words about 13 times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that it was almost 8 PM, the security guard finally relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Fine. Since you look so pitiful, I’ll help you make the call! I won’t believe it until I see it with my own eyes!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after the call connected, the security guard’s expression gradually froze before it was replaced by one of shock. Then, he nodded vigorously and said, “Alright, alright!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the other three security guards looked at the chubby security guard curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under their watchful eyes, the chubby security guard bowed ninety degrees at Natalie and said, “Madam, I sincerely apologize for not recognizing you. It wasn’t intentional!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His companions were shocked by these words and hurriedly apologized as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This woman looks like a high schooler! How would we know she was telling the truth?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It&#39;s alright,” Natalie said, waving her hands. She knew they were just doing their job, after all. She asked, “So can I go in now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Madam, please wait. Mr. Liam said he’ll send a car to pick you up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, okay. Thank you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting dark now, and Natalie did not feel safe walking alone at night. After all, she was unfamiliar with this place and was worried about losing her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a Maybach stopped outside the guardhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thanked the security guards and got into the car. However, as soon as she took a seat, she sensed that something was wrong.</p>
