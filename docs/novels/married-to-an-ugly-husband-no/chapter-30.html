                <p>Natalie looked at Hailey and said, &#34;You told me yesterday that Oliver was looking for me? That was why I went out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I&#39;m Adrian&#39;s girlfriend. Why would Mr. Oliver ask me to give you a message?&#34; Hailey said innocently, &#34;Anyway, you can ask Mr. Oliver. He&#39;ll tell you that he didn&#39;t ask me to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Hailey asked with feigned shock, &#34;Natalie, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re trying to sow discord between me and Adrian. Are you trying to cause a misunderstanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, stop slandering Hailey!&#34; Adrian scolded angrily. He thought, &#39;She&#39;s definitely trying to create a rift between me and Hailey. She must be jealous!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had already expected that Hailey would not admit setting her up and would shift the blame to her, but Adrian&#39;s reaction was unexpected. Ever since their break up, he had shocked her over and over again, as if there was no limitation on how low he could stoop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry seized the opportunity and reprimanded, &#34;Oliver, tell your wife to stop! This is her first visit to our house, but she&#39;s stirring up trouble everywhere. Now, she even wants to blame Adrian&#39;s girlfriend for her own fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir Windsor, I may do wrong. But it has nothing to do with Oliver,&#34; Natalie said, defending Oliver. He saved her last night, so she owed him one. And he should not be reprimanded for her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver remained silent as he had no intention of getting involved in the argument. However, he looked at Natalie. She had been frightened last night, yet she was standing up against Henry to defend him. His heart could not help but skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you talk back to me! Watch your tone!&#34; Henry slammed his hands on the table and rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My tone? Then what about Adrian? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s inappropriate for him to call me by my first name? And one more thing, I just married Oliver and it&#39;s unfair to accuse him because of my mistake. If anyone should be responsible for this, I think it should be my family, like my dear sister right here. You shall give her your lecture.&#34; Natalie turned to Hailey with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are? How dare you act so arrogantly in my house?&#34; After the roar, Henry ordered a servant, &#34;Throw this ignorant woman out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Natalie with a triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver rested his head on one hand and spoke up, his voice low and cold. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare to kick my wife out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin raised an eyebrow. A knowing smile appeared on his face briefly. Of all the years he&#39;d known Oliver, this was the first time Oliver defended someone. Even Arthur had not received such a treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry questioned angrily, &#34;Don&#39;t I have the right to discipline my daughter-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver only scoffed and looked at Henry as a fool. Pointing at a servant, he ordered, &#34;Bring me the surveillance footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Surveillance footage?!&#39; Hailey mused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked, she looked around and did not see any surveillance cameras. She prayed that Oliver was just bluffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the servant returned with a USB drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, here it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, only one place in the main building had installed surveillance cameras. That was the area near Oliver&#39;s bedroom. After all, he did not want people stepping into his territory without his knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the USB drive was plugged into the television, the curved and large screen TV immediately started playing the scene from yesterday evening as the camera completely recorded the conversation between Natalie and Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver wants to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps he took a liking to me? In any case, I&#39;ve already delivered the message. He&#39;s waiting for you in the west wing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at Hailey in shock, especially Henry and Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry felt embarrassed for misunderstanding Natalie while Adrian was shocked that his gentle and lovely girlfriend had deceived him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver leaned back on the couch a little and said lightly, &#34;Hailey, for the record, I have no interest in you at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s expression changed drastically. She hurriedly explained to Adrian, &#34;I did ask Natalie to go out yesterday, but it was a harmless prank as a test for a couple&#39;s trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian looked at the cuts on Natalie&#39;s arms and was enraged. &#34;A harmless prank? Natalie almost died yesterday!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was not for Oliver&#39;s timely rescue, Natalie might have become the snake&#39;s dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey quickly approached Natalie and grabbed her hand before saying, &#34;Natalie, you know I meant you no harm. I&#39;ve always protected you, haven&#39;t I? You believe me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the eyes of the others, this seemed like a touching scene of sisterhood. Only Natalie knew how forceful Hailey was gripping her, her fingers digging into Natalie and her gaze filled with warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled her hand away and said, &#34;Then why didn&#39;t you say anything earlier? If Oliver didn&#39;t show us the surveillance footage, I would&#39;ve become the target of everyone&#39;s criticism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver walked over to Natalie&#39;s side. His silver mask glinted under the light, making his gaze look even colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With just one look from Oliver, Hailey shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room fell silent as Hailey&#39;s scheme was exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver said to a servant, &#34;Bring a hot towel over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the servant brought the towel over, he pointed at Natalie and said, &#34;Wipe her hands clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey looked at Oliver in shock and thought, &#39;How humiliating! Is he implying that I&#39;m dirty?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie obediently extended her hands and glanced at Oliver out of the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another servant stepped forward and said, &#34;Breakfast is ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at Natalie before walking out, and Natalie immediately followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Oliver didn&#39;t even bother to stay for breakfast and just left without a word, Henry felt humiliated and enraged, his face flushed. He said to the others, &#34;Eat your breakfast. We&#39;re going to visit Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Oliver and Natalie stepped outside, the gentle morning breeze blew past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unique scent of grass mixed with blooming roses and hibiscus that lined the sides of the road permeated the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had been waiting for them. When he saw the couple, he quickly opened the door of the Rolls-Royce for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at the front seat and hesitated for a moment before getting into the back seat. Due to Oliver&#39;s imposing presence, she could not help but feel cramped in the car. To ease the tension, she said, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you going to thank me?&#34; Oliver asked as he took off the mask, revealing his astonishingly handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback by his sudden question, Natalie started thinking. Since they came to the mansion, Oliver had not eaten much. So, she offered, &#34;Why don&#39;t I make you a big meal when we get back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s hand stopped tapping the armrest over her question. He asked, &#34;Do I look like I can&#39;t get food by myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, who was sitting in front, had to hold back his laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie muttered inwardly, &#39;He is impossible to please!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Oliver looked at the documents on his lap solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Rosewood Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning, Oliver changed into a fresh set of clothing and left the house. During the ride back, he was engrossed in reading the documents, seemingly very busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her short observation of him, Natalie was even more certain of her theory. She bet that Oliver was putting on an act in front of the Windsors and everyone else because he was bidding his time or he simply did not care what they thought of him.</p>
