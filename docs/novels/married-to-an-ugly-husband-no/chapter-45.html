                <p>Natalie had always ranked first in her major, and her teachers only had high praise for her. If it was not for her exceptional talent, how could she have become famous in the industry last year when she had just participated in a small show? Moreover, she was the only newcomer in that show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jane…” Natalie called out. She wanted to tell Jane that it was not just one game of pool. After a moment, she asked, “When are you free? I have something to tell you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is it urgent?” Jane asked. Her voice turned serious immediately, thinking that Natalie had something important to discuss with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not urgent, and nothing bad happened, but… it’s not suitable to talk about it over the phone,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was worried about Jane’s reaction once Jane found out that she was forced to marry Oliver on behalf of Hailey and that Hailey was now with Adrian. If she was not there in person to calm Jane down, she was worried Jane might go looking for Adrian with a baseball bat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were in high school, two foolish rich young boys took a liking to Natalie and Flora. The boy stalked and harassed them with lewd words. When Jane found out about it, she beat the boys up so badly that they had to be admitted to the hospital. In the end, the Watkins family had to intervene and resolve the situation. However, now, the Watkins family was in trouble, and there was no one to support Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What about next week? I have to go to Milan with my boss this week for a cover shoot.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Natalie was just about to leave the room when she saw Oliver standing by the door. His hand was on the doorknob as if he had just opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey, Oliver!” Natalie greeted cheerfully. She was in a good mood, and she could not help smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why were you screaming like a ghost?” Oliver asked. He had heard her screaming excitedly earlier. Curious, he could not help but put his work aside to take a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I passed the audition for RK&#39;s car model and will be the first one on the B stage!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, an inexplicable sense of pride rose in Oliver’s heart when he heard this. However, he feigned nonchalance as he said, “Oh.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Hmph! What’s with his attitude? Is he looking down on me again?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of anger rose in her heart again as she recalled Oliver’s words yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, I’ll prove to you that I can enter RK Media with my own abilities!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver only thought to himself, ‘What’s so shocking if you entered RK Media? If only you know that you’re the wife of the chairman of RK Group…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scorching summer sun shone through the dense tree leaves, leaving dappled shadows on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day of the finals for Top Avenue was drawing closer, just like the start of the school year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie received a phone call from Robert. As soon as the call connected, the middle-aged man roared at her from the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, get your ass back here immediately!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was already used to her father’s fierce tone. “What’s wrong, Dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert continued to roar, “What’s wrong? You terminated the contract with the company without permission, and you’re asking me what’s wrong? Come back and see me now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert’s voice was so loud that Natalie had to move the phone away slightly. Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw Oliver coming downstairs at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright. If Oliver agrees, I’ll come back,” Natalie said. She knew she had to face this sooner or later. It did not matter if she had to face it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver heard his name and looked at Natalie. “What is it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie ended the call and replied, “My father wants me to go back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?” Oliver asked nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don&#39;t know,” Natalie lied, not wanting to reveal her embarrassing family situation to others. Moreover, she had learned that no one would sympathize with her, so she might as well keep it to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Liam, arrange a car for her,” Oliver said coldly before he headed upstairs again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt restless so she did not notice Oliver’s mood. However, Liam, who had known Oliver since Oliver was a child, could tell that Oliver was angry just from Oliver’s tone alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After arranging the car for Natalie, he also prepared a few gifts for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Since you’re going back for a visit, you have to bring gifts…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, Liam!” Natalie said, but inwardly, she thought to herself, ‘Visit? No, it’s more like going back for a battle.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She naturally did not voice out her thoughts. She did not want to disappoint the kind old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam went upstairs and knocked on the door of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat in a luxurious leather chair, holding a cigar between his fingers. Smoke filled the air, blurring his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam naturally knew that Oliver was not completely indifferent to Natalie. He said, “Mr. Windsor, it’s her first time returning to her family after getting married. Won’t you accompany her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s going back to be scolded. Why should I accompany her?” Oliver said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, he had heard Robert shouting. However, since she did not say anything, he would pretend not to know.“She&#39;s going back to endure scolding. Why should I stop her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam knew Oliver’s temper, so he only sighed and did not speak any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood by the floor-to-ceiling window in the study on the second floor, watching Natalie&#39;s slender figure enter the Bentley before the Bentley drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed and returned to his chair to continue working. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not concentrate on the simple words and numbers in front of him. Moreover, he grew even more restless as time passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had told him that Natalie was not favored at home. He had heard how Robert had shouted at her and how Hailey had schemed against her while pretending to be gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not help but wonder if Natalie would be able to stand up to Robert and Natalie after she returned to the Watson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Even if it’s only in name, she’s my wife. Moreover, I intend to keep her as a pet. I can bully her, but no one else is allowed to bully her…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Liam, prepare the car!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Liam saw Oliver wearing a suit and holding the familiar silver mask, his face lit up with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watsons’ mansion was located in a famous area in Paykston. It had an excellent location, making it the preferred neighborhood for many celebrities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sweetheart, stop crying. My heart breaks when you cry,” Mrs. Watson said, comforting the crying Hailey, “Don’t worry. Your father will definitely seek justice for you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey asked pitifully with tears in her eyes, “Daddy, if Natalie does better than me in the future, will you like her more and dislike me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not!” Robert said without hesitation, “Hailey, you know the only reason I brought her back was so she could replace you to marry Oliver. I only have one daughter in my heart, and that’s you. Don’t worry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidentally, Natalie had just walked in and overheard the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Ten years… Oliver’s accident happened ten years ago. As it turns out, Dad brought me and Lucac back ten years ago only to use us… Everything was premeditated.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie laughed self-deprecatingly. She thought she would feel heartache, but at this moment, she was surprisingly calm. Her breath only hitched for a moment before she accepted this fact calmly. In fact, she even felt grateful after learning about this.</p>
