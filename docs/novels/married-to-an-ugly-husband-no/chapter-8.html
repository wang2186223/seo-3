                <p>Natalie retorted, &#34;You&#39;re wrong! Oliver is not ugly at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey scoffed, &#34;Not ugly? Don&#39;t delude yourself. It&#39;s widely known that Oliver is a notorious eyesore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to explain, Hailey abruptly ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt a bit disheartened, but she was eager to see Hailey&#39;s reaction when she discovered that Oliver was not only not ugly but actually quite handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s expression at that moment was sure to be priceless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nighttime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie received a call from her agent, Sienna White, who asked her to come to the company the next day for a job. It was the first time in six months that her agent had proactively arranged work for her. Natalie was excited and immediately went to find Oliver. After all, she could only leave with Oliver&#39;s approval. When Natalie found Oliver, he was sitting on the couch reading a financial magazine, looking relaxed and aristocratic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Oliver, Natalie spoke, &#34;Oliver, I mentioned to you last night that I am a model. My agent wants me to go to the company tomorrow for work. Can I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise not to disclose any of your information! I swear!&#34; Natalie was afraid he might not agree, so she immediately raised her hand to pledge. She didn&#39;t want to be trapped in this estate forever. She had dreams of being a supermodel, she wanted to work. She had a younger brother to take care of, she needed to earn money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked up, gazing into Natalie&#39;s beautiful eyes and seeing her eager expression. Feeling a bit moved, without much thought, he nodded in agreement, &#34;You can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s signing company was SY Entertainment Company, owned by her father, Robert Watson. When Natalie arrived at the company, she went straight to Sienna White&#39;s office, only to find another woman inside. A woman who made her feel sick just by looking at her. Hailey!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, long time no see!&#34; Hailey elegantly lounged on the sofa, her smile tinged with mockery. Natalie felt disgusted just seeing Hailey&#39;s smile. Hailey not only slept with her boyfriend but also used her younger brother&#39;s life to threaten her. Hailey was a bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Hailey, Natalie turned to Sienna White and asked, &#34;Sienna, what job do you have planned for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, it&#39;s been a while since you did a runway show. Tonight, All Night Club has a late-night show. Get ready to walk the runway,&#34; Sienna said warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sienna, All Night Club is a nightclub. Many of the girls there are prostitutes. Do I have to go there to model?&#34; Natalie was shocked. All Night Club was a famous nightclub, with exorbitant prices and a gathering place for the wealthy and elite of Paykston City, where countless shady deals took place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna persuasively smiled, &#34;Natalie, tonight many important people will be there, even the assistant director of &#39;Top Avenue&#39; show. This is a great opportunity for you to showcase yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sienna, is she going to this show tonight?&#34; Natalie pointed at Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna, as their agent with two talents under her wing, one being Natalie and the other Hailey, replied, &#34;Hailey is a popular model now, a favorite of the company. How could she go to a nightclub for a show? You, on the other hand, are an unknown model. How dare you compare yourself to Hailey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing her patience, Sienna stopped pretending to smile and ordered, &#34;Natalie, don&#39;t mess this up! Remember, you signed a contract with the company. If you don&#39;t obey, you&#39;ll pay a million dollars in breach of contract!&#34;</p>
