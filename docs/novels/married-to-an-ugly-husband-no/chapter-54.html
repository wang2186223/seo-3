                <p>She had no choice but to marry Oliver for money for her brother&#39;s life-saving surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beautifully wrapped gift box was violently thrown away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver never expected to hear such words when he returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought she missed him, but it turns out she married him solely for the money!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought her previous actions were seducing him, but now she said she didn&#39;t love him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver has only one word in mind: &#39;a joke.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the noise, Natalie turned around to see a tall and majestic man standing not far behind her. She quickly hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was wearing a tailored silver-gray suit. With broad shoulders and a slim waist, his long legs were tightly wrapped in dress pants, as if he had just come from a business meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handsome face appeared even more striking under the sunlight, but his eyes were filled with piercing coldness and mockery, like a sharp sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrifying as never before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you been here?&#34; Natalie stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even notice his presence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much did he hear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not long.&#34; Oliver took a step closer, his tall shadow enveloping Natalie. &#34;Since...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that your ex-boyfriend had sex with your sister.&#34; Natalie&#39;s petite face instantly drained of color, instinctively retreating. But the man accurately grasped her delicate chin. He was angry, expressionless, yet his fingers exerted great force. Natalie winced in pain, afraid that he would squeeze her chin too hard and crush it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t like me? Do you like Adrian then?&#34; Oliver&#39;s cold, mocking smile was even more terrifying than his emotionless face. It turned out that she didn&#39;t go to great lengths to please him, to seduce him, because she wasn&#39;t interested in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Married me just for the money? Huh?&#34; His voice was like the Grim Reaper. An unprecedented wave of fear washed over Natalie. She wanted to shake her head, but her chin was held tightly by him, rendering her unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you that desperate for money?&#34; He actually still wanted to take care of her and pamper her. It was ridiculous. Why would he keep a woman who had another man in her heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! I&#39;m desperate for money!&#34; Natalie admitted loudly, as if breaking a jar. She knew he wanted to humiliate her. Mentioning her &#34;ex-boyfriend&#34; specifically was meant to humiliate her, and mentioning her &#34;sister&#34; was also meant to humiliate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, many people can give up more for money. Marriage is just one of the common things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the fastest way to make money?&#34; Oliver bent down, getting closer. He saw her slightly furrowed brow, her fluttering eyelashes, delicate and beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s features were enveloped in the unfamiliar scent of a man, his breath brushing against her cheek. In the intertwining of their breaths, the distance became intimate. The unique fragrance of eucalyptus invaded her senses, along with his dominance and danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a strong discomfort, her mind went blank, and she asked, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To sleep with me!&#34; Oliver enunciated each word, &#34;Please me, and I&#39;ll give you money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, you’re shameless!&#34; Natalie&#39;s face instantly flushed, and without thinking, she raised her hand to slap him. Since they got married, she thought he wouldn&#39;t touch her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Oliver had received military training and was even better than an elite special forces soldier. He easily grabbed Natalie&#39;s wrist, swiftly turned her around, and pinned her in his arms, rendering her unable to move. The woman&#39;s body became as soft as a bundle, making one want to crush her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you are my wife,&#34; Oliver said with the most pleasant and cruel tone of voice, &#34;Serving me is your duty.&#34;</p>
