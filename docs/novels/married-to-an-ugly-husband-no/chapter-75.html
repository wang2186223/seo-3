                <p>&#34;Liam, it wasn’t me!” Natalie said with a blush, waving her hands. She had just told Oliver it was not her and was worried her lie would be exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Young Madam, all the servants had gone to bed last night. Who else could it be but you?” Liam said with a kind smile, “You’re the young master’s wife. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I’m not embarrassed. I just don’t want my lies to be exposed!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stared at Natalie with a hint of teasing as he crossed his legs. Although his posture was lazy, it was elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the look in his eyes, she only scoffed softly and pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flashed slightly when he looked at plump and rosy lips, thinking about the kiss last night. However, his gaze turned cold again when he recalled her rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you wear the ring during the car exhibition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie instinctively touched the diamond ring. The pink diamond glimmered dazzlingly in the morning light. Still embarrassed about the glass of water, she explained in a low voice, “It’d be too ostentatious to wear the ring during the car exhibition.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the unhappy expression on his face, she quickly added, “It’s not a slight against you! I just didn’t want people to gossip.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The custom-made was obviously very expensive. Natalie had yet to make her public her identity as Mrs. Windsor. Moreover, if her identity was exposed, it would also be difficult for Oliver to hide his secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to her explanation, the ice on Oliver’s face seemed to melt a little. However, he still wanted her to wear the wedding ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, he stood up and went upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had an exceptional memory. He remembered that among the jewelry he had given Natalie in the past, there was a platinum chain. When it was convenient for her to the wedding ring, she could wear it around the neck with the platinum chain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Oliver entered Natalie’s walk-in closet, his expression darkened. After a few seconds, he let out a bone-chilling laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Young Madam, the young master wants you to go upstairs,” a servant said to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned in confusion and followed the servant upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood in the walk-in closet, surrounded by towering cabinets on both sides that were filled with women’s clothing. He held a sky-blue chiffon dress in his left hand and a few small cards in his right hand. There was no sense of incongruity at all, but it made for a rather striking visual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw her, he did not wait for her to speak before he asked, &#34;Care to explain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, he flicked his wrist, and the cards flew over to Natalie. They were, in fact, tags from Natalie’s clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not think there was anything to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are you keeping them?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had seen them as soon as he came in. He even saw a piece of paper on the dressing table, listing the prices of the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does she plan to sell them later?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I plan to pay you back when I have money,” Natalie replied, “There’s no free lunch in the world, after all.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was taken aback by the lengths she had gone to just to distance herself from him. He wondered if she even remembered that she was his wife. She was legally bound to him, and it was his duty to protect her and take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are… are you angry?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not think that she had said anything wrong. Not only were they married only in name, but he also disliked her. In her opinion, he should be happy that she was maintaining a distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her as he picked up a pair of scissors from the side and ordered, “Remove all the tags from your clothes!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! There are so many of them…&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in shock. She even doubted if she had heard him correctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Remove them!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If you want to repay your debt, I’ll make sure you’ll be paying for it the rest of your life!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, there are too many clothes for me to wear,” Natalie said, attempting to reason with him. Even if she never wore the same outfit twice, she would still not be able to wear them all within a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver asked, “Didn’t you plan to visit your brother?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had spoken to Liam about it, and the latter had dutifully conveyed it to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes flashed as she waited for his response. It was as though she knew what he was going to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Oliver said, “After you’re done removing the tags, I’ll take you there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let alone the jewelry, even the cheapest designer clothes and bags were priced in the five digits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each tag she removed, Natalie felt as though her heart was being pierced. Initially, she even calculated the price as she removed them. She added them up one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘189,00…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘526,00’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘1,300,090…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘2,350,121…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She removed another tag with the number 980,000.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood nearby behind her. His face was expressionless as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After removing the tag, she closed her eyes tightly as her surging emotions gradually overwhelmed her. Finally, she threw the scissors aside and asked, “What do you want exactly? I can’t wear these clothes, I won’t wear them! I can’t repay you! Who do you think you are to threaten me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes reddened as she questioned him, like a cornered rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want you to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver trailed off, unable to finish his sentence. After a moment, he held her chin with his long and slender fingers, saying, “You won’t be able to repay it in this lifetime.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you eat what&#39;s mine, live in what&#39;s mine. Do you think you’ll be able to repay me?” Oliver said with a sneer. He did not say that since the debt could not be repaid, there was no need for her to repay it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you say that?&#34; Natalie glared at him angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Living at Rosewood Estate, eating in Rosewood Estate… Do you think I want this?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hated words like these the most. Hailey, Robert, and Mrs. Watson’s words echoed in her mind again at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you eat and wear what our family provides! It’s only natural that you do my bidding!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, the Watsons provide you with food, clothing, and shelter. Do you think these things come for free? You owe us!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your father has supported you and your brother for ten years! Don’t you know how to be grateful?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Debts must be repaid, and obligations must be fulfilled. In this world, nothing was free. If her own father was like that, how could Oliver, who was only her husband in name, be any better?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not trust Oliver and certainly did not believe he would give her these things without asking for anything in return. Alas, only if she had power would she have the confidence to speak up in this unequal marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do I want? I want you to owe me for a lifetime!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I want you to owe me for a lifetime. I want to make it impossible for you to draw a boundary with me!’</p>
