                <p>The master bedroom was luxurious and vast, nearly 2,000 square feet in size!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the door of the room, there was a small living room, and when she walked further in, she saw a king-size bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a walk-in closet, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire bedroom was decorated in an authentic Gothic style, filled with an aura of mystery and intrigue. It was nothing but stylish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To call it a bedroom wasn&#39;t accurate. It was practically a home!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie cautiously walked into the bedroom and looked for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver?&#34; she said, looking around. Yet she saw no one, though Liam had told her Oliver was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she saw a silhouette behind a huge floor-to-floor frosted glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought the silhouette was Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and approached, intending to talk to Oliver through the glass, as she wanted neither of them to feel awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I... I&#39;m Natalie...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting no response, she quickly said everything she wanted to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t like me. Rest assured. I won&#39;t bother you no matter what you do. But I do have a favor to ask... If that&#39;s OK.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still a student, and I wanna go back to school when I have classes. And I&#39;d like to visit Lucas every week. He&#39;s my brother. Can I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Natalie was also a finalist in a modeling competition called &#34;Top Avenue&#34;, which started the next month, but she didn&#39;t dare to make so many requests all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I heard that you avoid meeting people because you think you&#39;re ugly. However, I believe that being unattractive isn&#39;t something to be afraid of, as long as you have a kind heart...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just at that moment, Oliver came out of the bathroom and happened to see Natalie murmuring to herself against the frosted glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had smooth, golden, and waist-length hair, and she wore a pale blue house dress. Under the light, her earlobes were round and delicate, her neck slender and fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was so nervous that she didn&#39;t notice a man standing behind her at all. Then she heard a deep, cold male voice coming from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned and said，&#34;Who did you call ugly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, blending with the gothic decor of the room, was as resonant as a beautiful cello.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie screamed at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned around, she saw a half-naked man standing less than 6.5 feet behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was 5 feet 9 inches tall, and he was taller than her. She figured that he was at least 6 feet 3 inches tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seemed he had just finished showering. His wet black hair was still dripping, his chest muscles and his eight-pack abs chiseled. His V-line abs sunk into the towel around his waist, and he had broad shoulders, a lean waist, and slender legs. Everything about him was exuding a potent, masculine allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He beat those top male models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features were sharp and handsome, his lips were thin and sensual, his nose was prominent, and his eyes were cold and wild. He was chosen by fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In short, his face could drive any woman crazy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie screamed, &#34;Who... Who are you? Why are you here? And... Why aren&#39;t you wearing clothes?&#34;</p>
