                <p>&#34;Sir, I...&#34; the woman said in a soft voice. An expectant smile could be seen on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Wyatt nudged Isaac’s arm. The duo turned to look at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few people also turned to look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett had a particularly strong impression of Natalie. Not only because of her appearance, but also because she was Oliver’s woman. Most importantly, he had almost offended Oliver because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming that Oliver had yet to see Natalie, Isaac deliberately called out loudly, &#34;Sister-in-law!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned to look at Oliver’s reaction, he was shocked to see a woman sitting on Oliver’s lap. However, with just another glance, he saw the indifferent expression on Oliver’s face and Oliver’s gaze that was focused on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Tsk, so he&#39;s deliberately putting on a show for Natalie!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie finally found Oliver at the very end of the room and quickly walked over. He held a cigar in his right hand while his left hand casually rested on the armrest. She naturally saw the seductive woman sitting on his lap as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman thought that Natalie came to snatch Oliver away from her, so she quickly hugged Oliver’s neck, declaring her sovereignty as she asked, “What do you want?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not respond to the woman. She looked at Oliver, who was clearly not drunk, before she asked, “I thought you were drunk and needed me to pick you up?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked puzzled. However, after a moment, he glanced at Wyatt and Isacc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt looked sheepish while Isaac looked away, pretending like he did not know what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who are you? Does he need you to pick him up even if he’s drunk?” the woman asked as she sized Natalie up. It was too dark for her to see what Natalie wore, but judging by her conservative style, she did not seem like a wealthy young miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Oliver’s indifference, the woman grew even bolder, saying, “How are you related to him? Moreover, Isaac and Wyatt can send him home if there’s a need.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s eyes were focused on Natalie, carefully observing her expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Natalie; she had been tricked by Wyatt and Isaac. She did not expect that Wyatt, who seemed honest, to be just as cunning and playful as Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was a little upset. After all, she had been tricked out of the house in the middle night. She had to drive down the mountain alone and had been worried about getting into an accident. How could she not be upset when she arrived and discovered that it was all a prank?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Natalie said, “Well, if you’re fine, I’ll take my leave first.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Natalie turned to leave, the sound of glass breaking followed by a scream rang from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had pushed the woman aside, causing her to fall to the ground. She rubbed her knees in pain, but she did not dare to complain. Shards of glass from the wine glass and wine bottles lay next to her; they fell to the ground when Oliver stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tried his best to suppress his anger as he asked Natalie, “Are you going to leave just like this?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Huh? What’s the matter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Oliver’s anger, Natalie quickly thought about what she could have done wrong. She had only been for a few minutes; she did not think she had made any mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver let out a low laugh that sounded extremely chilling. A fire rose in his heart when he saw her clueless expression. He felt even more foolish about his actions. Without another word, he grabbed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s wrist and pulled her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to his long strides, Natalie had to jog to keep up with him even though she was quite tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called out, “Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver?&#34; Isaac called out in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys continue on,” Oliver said without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The duo quickly disappeared out of the room, leaving the others looking at each other in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored Natalie&#39;s call and continued walking toward the parking lot. He looked around but could not find the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I drove here,&#34; Natalie explained, &#34;Are you not going to stay back with the others? Do you want to go back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made the flames of fury in his heart rise higher. He released her hand and leaned against the Land Rover and asked, “Is there something wrong with your brain?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? What do you mean?” Natalie asked timidly. Seeing that he had drunk and that he was unhappy now, she was careful when she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver lifted her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze before he said mockingly, “You saw another woman sitting on your husband’s lap, and you were just going to walk away?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Uh, what right do I have to interfere with what you do? Can I even control what you want to do?’ Natalie thought to herself. In fact, she had no desire to control Oliver and did not care what he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Speak!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s silence further angered Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not why he was going crazy again and wondered if he was testing her. After a moment, she took a deep breath and said, “I have always been very clear about my position. I may be your wife, but you were forced into this marriage. We’re husband and wife in name only, so I can’t control what you do.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as soon as she finished speaking, she knew that she had made him even angrier. She asked, feeling helpless, “Oliver, what exactly do you want?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is he acting like an unreasonable child today?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised her chin so she could look at him and growled, “I want to like me, love me, and only have me in your heart!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at him in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You… Do…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was about to ask him if he liked her, but she stopped herself in time. She did not think it was possible for Oliver to like her. She had seen too many failed love stories and had experienced one with Adrian. She learned to keep her heart behind iron walls, unwilling to let anyone in. She really had no interest in romance now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to say?” Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie naturally had no intention of asking that question, so she said, “Don’t worry. I promised I’d be good to you and care for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I said I want you to f*cking love me!” Oliver shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He really likes to swear whenever he drinks…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought had just appeared in Natalie’s mind when Oliver leaned down and kissed her passionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her waist as they kissed, entangled with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been holding her breath as they kissed. When she felt like she was running out of breath, she quickly patted Oliver’s chest.</p>
