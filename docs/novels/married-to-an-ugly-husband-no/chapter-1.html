            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, if you want your dear brother to live, marry that monster from the Windsor family for me! I and Adrian will bless your union!” Hailey Watson sneered at Natalie Watson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie Watson looked at Hailey Watson’s smug expression, feeling both heartbroken and angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were half-sisters who shared the same father. Yet Hailey, green with envy over Natalie&#39;s beauty, never missed a chance to make Natalie&#39;s life hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only had Hailey seduced Natalie’s boyfriend, Adrian Harrington, but she had also slept with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was more outrageous was that Hailey was threatening Natalie with the life of her little brother, Lucas Watson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was Natalie’s beloved younger brother. They were very close, and six months ago, Lucas was diagnosed with leukemia, requiring a large sum for medical treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey threatened Natalie that if she did not marry Oliver Windsor in her stead, she would cut off the funding for Lucas’s treatment, essentially leaving him to die!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it that Oliver Windsor was a hideous, sickly weirdo who never appeared in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s forcing Natalie to marry Oliver was clearly meant to destroy her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s father was also aware of the situation but he condoned Hailey’s actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Natalie was so heartbroken and angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was too cruel, not treating her and Lucas like family at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And their father! He was too biased, not caring at all about her and Lucas’s feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Natalie had no choice. If she didn’t marry Oliver, her brother Lucas would die!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned to Hailey, “Fine, I agree. I will marry that monster Oliver, but you must keep your promise to fund my brother’s treatment and not go back on your word!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey sneered, &#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, seven silver Rolls-Royce wedding cars pulled into the Watson&#39;s place, ready to take Natalie to her wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your ride is here. Go!&#34; Hailey urged. The thought of Natalie marrying a hideous guy made her beam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey thought, &#39;The best way to torture a beauty is to make her marry a beast!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy heart, Natalie lifted the hem of her wedding dress and got into the wedding car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The procession made its way to Paykston&#39;s most renowned chapel, but the turnout was sparse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cars pulled up, Natalie stepped out, met by the gazes of dozens, their eyes filled with mockery or disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed they were here for the spectacle, not to offer well-wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was about to wed Oliver, the infamously unattractive man. The crowd was eager to check out how ugly was he and how terrified Natalie would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, hi. Where&#39;s Oliver?&#34; Natalie looked around but didn&#39;t see Oliver, so she asked Collin Charles who had sent her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor has something to do, so he can&#39;t be here today,&#34; Collin said, his voice devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned. &#34;What about the wedding then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re gonna have to proceed alone,&#34; Collin replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression turned sullen as she thought, &#34;I&#39;m gonna go through the wedding alone. That&#39;s absurd! Besides, what could possibly be more important than his own wedding? He must be doing it on purpose! Trying to humiliate me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs of the crowd grew into open sneers, their contempt for Natalie deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s absence in such an important event spoke volumes. He was either too ashamed to show his face or didn&#39;t value Natalie, his bride, at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, Natalie was the butt of everyone&#39;s jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the jeers around her, Natalie felt utterly sad and ashamed. She wished that she could just run away, but she didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Lucas&#39; sake, she had to swallow the humiliation and proceed with this ridiculous wedding all by herself...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at All Night Club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a lavish private room, three dashing and wealthy men lounged on a sofa, sipping drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large screen inside displayed a live feed of Natalie in her wedding gown, navigating the ceremony by herself in the church.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the three young men, the one who was clad in a white shirt and black trousers was Isaac Black, Oliver&#39;s right-hand man and confidant. In his arms were two stunning ladies in sexy outfits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing his eyes on the screen, he turned to the aloof man beside him, saying, &#34;Oliver, that woman on the screen is your bride, right? Damn, she&#39;s hot! Check out those long legs, the slim waist, and the booty! Is she a top international model or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was right, Oliver was watching at his own wedding live. Contrary to the rumors, he was nowhere near ugly. Among the three in the room, he was the finest, even hotter than a lots of Hollywood stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features were so chiseled and striking that they could captivate any onlooker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Natalie on the screen. Then he turned to the smiling Isaac and said with a nonchalant shrug, &#34;You like her? She&#39;s yours then.&#34;</p>
