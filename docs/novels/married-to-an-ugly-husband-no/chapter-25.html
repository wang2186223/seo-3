                <p>Charles was startled. &#34;Mr. Oliver, you forbid us to disturb you when you&#39;re in the cemetery. So I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned slightly. Charles reminded him that he wasn&#39;t acting like himself. He released Charles and hurriedly walked towards the main building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was confused. &#39;Why is Mr. Oliver so nervous? He doesn&#39;t even like Mrs. Windsor.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the main building, Henry and the others were preparing to leave. Oliver ran into them at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze quickly swept through the room. Still no sign of Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Natalie?&#34; Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re asking us where your wife is? How absurd!&#34; Henry snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Oliver, Adrian wanted to say something but held himself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you all going?&#34; Oliver noticed that they were all dressed up and ready to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria has a fever after her surgery, so we are going to the hospital,&#34; Edwin said gently. Henry shot him a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you not to go, didn&#39;t I?&#34; Oliver sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, just because your mother is dead, you want me to lose my mom too?&#34; After reining his resentment toward Oliver all day, Adrian finally lost control of his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I really wanted to kill her, she would&#39;ve been dead, not lying in a hospital.&#34; Oliver reached into his pocket, realizing that he had left his phone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked upstairs, he said, &#34;Victoria humiliated my mother and planned to remove her from the family cemetery. What if this news reaches the Norton family? Someone will be worried for their lives. But not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry and Adrian&#39;s faces turned pale and they suddenly lost the urge to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Norton family had helped the Windsor family in the past, and their status was even higher than that of the Windsor family worldwide. When Henry had illegitimate children, Hillary Norton hid the news from her family to save Henry. But Hillary was dead. Victoria, one of the illegitimate children, dared to insult her. If the Norton family found out about it, they would be furious and come after the Windsor family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey clenched her teeth in frustration. Oliver had once again made the Windsors obey him. Every time she saw him overpowering Adrian, she had a great sense of loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all your fault! You shouldn&#39;t suggest us to visit Victoria.&#34; Henry berated Edwin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin, always the mild one, nodded and apologized, concealing the scheming gleam behind his glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver unlocked his phone and saw three missed calls and several text messages:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mr. Oliver, where are you? I think I&#39;m lost...]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mr. Oliver, please answer the phone. There are snakes in this forest!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mr. Oliver, if you...]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last message was sent before she could finish typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t save Natalie&#39;s number, but judging from the content, the messages were clearly from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called the number. But her phone was turned off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fixed on the words &#34;Snake&#34; and &#34;Forest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, you&#39;re a Windsor. I dare you not to ask for the Nortons&#39; help in the future!&#34; Henry shouted as Oliver came downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t even spare him a glance and briskly walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, stop right there! Do you still see me as a father!&#34; Henry exclaimed furiously. Oliver had humiliated him repeatedly. And this time he had done it in front of Adrian and Hailey. Henry was infuriated and gasping for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver slowed down and said wryly, &#34;You know the answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...brat!&#34; Unfortunately, there was nothing Henry could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Henry, I&#39;ll follow him,&#34; Adrian said and quickly caught up with Oliver. He assumed Oliver was out to look for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian!&#34; Hailey shouted, stomping her feet in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey thought, &#39;I knew it. He still cares about that whore!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir Windsor, I&#39;m worried about Adrian. I want to go check on him,&#34; Hailey said to Henry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry waved his hand, gesturing for her to leave. He didn&#39;t have time to deal with her at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin quietly watched the event, a faint smile creeping on the corner of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a silent night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the surroundings were desolate, with only the sound of their own breathing and footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was familiar with the Windsor&#39;s mansion. Around the main building, the only desert area was the forest on the west side, and it was occupied by snakes and rodents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, can you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking through the wild weeds and flourishing shrubs, Oliver held a flashlight and waved it around to look for any trace of Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Charles quickly summoned the servants to come over and started searching too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help! Help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the distance, Oliver heard a woman scream among the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the voice, Oliver walked as fast as he could. Soon, with the light of the flashlight, he saw a woman with her legs entangled by a python.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Natalie!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been carefully avoiding this python. To her surprise, she still got its attention while running into other small venomous snakes and rodents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran for her life. But it was too dark in the forest, she couldn&#39;t see anything and ended up falling to the ground. The python took the opportunity to wrap around her legs, its disgusting slime seeping through her thin pants and onto her skin. Natalie nearly threw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if the python was confident that its prey couldn&#39;t escape its deadly grip, it hissed at Natalie leisurely, its head turning left and right, seemingly considering where to bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the python suddenly opened its mouth, revealing sharp fangs, and lunged at her head...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Terrified, Natalie covered her head with her hands and screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, there was a gunshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt hot liquid splashed on her, and the smell of blood filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tight grip on her legs gradually loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t feel the intense pain she had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, she opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could fully open her eyes, someone covered her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smelled the familiar scent of eucalyptus leaves and Oliver&#39;s unique scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver?&#34; she spoke, voice trembling and filled with fear, bordering on crying. &#34;I-is it you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s familiar voice was as low and indifferent as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at that moment, it brought Natalie an unprecedented sense of security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I was going to die here today!&#34; She couldn&#39;t die as she had Lucas to think about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by fear, Natalie threw herself into Oliver&#39;s arms, holding him tightly as she was worried that he would leave her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the soft body against him, Oliver froze for a moment. He had sensed her fear and dependence on him as her hot tears rapidly soaked his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart skipped a beat, yet he couldn&#39;t pinpoint the feeling he was having.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt her body was elevated as Oliver picked her up bridal style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie only felt she was alive again when she was certain that she was far away from the snake&#39;s corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People usually broke down after experiencing a horrid event. Remembering that Oliver was the cause of all the terrifying experiences she had endured, Natalie finally snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, put me down. I don&#39;t want you to hold me!&#34; Natalie struggled to get down, hitting him with clenched fists. &#34;How could you?! I know you hate me. But you can just break up with me! You have no right to torment me!&#34;</p>
