                <p>Victoria was quite satisfied with Hailey as she was the only girl Adrian had brought home. She asked, &#34;Why is she mad at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, Natalie and I are actually half-sisters,&#34; Hailey said in a gentle tone, lowering her head. &#34;She used to be into Adrian before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half-sisters?&#34; Victoria sneered, pondering over these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, she&#39;s a bastard daughter! I can&#39;t believe a lowlife like her has the audacity to like Adrian. Thankfully, Adrian didn&#39;t fall for your debauched tricks!&#34; Victoria exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was well-known in the high society circles of the Paykston as the legitimate daughter of the Watson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironically, as she insulted Natalie, Victoria completely forgot that she herself was also a bastard daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry didn&#39;t like Oliver. And Oliver marrying a bastard daughter was a disgrace to the Windsor family&#39;s name, making it more unacceptable for Henry. If the marriage wasn&#39;t Marjorie&#39;s idea, he would have thrown Natalie out immediately!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin didn&#39;t say anything, but his disdain and mockery were evident in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, have you forgotten? One of us had to marry Oliver. If it wasn&#39;t me, then you&#39;d be his bride,&#34; Natalie said, knowing that Hailey had intentionally embarrassed her. So, she wouldn&#39;t feel sorry for retorting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s words captured everyone&#39;s attention, and all eyes fixed on Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the Windsor family and the Watson family made the marriage arrangement, it wasn&#39;t specified which daughter of the Watson family was to marry the legitimate son of the Windsor family. However, logically speaking, it should be the legitimate daughter of the Watson family, not the bastard daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey hesitated for a moment but quickly devised an excuse to defend herself. She remarked, &#34;Natalie, it was your decision to marry Oliver. Are you regretting it just because you discovered he&#39;s not as good as Adrian? But you&#39;re already his wife, so you can&#39;t have second thoughts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Windsors&#39; expressions instantly changed as they glared at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A typical bastard daughter. Cunning and calculating!&#34; Victoria looked at Natalie like scum. &#34;Listen, you&#39;re not good enough for Adrian! Not ever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few minutes, Natalie became the target of blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey subtly curled her lips when people weren&#39;t watching and thought, &#39;Natalie, how naïve of you that you think you can win against me!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, I have never said that I regretted marrying Oliver. He&#39;s a good husband. I&#39;m not like you. Please don&#39;t put words in my mouth,&#34; Natalie retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Oliver had a bad temper, he was still better than Adrian, who was a total hypocrite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play coy!&#34; Victoria snapped at Natalie as she still believed that Natalie liked Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry&#39;s gaze shifted from Natalie to Adrian and Hailey, and he said, &#34;Stop arguing. She seems to be a good match for Oliver, which suits us well, as Hailey and Adrian are in love with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s smile widened as she heard Henry&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone entered the dining hall and took their seats in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Oliver&#39;s wife, Natalie should have had a better seat, but she was assigned the worst seat. Throughout the meal, they froze Natalie out as if she was an outsider. While everyone else chatted and laughed, Natalie sat alone at the end of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, eat this. It&#39;s your favorite!&#34; Hailey used her fork to serve Adrian dishes, her voice gentle and sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at these two lovebirds, Dad!&#34; Victoria smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gracefully chimed in, &#34;Adrian and Hailey are a perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undoubtedly, Edwin said it as a snide remark against Natalie too as she had been told that she wasn&#39;t good enough for Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And their approval of Hailey marrying Adrian once again showed how little they valued Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was the legitimate son and Adrian wasn&#39;t even a Windsor. Still, they deemed Adrian deserved a better wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suddenly realized that perhaps that wedding was not only embarrassing for her but also for Oliver within the Windsor family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she observed the Windsors, a sense of sadness and sympathy unexpectedly welled up in her heart—Oliver had grown up in such a toxic environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one noticed that Charles had quietly left the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the Windsor&#39;s mansion, a black and imposing Maybach was parked in a dark corner. The guards turned a blind eye and did not inform anyone inside the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles reported to the man inside the Maybach about what had happened inside the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She managed to keep calm and even said I was a good husband?&#34; Surprised, Oliver raised an eyebrow, his hand caressing a delicate silver mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie was with him, she was as harmless as a pussy cat. However, it seemed that she wasn&#39;t a pushover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, there&#39;s one more thing,&#34; Charles frowned briefly before returning to his usual stony expression. &#34;The Watson family has another daughter. She may be the one who was supposed to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he had Oliver&#39;s attention, Charles continued, &#34;Her name is Hailey. She is the legitimate daughter of Robert and his current wife. And she&#39;s dating Adrian now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s lips curled up slightly, and an icy cold mask appeared on his extraordinarily handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out everything about this within an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver got out of the car, his every move filled with swagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked toward the mansion, he put on his silver mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards showed no surprise as they saw Oliver&#39;s unharmed face and all respectfully saluted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff of the Windsor&#39;s mansion had long been replaced by Oliver&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was warmly welcomed by everyone in the Windsor family while Natelie got the cold shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t mind. After the meal, she strolled around the garden to burn the calories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She first heard the shout of her name behind her then the hurried footsteps. Adrian was fast approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew it was him without looking. He had been stealing glances at her during the meal, causing Hailey to shoot daggers at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to avoid him, Natalie furrowed her brows and quickened her pace. But it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian stopped her by grabbing her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you tried so hard to please him! What has he done? He sent you here by yourself! He wasn&#39;t there for you when you were mocked and insulted. Natalie, you brought this to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian&#39;s eyes were blazing with anger, and his handsome face twisted in a rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at his face and started to think it was getting ugly as she&#39;d seen his hideous soul underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a troublemaker!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian.&#34; Natalie&#39;s cold gaze was filled with mockery. &#34;Hailey is greatly beloved in the Watson family. She gets whatever she wants. Have you ever thought about why I could steal her fiancé so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, everyone but you have the right to blame me. When I needed you the most, you were busy with Hailey. You told me that you must take responsibility for her!&#34;</p>
