                <p>&#34;So, this dish is delicious?&#34; Isaac eagerly reached out to grab the beef, but Oliver pushed him away so fast that he couldn&#39;t even react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Buy it yourself if you want to eat,&#34; Oliver warned him with his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you buy this?&#34; Isaac couldn&#39;t recall a place that offered such delicacies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You should know that brother is very picky when it comes to food. Anything he thinks is tasty must be heavenly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie made it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Natalie made it...&#34; Isaac paused halfway through his words, remembering something. &#34;Natalie is so virtuous! Wow, she&#39;s a great wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s cold gaze swept over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, brother, I swear on my life, I have no ill intentions towards your wife!&#34; Isaac raised four fingers and swore, &#34;Friends&#39; wives should not be deceived. I know better now. I was just bluffing before... you shouldn&#39;t mind me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt broke off one of his extra fingers and exposed him, &#34;You&#39;re just scared of death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac really wanted to kick Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But gossip was still important, &#34;Brother, I&#39;ve always wanted to ask you, when your wife found out that the rumors about you weren&#39;t true, but instead you&#39;re a handsome guy with high appearance, good physical strength, and a well-endowed lower body, were you very excited?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver thought about Natalie&#39;s reaction and looked even more coldly at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be... things didn&#39;t go well last night? Isaac wondered, it shouldn&#39;t be, Brother is very capable of learning!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, when it comes to that kind of thing, men are naturally talented!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, look at this lamb and black bean soup, it warms the throat, strengthens the waist, and tones the kidney. My sister-in-law takes care of your body so well, she must really love you,&#34; Isaac comforted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, let me advise you, stop pushing the boundaries of stupidity.&#34; Wyatt glanced at Isaac and his face almost said: How the hell did I end up with such a dumbass brother?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s really incomprehensible how this dumbass is able to manage a company without going bankrupt and can even attract a bunch of girls!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...&#34; Isaac finally realized that his brother&#39;s gaze was off, &#34;Brother, the food is getting cold, eat up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention her in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do you like her? Oliver scoffed and sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s all for the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vain woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Isaac touched his nose, &#34;I originally came to show you the car modelling clothes for Natalie, let&#39;s forget about them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...Come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had only taken a few steps outside of the office when he was called back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had an expressionless face, &#34;Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt maintained a composed demeanor, but couldn&#39;t help but glance at Oliver for a moment, seeing him like this for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac smirked and immediately turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his phone and swiped to show a picture, &#34;Just this one!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had it specially designed by a designer from A Pavilion, for Natalie only!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, the car model clothes at B Pavilion were either designed by ordinary designers or bought ready-made. Only the top models at A Pavilion had the qualifications to invite renowned designers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The picture showed a set of all-black attire; black tight leather shorts, a black leather crop top with an exposed midriff and back, and a black embroidered gauze on top. The embroidery combined the coldness and hardness of black leather, making it undoubtedly stylish and alluring on a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just by looking at the design, Oliver could imagine how it would look on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared for a while and said, enunciating each word, &#34;Change it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? I think it looks great! The clothes are already done and will be delivered tomorrow,&#34; Isaac became more satisfied the more he looked, this outfit would definitely complement Natalie’s figure!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Change it!&#34; Oliver summarized in one word, too lazy to waste his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; Isaac pouted, &#34;What should I change it to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver opened the clothing inventory pictures of RK Media, the company, which included some high-end dresses for actors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one.&#34; His finger paused on a white flowing long dress with a half-shoulder tulle design and a ruffled waist, elegant and refined, suitable for any occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was completely different from a car model outfit; it looked more like something worn to a party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was at a loss for words but eventually said, &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie has a younger brother, look him up,&#34; Oliver said to Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt was in charge of RK Group&#39;s IT and AI sectors, and was also a top-notch hacker globally, so it would only take him a few minutes to get someone&#39;s information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Lucas&#39; information, Wyatt had already found out when he was investigating Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, Natalie has a younger half-brother named Lucas, 16 years old. He was diagnosed with leukemia six months ago and is currently in the hospital,&#34; Wyatt said, &#34;But Lucas has never been doted on by Robert and has always been taken care of by Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How severe is his condition? Is it fatal?&#34; Oliver gritted his teeth a little, feeling more and more upset about Natalie having a younger brother that had relied on her since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt hesitated for a moment and thought, brother, if Sister-in-Law hears you say this, be prepared to face her wrath in the future!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas is currently undergoing chemotherapy. As for his prognosis...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The situation is still stable,&#34; Wyatt said, pulling out a photo from his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a picture of Natalie and Lucas. The young boy had delicate features and was already a handsome young man. In his left hand, he held a national gold medal for a painting competition, while in his right hand, he displayed a global gold certificate for a math Olympiad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hanging around his neck was a national gold medal for a robotics competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Natalie&#39;s smile was filled with pride and tenderness, her eyes shining like stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a Natalie that Oliver had never seen before, radiant and dazzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wyatt, what&#39;s the deal with brother and Natalie?&#34; Isaac asked Wyatt. &#34;I specially hired a designer for my sister-in-law, but he wasn&#39;t satisfied and chose that other dress. Seriously, that white dress won’t help promote the sales.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The dress you picked was too revealing,&#34; Wyatt looked at him as if he were an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Revealing?&#34; Isaac couldn&#39;t agree. &#34;Didn&#39;t it come with an extra layer of sheer fabric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which do you think is more appealing, not wearing any clothes or wearing lingerie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it&#39;s lingerie!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac suddenly realized, putting his arm around Wyatt. &#34;Wow, I can&#39;t believe someone like you, who&#39;s never been in a relationship, understands this so well!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an issue of intelligence,&#34; Wyatt said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, personal attacks are uncalled for!&#34; Isaac pretended to be angry, but it lasted only a second. &#34;So, Oliver likes Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would I know? I can&#39;t read Oliver&#39;s mind. If you&#39;re interested, go ask him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re basically telling me to go die, aren&#39;t you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re always seeking death anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be so offensive, Wyatt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Natalie felt afraid of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood at the door of Oliver&#39;s room, hesitating to go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spacious room with a Gothic decoration felt like a giant beast waiting for her.</p>
