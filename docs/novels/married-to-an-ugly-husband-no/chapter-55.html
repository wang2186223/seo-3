                <p>Natalie shook her head, her eyes filled with tears of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m unwilling, then you&#39;re an adulterer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver grew impatient and grabbed Natalie&#39;s wrist, pulling her upstairs. When she resisted and struggled, he lifted her up with one hand and marched forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver! Oliver! I&#39;m sorry, don&#39;t do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be devoted to you from now on. Please, don&#39;t do this, I beg you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his determination, Natalie screamed and hit him, trying to kick him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t like him. She couldn&#39;t give herself to a man like him, even if he was her nominal husband. That psychological barrier couldn&#39;t be crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being married for so long, she had already accepted that he didn&#39;t like her and wouldn&#39;t touch her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver heard the woman&#39;s sobbing, and for the first time, he heard someone call his name in such a helpless and... tender way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stubborn heart softened inexplicably, and he paused, &#34;Devoted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing hope, Natalie placed her hands on his shoulders, struggling to lift her head and look at him. The tips of her fingers were filled with the touch of his strong muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! I promise that from now on, I will be devoted to you as my husband and take good care of you. I will be good to you! As long as you... don&#39;t force me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver&#39;s cold and determined face, full of hope and prayers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her deer-like eyes and one fell down as she spoke, as if she had been greatly wronged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Oliver was proud, he wouldn&#39;t force a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had indeed... lost control just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver put her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt dizzy for a moment and instinctively grabbed onto his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s gaze paused for a moment on those fair and slender fingers, and the irritability and fierceness remained. He wanted to smoke, but he didn&#39;t have any cigarettes with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, don&#39;t you like Adrian? Is your devotion really so cheap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t like him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wiped away her tears with the back of her hand. Why did this jerk keep saying that she liked that scumbag, Adrian!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Natalie bit her lip, her black and white eyes looked at him, but she couldn&#39;t say the word &#34;like&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered, his gaze falling on Natalie&#39;s lips, &#34;Do you want a kiss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she struggled just now, she bit her own lip, and now it was reddened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; His topic changed too quickly, and Natalie didn&#39;t react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Adrian ever kissed you?&#34; Oliver&#39;s thumb lightly brushed against the corner of her lips; his eyes filled with cold indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blinked, &#34;A peck on the cheek, does that count?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kiss on the cheek...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s hostility dissipated considerably by her innocent reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kissing is called a kiss,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No,&#34; Natalie blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only been dating Adrian for two months, and she was slow and conservative. They had only hugged and held hands; at most he had stolen a kiss on her cheek when she least expected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smirked satisfactorily and commanded, &#34;Kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie widened her eyes in shock, and once she realized she hadn&#39;t misheard, her cheeks turned even redder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver silently looked at her, and his silence exerted immense pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a married couple, he promised not to force her... a simple kiss wasn&#39;t too much to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath, made up her mind, tiptoed, closed her eyes, and quickly kissed Oliver on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too embarrassed to look at him, her clear eyes didn&#39;t know where to turn. &#34;Mr. Windsor, if there&#39;s nothing else, I&#39;ll go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he didn&#39;t say anything, Natalie hurriedly escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt only a soft, almost fleeting touch on his lips before it disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wholeheartedly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only this word could restrain Oliver&#39;s violent impulses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a few steps thinking she had narrowly escaped a predicament. Just as she was about to relax, she felt a force behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her surroundings spun, and her body was pressed against a tall carved pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s flawless handsome face enlarged in front of her, and his light-colored eyes surged with intense emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliv... Mph!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hadn&#39;t finished speaking when the man leaned down and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cold and temperamental, except for those lips...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in shock and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to push him away but didn&#39;t dare, and she couldn&#39;t push him away either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver kept his eyes open, capturing Natalie&#39;s every move. She resembled a pure and innocent fawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s rationality resurfaced, and she struggled hard, but at this point, she had no strength left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she was severely lacking oxygen and her lungs began to ache that the man released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s strong arms embraced her soft body as he watched her gasping for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showing rare patience, he said, &#34;So... do you understand now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, Adrian and Ms. Hailey Watson are getting engaged,&#34; Liam informed Oliver as he entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver responded with a grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, regarding Ms. Hailey Watson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know?&#34; Oliver looked at Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Liam respectfully replied, &#34;Mrs. Windsor also knows that your original fiancée was supposed to be Ms. Hailey Watson. She was the one who told me this information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandma didn&#39;t object?&#34; Oliver raised an eyebrow in surprise. Emma may not be very conservative, but she didn&#39;t seem like someone who would accept a daughter born out of wedlock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor thinks highly of Ms. Natalie Watson.&#34; Liam did not tell Oliver that Emma had already guessed that the Watson family would not let Hailey marry into their family. She had been observing Natalie and Hailey, the two sisters, for several years and felt that Hailey&#39;s hypocritical nature was not worthy of the young master.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not interested in Hailey.&#34; Oliver picked up on their previous conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam sighed with relief, &#34;Ms. Natalie Watson is quite lovely. The first time you met her after getting married, she even asked me if the master bedroom really belonged to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was briefly taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really was naive!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nightfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she closed her eyes, Oliver&#39;s handsome face appeared as if it were right in front of her, his incredibly sexy thin lips, and his domineering words...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had also seen his actions, which were astonishingly provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone suddenly vibrated.</p>
