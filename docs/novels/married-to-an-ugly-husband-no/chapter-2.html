                <p>Startled, Isaac hastily waved his hands. &#34;What the heck are you talking about? No, man! Oliver, she&#39;s your wife! You may not believe it, but I do have boundaries!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver lit a cigar and looked at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Natalie looked somber, but she still stood out, as beautiful as an angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most men would fall for her at first sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Oliver was an exception. He seemed to find her quite displeasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was the third offspring of the Windsor family, twenty-five years old. He was supposed to become the head of the Windsor family, commanding a vast business empire. However, ten years ago, someone plotted against him and spread rumors that he was infirm, gradually undermining his power within the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care, though, for he had his own power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being conspired at the age of fifteen, Oliver began secretly cultivating his influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just ten years, the RisingKing Group founded by him had developed rapidly and become one of the top three super-large enterprises in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, one of Oliver&#39;s subordinates, was in charge of the entertainment division of the RisingKing Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver never appeared in public. So, the outside world didn&#39;t know that he was the CEO of the RisingKing Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the Windsors had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, no one would associate the mysterious CEO of the RisingKing Group with a rumored ugly and sickly recluse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Oliver didn&#39;t wanna get married, yet he was cornered by his grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her sake, he had to marry the Watson family&#39;s daughter, as it was what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What bugged him most was that except for forcing him to get married, his grandma also wanted a great-grandkid within a year!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he thought of that, he always felt speechless. He thought, &#39;I can deal with marrying a woman I don&#39;t love. But to have a baby with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No fucking way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know Natalie has been sent by Grandma to seduce me and to have a baby with me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;That&#39;s why I resent Natalie so much that I didn&#39;t even go to the wedding.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He said, &#34;Turn off the live stream. I don&#39;t wanna watch anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did as he said and asked curiously, &#34;Oliver, if you hate her so much, why did you marry her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As far as I know, she&#39;s the Watson family&#39;s illegitimate daughter as well as the ex-girlfriend of Adrian, that idiot nephew of yours. You&#39;ll be laughed at if you&#39;ve married her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver said nothing. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, looking very troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Oliver so distressed, Isaac signaled to one of the sexy women next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding his cue, she stood up, revealing her slender, fair legs, and walked towards Oliver, wriggling her sexy booty seductively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to Oliver and whispered in a sultry voice, &#34;Handsome, need me to relax you? You know, I can do whatever you want, including a blowjob or whatever...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Oliver glared at her and said sternly, &#34;Piss off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frightened, she stumbled to the floor, not daring to come any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s aura was overwhelmingly intimidating, and she feared that if she came one step closer to him, he would clutch her neck and throw her out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing the whole thing, another man, who had been silent all this time, smiled, &#34;Isaac, you don&#39;t know anything about Oliver, do you? Unlike you, he has never messed around with women, much less have casual sex with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was Wyatt Shaw, a close friend of both Oliver and Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt was handsome, too, but in a more refined manner compared to Oliver&#39;s stark fierceness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rolled his eyes at Wyatt and said, &#34;Wyatt, you&#39;re still a virgin. What the heck do you know? Sex is the best thing in the world. Once you experience it, you&#39;ll be hooked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt retorted, “ You know, if you keep sleeping around with random women, you&#39;re gonna get an STD sooner or later.&#34;</p>
