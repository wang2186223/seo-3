                <p>&#34;As for the reason I slapped your sister, she disrespected Jane. The Harrington family is a prestigious family after all. If word of your sister’s terrible behavior gets out, I’m sure that only the Harrington will be embarrassed, not us,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane looked at Adrian and chimed in with a smile, “Adrian, don’t you think you’re crossing the line a little? Natalie has no relationship whatever with you now. Noah is your sister, not hers.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian’s expression soured immediately when Jane reminded him that Natalie was no longer his girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Hailey quickly added fuel to the fire, saying, “Adrian, look at Noah’s face…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian’s expression turned icy as he said, “Miss Watson, you refused to apologize after assaulting my younger sister, so I have no choice but to involve the police!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Since Natalie refuses to back then, she can’t blame me for being rude…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tsk, tsk, involving the police just because of a slap. No wonder the police in Paykston are you so busy!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Issac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac walked in at this moment with his hands in his pockets. He was accompanied by a blond-and-blue-eyed man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees of RK Media quickly stood up to greet Isaac, afraid that he would reprimand them for not doing anything. Fortunately, it did not seem like he was going to reprimand them at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isaac, no matter what, Natalie used violence against my sister,” Adrian said. However, he was rather polite to Isaac. After all, RK Group was a multinational corporation that was even more powerful than the Windsor Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Noah looked at Isaac with a pitiful expression as she moved her face closer to Isaac so he could have a look, saying, “Isaac, look at my face. It hurts so much.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took a step back. He had no interest in looking at Noah’s swollen face. Then, he smiled and Adrian and said, “Adrian, Natalie is our main model today. She plays an important role in the car exhibition today. I hope that you’ll at least wait until the end of the exhibition before you do anything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, Isaac added, “However, to be honest, as a man, don’t you think it’s inappropriate for you to get involved in matters between women?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, what Isaac meant was that Adrian should let this matter go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian gritted his teeth as he recalled the scene after the audition. He remembered how intimate Natalie had been with that ‘Mr. Windsor’. ‘Mr. Windsor’ clearly had a good relationship with Isaac, and Isaac was clearly speaking up for Natalie now for Mr. Windsor’s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not wait for Adrian’s response. Instead, he looked at the man behind him and said, “Arvin, please help Natalie with her styling.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, one of the models exclaimed, “Arvin?! He’s the chief beauty stylist for RK Media!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin was an internationally renowned beauty stylist. In the past, not all of the international models at Scene A had Arvin to style them. Unexpectedly, he came to style Natalie today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at Natalie, and their eyes were filled with envy, jealousy, shock, and various other emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey, in particular, was consumed by jealousy. At the same time, she felt that inviting Vivian here now was like a joke. She clenched her hands tightly, trying to control her emotions as she asked, “Isaac, I thought Arvin only works for international stars of RK Media?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of Isaac, Arvin replied, “Under normal circumstances, yes. However, today is an exception.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin did not seem dissatisfied that he was assigned to work with an unknown model like Natalie. Instead, he looked at Natalie’s face and gushed, “Wow! Your face is spectacular! I really like you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Isaac reminded Arvin in a low voice, &#34;Are you trying to get yourself killed by saying such words?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oops!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin covered his mouth in an exaggerated manner as he looked around nervously, as though he was worried that someone was watching him. Then, he gestured to Natalie and said politely, “Natalie, please take a seat here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Isaac, puzzled. She had naturally heard of Arvin, and she knew how influential the other party was in the fashion industry. Ten Vivians could not even compare to half an Arvin. She could not figure out why Arvin was assigned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not explain and only instructed the person in charge to continue with getting the models ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Natalie did not ask any further and only thanked Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re welcome,” Isaac said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not cross Natalie’s mind at all that this matter was related to Oliver, let alone the fact that Oliver was the one who sent Arvin to her. After all, she only knew that Isaac was in charge of RK Media. If it was not Isaac, who else could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Noah was crying, pleading with Adrian to avenge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian had already been in a bad mood since Isaac arrived, and he grew even more annoyed with Noah’s pestering. He said impatiently, “Enough! Just drop this matter, and don’t bring it up again!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah was in disbelief. She could not believe that her brother, who usually spoiled her, would refuse to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll have the driver send you home,” Adrian said. He did not have any patience left for Noah at this moment; his mind was filled with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, after learning that Natalie obtained the position of the main model, Adrian deliberately hired Vivian for Hailey. It was partly for Hailey, but mostly, it was to provoke Natalie. He hoped to see her jealous and regretful. Unexpectedly, Isaac invited Arvin, who was far superior to Vivian. This was like a slap to his face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, Adrian had a feeling that it was Isaac’s idea to invite Arvin. It felt like it had something to do with that ‘Mr. Windsor’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Noah, who was extremely vain, also had no intention of staying here with a swollen face. She glared at Natalie and Jane fiercely for a moment before she left in a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was seething with anger, but there was nothing she could do to vent her anger. She was accustomed to using others to do her dirty deeds while she maintained a gentle and virtuous image. Now that she had lost her pawn, Noah, she was helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, order finally returned to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin styled Natalie while Vivian styled Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the others, they had to wait in line for the ten beauty stylists who had been hired by the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane sat at the side and observed Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, while Arvin did Natalie’s hair, he said, “Natalie, I have to say, among the girls I’ve worked with, you have the best skin!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin was not arrogant and bad-tempered like the rumors said. Instead, Natalie found him to be very friendly, just like Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to thank Arvin, he said something that caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have very nice lips as well. I bet it’ll feel great to kiss you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from shock, a hint of vigilance could be seen on Natalie’s face as she looked at Arvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arvin seemed to realize his mistake and quickly corrected himself, “No, don’t get me wrong. I meant to say that your husband must be very lucky!”</p>
