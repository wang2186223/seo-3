                <p>The celebration dinner was held in a hall on the first floor while the VIP room was located on the second floor, which was the entertainment area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loud music rang in the luxurious private room, and a few people could be seen dancing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing Oliver and Isaac’s return, everyone in the room stood up, showing great respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Windsor, Isaac, you’re back!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a young blond man noticed Natalie standing behind Oliver, and his eyes lit up. He said excitedly, “Oh, you brought a beautiful woman back with you! A new acquisition?“</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac picked up a small pillow nearby and threw it at the young man, “If you don’t want to die, shut up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie felt a touch on her shoulder before she was pulled into Oliver’s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so you’re Windsor’s woman! I misspoke earlier. I’ll punish myself with a drink,” the young blond man said knowingly before he promptly downed a glass of whisky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, the other men and women in the room also sized Natalie up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men thought that Natalie was stunning, but they did not have any extra thoughts. After all, they knew she was with someone they could not afford to provoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women, on the other hand, felt a hint of jealousy, unhappy that Natalie had everyone’s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pursed her lips. Considering how aloof Oliver was, she did not expect him to come to places like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the wealthy young men in the room resumed their games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, do you want to play a game?” Isaac asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not like nor dislike this kind of gathering. Everything depended on his mood. At this time, he nodded in response to Isaac’s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie found a corner to sit in and sighed. She did not understand why he brought her here instead of letting her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not counting Natalie, most of the women here were familiar with each other. They intentionally excluded her as they surrounded the wealthy young men, serving them drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie brought her phone out and checked the calendar, calculating the time. Lucas would complete his round of chemotherapy in two days, and she planned to visit him at the hospital at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, a wave of cheers erupted in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Windsor, you have to kiss someone! You can’t back out of this!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Cadence, Windsor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the young men pointed at a woman, who was clearly different from the other women. She sat with the young men like their peers, instead of serving them and flattering them like the other women. She wore a short Gucci leather skirt that revealed her legs. Even in the dim lights, one could vaguely see her exquisite and distinct features. She was undoubtedly a delicate beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence Aura glanced at Oliver shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although those present did not know Oliver’s identity and background, they knew that Cadence had her sights set on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Aura family was a prestigious family in Paykston, on par with the Harrington family. With such a background, it was naturally not difficult for her to mingle with this group of young men as a peer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, no one expected anything from Oliver. In the past, he had always refused to engage in sort of ambiguous activities and would prefer to solve matters by drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not spare Cadence a glance at all. He looked at the card in his hand. On the card were the words: Kiss any member of the opposite sex for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suddenly heard someone call her name. When she looked up, she saw everyone looking at her. Among them, Oliver beckoned her with his hand. She had a bad feeling about this, but she still went over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s the matter, Wind…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s words were interrupted, and she let out a cry of surprise as she was pulled into Oliver’s warm embrace. She instinctively placed one of her hands on his chest while the other rested on his waist. When she looked up, he saw his face approaching her. At this moment, she finally recalled someone telling Oliver that he had to kiss someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘H-he… Is he going to kiss me?!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s mind went blank, but her hand reacted faster than her brain as she reached out to cover Oliver’s lips, which were only inches away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone fell silent immediately. Even the few people who were singing and rapping along to the song fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac covered his face with his hand, pretending like he had not just witnessed this incredibly awkward scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young men looked at each other, and all of them could tell that they were thinking the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Did my eyes trick me? Did Windsor finally agree to kiss someone but was rejected?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression darkened immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘As expected, she doesn’t like me and finds me repulsive.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was very close to him, and she could clearly feel the tension in his arms that were supporting her body. He seemed like he was about to lose his temper, and the pressure around him was extremely low. She quickly thought about what she had done to upset him. When realization dawned on her, she trembled slightly. She could feel his soft lips pressed against her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although this was not the first time Natalie had covered Oliver’s mouth, the situation now was completely different. Her action had undoubtedly embarrassed Oliver in front of everyone. She had made a fool out of him. Her hand stiffened, and after a moment, she tremblingly withdrew her hand. She could not meet his eyes at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not even need to ask to know that she was unwilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, Oliver downed a glass of whisky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie stood up, he had already placed the glass on the table. Then, she saw him downing another glass of whisky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The punishment for failing the challenge on the card was to down five glasses of whisky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You b*tch, you should be honored that Windsor even wanted to kiss you,” Cadence said, completely regarding Natalie as her rival, “Didn’t you hear him tell you to get lost? What are you still doing here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence naturally could not wait to drive Natalie away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Windsor, I’ll take my leave first,” Natalie said, ignoring Cadence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Oliver drank another glass of whisky. She knew that he was furious now, so she decided against advising him to drink less, knowing that it would only further infuriate him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, the young blond man from earlier said, “Don’t be angry, Windsor. It’s not worth it to be angry over a woman. Look, isn’t Cadence good? That woman may be pretty, but she’s nothing special. You’re better off…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his words, Isaac threw a pack of cigarettes at him and said, “Barrett, you’re your mouth!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, in Wyatt’s words, Isaac muttered inwardly, ‘This fool. His words are going to get him killed!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrett finally noticed Oliver’s murderous gaze, and he no longer dared to talk. He also knew that Isaac had just saved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver finally looked up, there was no sign of Natalie in the private room. He stood up and turned on the lights, causing everyone to cover their eyes. When he confirmed that she had really left the room, he felt a stabbing pain in his heart.</p>
