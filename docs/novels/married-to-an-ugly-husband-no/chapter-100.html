                <p>Natalie was surprised that Oliver did not take things further. She naturally had no complaints. She quickly pretended to sleep, telling herself to fall asleep quickly before he changed his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her breathing grew even and she finally fell asleep, Oliver touched his lower back and found that it was damp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up silently and brought the first aid kid into the bathroom. He looked at himself in the mirror as he re-dressed the wound and discovered that his lips were slightly swollen. At this moment, he really could not wait for his injuries to heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A total of twenty people made it to the finals of Top Avenue. The finals were divided into three rounds, which would take place at different times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although modeling competitions were not as popular as singing or dancing competitions, it was still rather popular, especially among those in the fashion industry or those with an interest in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many show directors and modeling agencies would scout for new talent during these competitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Natalie arrived backstage, she could feel many unfriendly looks being thrown her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn’t look like much to me. I can’t believe Cory Clayton said she has unlimited potential. She can’t compare to Arwyn at all.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She’s the one in the black floral dress!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Black floral dress?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked down and found that it was indeed what she was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An exquisitely gorgeous model with long and wavy golden hair and a golden tan to match sat on the couch nearby. Her long and slender legs were crossed at this moment. Her pose accentuated her perfect figure. It seemed like she was even taller than Natalie. At this moment, several other models surrounded, talking to her. Most importantly, Hailey was sitting next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey whispered provocatively into Arwyn’s ears, “Arwyn, she made quite the splash during the autumn car exhibition! Many people think that she’ll be the champion of this season’s Top Avenue.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the hype surrounding Natalie and Cory’s praise were all spread by Hailey to instigate others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arwyn, a B-list model, became famous at a young age. If it were not for a major mistake on the runway and two consecutive scandals last year, she would have already become an A-list model. There was no doubt that among the 20 finalists, she was the most famous and influential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arwyn and Hailey had known each other for over a year now. Although Arwyn’s family was also quite wealthy, they were not as wealthy as the Watsons. This was also the reason Arwyn treated Hailey, a C-list model, like an equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Owen scoffed arrogantly and asked, “You’re Natalie?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. Nice to meet you,” Natalie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arwyn stood up and approached Natalie, towering a few inches over the latter. After sizing Natalie up for a moment, she said dismissively, “With that height, you can only be a model at the local car exhibitions. You’ll have to work hard.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, Arwyn turned away. It was as though Natalie was unworthy of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey smiled at Natalie provocatively before she hurried over to Arwyn and continued chatting like they were old friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the other models sized Natalie up for a moment before they looked away. Clearly, they had decided to exclude her from the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them, Arwyn had the highest status in the industry while Hailey had the best background, thanks to her relationship with the Harrington family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the two women’s hostility toward Natalie, it was only natural for them to follow the powerful and avoid the weak. It would been more surprising if they had not singled Natalie out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In any case, Natalie was not surprised. It was not the first time that Hailey had caused her to be isolated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the camaraderie of the others, it seemed like a war had started silently as soon as the outfits were brought in. After all, this was a competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the outfits were being brought in, the group of models rushed forward and began to choose their outfits. In the end, when everything was done, the clueless Natalie was only left with a mismatched outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey, who was holding a gorgeous long feathered grown, looked at Natalie kindly and explained, “Oh, Natalie, didn’t you know? For the first round, you have to fight for the outfits you want. It’s on a first-come-first-served basis!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When an employee nearby overheard this and saw the confused expression on Natalie’s face, she said impatiently, “This change was proposed by the Watson Group yesterday. How could you not know? We’ve already informed all the models yesterday!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey ‘kindly’ explained, &#34;Perhaps no one told her because she doesn’t have an agent and doesn’t belong to any agency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Hailey was the one behind the change in the first round. How could she inform Natalie about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, you’re just a freelancer? Well, you should feel grateful that you even made it to the finals then,” the employee said with a disdainful expression on her face. In her opinion, someone like Natalie would be eliminated soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s outfit consisted of an oversized beige mink coat, a plaid skirt, and a furry hat. It was hard to tell which designer’s clothes she was wearing. From the looks of it, it seemed like she might really be eliminated soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other models’ outfits were only average, but compared to Natalie’s, they looked quite good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Arwyn walked past Natalie with her outfit in hand and smiled at her mockingly. She looked at Natalie as though she was looking at an ant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie used to admire Arwyn’s works, but now, she changed her mind completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other models were all eagerly anticipating Natalie’s performance. After all, with every elimination, their chances to win would increase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, everyone was tense, contemplating their poses to showcase their outfits. Just as everyone was about to walk out, someone exclaimed in surprise. They turned around and saw Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked powerful and noble dressed in her outfit. She wore a pair of deerskin boots. She wore her coat over the plaid skirt. Despite the incongruity, it somehow worked on her. With her dark makeup, there was a hint of wildness to her look. Even the strange fur hat did not look out of place on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Isn’t it supposed to be like a beggar’s outfit? Why does it look so good on her?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In comparison, their outfits lacked distinctive features and looked generic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Hailey felt indignant, she had already expected this. She looked at Arwyn and deliberately said, “She’s always been like this. She likes to pretend, giving people the illusion that she’s weak. However, she knows exactly what she’s doing and will deliver a blow to her opponents at the last moment.”</p>
