                <p>&#34;Vanity?&#34; Natalie exclaimed, pointing at herself in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that, in Adrian&#39;s eyes, her forced marriage to Oliver was seen as an act of vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it true?&#34; Adrian sneered. &#34;Natalie, don&#39;t deny what you did! Apologize to Hailey now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey nestled in Adrian&#39;s arms, casting a contemptuous and provocative glance at Natalie where Adrian couldn&#39;t see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t help but laugh mockingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine, then!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she knew the true face of Adrian!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a man was not worthy of her love!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, listen up, I would rather marry Oliver than marry you,&#34; Natalie picked up her bag and headed toward the door. &#34;And as for an apology, it&#39;s not going to happen! I hope you guys are happy together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian gritted his teeth, reluctantly watching Natalie walk away. Her graceful and enchanting figure was a fatal attraction to any man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t deserve Natalie! That sick and ugly bastard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Night Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the evening show, most models were non-professional. They were here to catch the eyes of wealthy sponsors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was brought to All Night Manor in the afternoon, with many young and pretty models already dressed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are your outfits for tonight&#39;s show. Don&#39;t disappoint me!&#34; Sienna tossed the clothes at her, knowing that Natalie would do as she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a three-piece glittery swimsuit with a transparent veil to partially cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Sienna left, Natalie looked around at the other models. She fixed her gaze on a beautiful woman who had a lot of work done on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was complaining about something while holding a black cocktail dress. Although the dress was designed to be tight-fitting with a large portion of the back exposed, it was still much better than the &#34;three pieces of cloth&#34; Natalie received.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, don&#39;t you like your outfit for the show?&#34; Natalie greeted, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not sexy at all. How can I get any extra attention with such a stupid dress?&#34; The woman noticed the clothes in Natalie&#39;s hand and her eyes lit up. That outfit would get everyone&#39;s attention!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she asked, &#34;Darling, how about we switch outfits?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie replied, &#34;Yeah! Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this kind of show, no one would care about the outfits of models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>RisingKing Group Headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, there&#39;s an evening show at All Night Club tonight. Wanna go and have some fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac loved to have fun and was always in the know about exciting activities, so naturally, he wouldn&#39;t miss the All Night Manor event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not interested,&#34; Oliver said without even looking up and continued his work at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are some really hot chicks this time. I saw their photos. There&#39;s one called Natalie, and she&#39;s just gorgeous! She looks both hot and innocent. Can you believe that? I bet she can easily make it into the top three of the Paykston Beauty Rankings. Guys would fight to sleep with her tonight!&#34; Isaac tried his best to persuade him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac only knew that Oliver was married, but he didn&#39;t know that Oliver&#39;s wife&#39;s name was Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver paused as he was about to sign on something. His eyes turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie? Natalie was a model, and tonight she had a late-night show. It was quite a coincidence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Oliver raised his head, his voice as cold as ice. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Night Club,The runway at the night show shimmered with blue lights, casting an incredibly decadent vibe across the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the music was on, models with ample chests and long legs graced the stage one by one. Some adorned cute bunny girl outfits, some dressed up as alluring sirens, and some flaunted sexy swimsuits, catering to the diverse tastes of men under the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the VIP private rooms on the second floor, the runway was visible through the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans, Natalie from our company is up there. Look, she&#39;s the woman in the sequined swimsuit! Later, I&#39;ll ask her to come to you.&#34; Sienna pointed to the model strutting down the stage and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian Evans was a baldy in his fifties. After he glanced at the woman on the catwalk with murky eyes, he let out a disdainful chuckle, &#34;She looks like she&#39;s done a dozen plastic surgeries. And you have the nerve to say she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in your company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna took a closer look at the woman on stage, and her expression instantly changed. &#34;Th-that&#39;s not Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When another model took the stage, Brian said lustfully, &#34;This one is not bad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s her! That&#39;s Natalie!&#34; Sienna&#39;s face turned pale with anger. She would teach that little bitch a lesson!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in room SV208.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver! Look, that&#39;s the Natalie!&#34; Isaac raised his chin toward Natalie and made a clicking noise with his tongue. &#34;So pretty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat on the couch with his legs crossed in a dominant and lazy posture. Holding a cigarette between his fingertips, his cold gaze fell upon the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing tall at 5 feet 9 inches, stood out among the women on the stage who were there to &#34;promote&#34; themselves. Her skin, smooth like porcelain, showcased her clavicles and shoulder bones like exquisite pieces of art under the lights. Dressed in a black outfit, she radiated even more brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Natalie was emotionless, concealing her usual gentleness. She looked like a completely different person. She couldn&#39;t hide the inherent elegance she possessed on the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cloaked in black, the mere sight of her stirred the blood of all men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was taken aback; he had not expected that the woman before him, who had been feigning ignorance and innocence, could also possess such an elegant and haughty demeanor.</p>
