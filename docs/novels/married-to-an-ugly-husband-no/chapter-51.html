                <p>&#34;I feel like I haven&#39;t seen you around the main building before. When do you finish work? Before you finish, let me make you some snacks. I&#39;m quite skilled at cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you like to eat?&#34; The maid&#39;s hands trembled slightly, and she kept her head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, you&#39;re too kind. Don&#39;t thank me, really.&#34; After applying the medicine, the maid quickly left the room with her belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything returned to calmness. Natalie was lost in her thoughts about Oliver. In a way, she seemed to owe Oliver another favor. Objectively speaking, apart from his unpredictable temperament and the cold-blooded manner in which he killed at the old mansion, he was actually a good person, even outstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his perfect appearance, outstanding temperament, formidable abilities, and powerful family background, if he wanted the outside world to know about these, countless high society ladies would flock to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was willing to reveal the truth about himself to the world, it would surely cause a nationwide sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, it&#39;s over.&#34; The maid reported to Oliver, who was standing outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady&#39;s injury is not severe. The swelling should go down by tomorrow.&#34; As she spoke, another maid approached and respectfully handed her a white lab coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor May, here are your clothes.&#34; Rosy May thanked her and took back her own clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Oliver had no further instructions, she turned to change out of the maid uniform. After taking a few steps, she couldn&#39;t help but glance back and, impressed, sent a text message to Wyatt: [Young Master, has Mr. Windsor fallen in love?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy was a top surgeon and also Oliver&#39;s personal doctor. He was good friends with Wyatt, as they both shared a passion for &#34;skills.&#34; One advocated for medical skills, while the other advocated for technology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: [How do you know that?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy: [Mr. Windsor asked me to pretend to be his housemaid and serve his woman. He didn&#39;t allow me to mention his kind intentions. That lady kept thanking me and even wanted to make desserts for me, which made me feel embarrassed.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt didn&#39;t reply to her text. Within half a minute, Rosy received a call from Wyatt, &#34;Dr. May, let&#39;s grab a meal and tell me what happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fool!&#34; Rosy disdainfully uttered two words and hung-up Wyatt&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back to the girl just now, she was so beautiful that it was impossible for anyone to look away. Her beauty was not just superficial, but exuded a natural charm that appeased anyone, and she had a good personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy couldn&#39;t help but wonder if it was fortunate or unfortunate for the girl to be watched by Oliver, such a radical beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the guest room wasn&#39;t closed securely, and Oliver came out of his study after finishing some paperwork. As he passed by Natalie&#39;s room, he inexplicably stopped and quietly pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon was shining brightly tonight, and in the dim moonlight, he could see the figure of a woman lying on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faintly heard some sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobbing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned, taking big steps toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had her fists clenched at her chest and her legs curled up, a self-protective posture. Her brows were tightly furrowed, and tears flowed from her closed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she have a nightmare or did she find out something heartbreaking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver finally reacted, his fingers had uncontrollably wiped away her tears. It seemed that the bruises on her cheeks and swelling had disappeared, and an inexplicable and awkward pain arose in his heart.</p>
