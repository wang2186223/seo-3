                <p>Natalie was in the middle of stretching her legs when a cold voice suddenly spoke from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she let out a scream. The voice was too close, right on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing her balance, she instinctively spun around and grabbed onto something to steady herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, she found herself tightly clutching a piece of cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was completely taken aback when Natalie suddenly grabbed his clothes. Caught off guard, he involuntarily leaned in, bringing her face inches closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he knew it, her soft lips had lightly brushed against the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s mind went completely blank. She blinked, not believing what had just happened and unsure of what she had felt against her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing what she had done, she pushed Oliver away abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I... It wasn&#39;t...&#34; Natalie&#39;s cheeks flushed with nervousness and embarrassment, rendering her speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s expression turned cold as if he were looking at a stranger. His gaze was icy, making Natalie feel like she was already dead to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the last time at All Night Manor could be considered an accident, what about this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this another accident too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had kissed Oliver first and then acted as if she was the victim, pushing him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really knew how to put on an act!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Oliver&#39;s cold expression was tinged with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step forward, causing Natalie to stumble back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her back against the railing, she had nowhere left to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O-Oliver, you startled me by speaking that I lost my balance and accidentally fell onto you. It wasn&#39;t intentional!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been deliberately showing off every morning, trying to catch my eye, haven&#39;t you?&#34; Oliver, who followed a routine of morning jogs, had noticed Natalie for two days in a row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt wrongly accused. She wasn&#39;t familiar with the surroundings and only circled the main building. How had that turned into flaunting herself in front of Oliver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly came the sound of pouring water and the thud of the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, nervous, accidentally knocked the bottle of honey water on the railing, causing the sticky liquid to splash out, and it soaked Oliver&#39;s pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his waist down to his thighs, they were all wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who was even slightly familiar with Oliver would know about his subtle obsession with cleanliness. Oliver&#39;s mood suddenly changed. &#34;Natalie, you didn&#39;t succeed at All Night, so you&#39;re trying again, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No wonder you&#39;re resorting to these damn tricks!&#39; Oliver thought to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face flushed with embarrassment once again. Even if Oliver didn&#39;t believe her, she couldn&#39;t understand how she had ended up in such a predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really hadn&#39;t done it on purpose!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was being dragged upstairs by Oliver, his expression gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his towering frame and long legs, his strides were wide and swift. Despite Natalie&#39;s own considerable height, she struggled to match his pace, stumbling along behind him in a sorry state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants exchanged knowing glances, and those with discerning eyes could tell that Natalie had once again displeased Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I swear, it was an accident!&#34; Natalie pleaded as she was dragged into the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room still oppressed her as much as it had the first time she stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take them off!&#34; Oliver demanded, his expression stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The honey water had only soaked a small area, but to him, it felt like his entire body was tainted and grimy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, please... I... I...&#34; Natalie couldn&#39;t bring herself to look at Oliver. &#34;I&#39;m on my period. I can&#39;t do that now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the crap, or you&#39;ll find yourself flying out that window!&#34; Oliver jabbed a finger toward the bedroom window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being thrown out that way wouldn&#39;t kill Natalie, but she&#39;d likely end up badly hurt or disabled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s spine turned to ice. This was Oliver&#39;s domain, and he had the power to make good on his threats. If he decided to throw her out, she could bleed to death, and no one would dare help without his say-so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she couldn&#39;t give in. She couldn&#39;t die!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas needed her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forceful exhale, Natalie&#39;s fingers quivered as she reached for her waistband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver blurted out, &#34;Natalie, are you kidding me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her resigned expression, he didn&#39;t know what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take them off!&#34; Oliver gestured to his soiled pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to reality, Natalie nodded vigorously, barely containing her relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank heavens Oliver didn&#39;t mean for her to strip herself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as this thought flickered through her mind, her relief vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take off Oliver&#39;s...pants?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hesitated, her gaze fixed on his...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you want me to take off your pants? Isn&#39;t that a bit inappropriate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; How dirty they are, but do you expect me to do it myself?&#34; Oliver looked down at Natalie with an intimidating glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I can help.&#34; Natalie reached out, her hand shaking visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play games!&#34; Oliver&#39;s sudden outburst made Natalie jolt, her hand shaking even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked up, her eyes wide with fright, so mortified that her face turned crimson. She couldn&#39;t even manage to speak up for herself. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she said, &#34;I&#39;m not playing games. You just gave me a scare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was about to muster the courage to proceed, Oliver suddenly grabbed her hand and shoved it away forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stumbled back, shooting a venomous glare at the floor, too livid to voice anything but silent curses labeling Oliver a &#34;lunatic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Oliver barked as he marched straight into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut with a resounding bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After subjecting himself to an hour-long cold shower in an attempt to regain his composure, Oliver stepped out of the bathroom, unable to resist tracing his lips with his fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, countless women had crossed his path without so much as stirring a flicker of emotion, yet Natalie had managed the impossible. She had touched a part of him that no other woman had reached before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver silently cursed, feeling incredibly frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was riddled with anxiety. In her first twenty years, she had hardly ever made any significant mistakes. However, since arriving here, she had somehow managed to thoroughly and swiftly piss off Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was in a terrible mood, and the mealtime at the villa was unbearably tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at the head of the dining table, legs crossed, Oliver glowered with cold fury and displeasure. He drummed his fingers on the table, producing a sharp sound that resonated like a war drum within his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you serve me this?&#34; he scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The antique dining table was laden with a medley of dishes, ranging from baked snails and scallops to white wine mussel soup, white sauce braised veal, fresh sashimi, and squid ink slices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A global smorgasbord of culinary delights adorned the table, with ingredients painstakingly air-shipped to guarantee their ultimate freshness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as Oliver tasted these delicacies, they all seemed tasteless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio of chefs standing vigil beside the table quivered in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all esteemed culinary masters, but having their creations dismissed as &#34;this&#34; was disheartening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having recently crossed Oliver, Natalie stood among the servants, rendered speechless. In her heart, she silently grumbled that he was truly a hard one to satisfy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Oliver&#39;s gaze fell on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nearly jumped, fearing he had caught her repulsed expression earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and prepare me a meal.&#34; After Oliver spoke, he gestured for someone to clear the dishes from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anorexia often left all food tasting bland, but the morning sopas had awakened his taste buds and satisfied his palate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said my cooking was terrible...&#34; Natalie mumbled, hands tightly clasped, feeling somewhat reluctant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Oliver looked up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like to eat?&#34; Natalie hastily plastered on a fake smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spoken so softly, yet Oliver heard her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can you cook?&#34; Oliver inquired.</p>
