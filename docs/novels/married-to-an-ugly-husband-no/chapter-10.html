                <p>Half a month ago，Her half-sister and her boyfriend who had sworn to love her forever had sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked in on them, and that actually became their excuse to ask her to marry Oliver on behalf of Hailey. Adrian claimed that he had to be responsible for Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, it hurts so much! My hand hurts! What if it scars? I&#39;m a model! I can&#39;t afford to have scars!&#34; Hailey whined, burying her face in Adrian&#39;s chest and crying pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, freshly brewed coffee wasn&#39;t that hot at all. With proper treatment, it wouldn&#39;t leave any scars. She would suffer a bit of superficial pain at most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let that happen,&#34; Adrian comforted Hailey, and then he was about to deal with the woman who had made Hailey suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the second he turned around, he was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Natalie with surprise, not at all menacing anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he had pursued Natalie passionately for almost half a year before she agreed to date him. Natalie was reserved and conservative, and during those two months they were together, they did no more than hold hands and hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hailey often flirted with Adrian, who was well aware of her intentions. Therefore, when she came to him to have drinks alone one night, they hit it off and had sex until dawn. When Natalie came home and walked in on them, they were just about to reach an orgasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, did I push you too hard? I didn&#39;t mean to. I&#39;m sorry. Are you hurt?&#34; Adrian let go of Hailey and walked towards Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Hailey was worried that Adrian still had feelings for Natalie. So, she clenched her teeth and clung to Adrian&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, aggrieved, &#34;Natalie, I know you&#39;re upset about me and Adrian being together, but ... you shouldn&#39;t have intentionally burned me with hot coffee! Besides, you&#39;re already married to Oliver. You&#39;re his wife now! Please! Just leave Adrian and me alone, OK?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harrington family was one of the most prestigious families, second only to the mysterious Windsor family. Adrian was handsome and romantic, and in Hailey&#39;s eyes, he belonged to no one but her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew him well. He was an arrogant man who liked women to be absolutely dependent on him. The last thing he could stand was disloyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she had expected, Adrian didn&#39;t feel guilty anymore. Instead, he looked at Natalie mockingly and disdainfully as if she were a cheap slut, and if he glanced at her again, he would puke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Natalie, about that night, you got me wrong. You refused to hear me out and decided to marry Oliver because of your own vanity. Given so, stop trying to get me back. I love Hailey now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While saying, he thought, &#39;I slept with Hailey once. So what? Every man has a mistress nowadays. Only women like Natalie would make a big deal out of it.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, apologize to Hailey now!&#34;</p>
