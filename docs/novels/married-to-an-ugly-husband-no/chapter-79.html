                <p>&#34;Hey, this woman has an amazing figure! Let me see what she looks like!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was so frightened by these words that she forgot to move her lips for a moment. At the same time, she could feel the subtle change of the man’s aura. Moreover, from beneath her hands, she could him tensing, ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop messing around! Hurry up and look for that guy! Otherwise, the boss will kill you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, okay!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can smell the scent of blood in the air! D definitely hasn’t gone far. Split up. Some of you search outside, and the rest will continue here. Remember, don’t alert the hospital staff!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within two seconds, the group of men left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a long sigh as her strength drained out from her body. It was her first time doing something like that, after all. She leaned against the railing to stabilize herself. Now that her nervousness was gone, her face finally turned red from embarrassment after she realized what she had done earlier. It was also at this time that she realized the man’s hair had changed from black to silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He casually tossed the black wig in his hand away, accurately throwing it into the trash can nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silver hair coupled with his cool and roguish appearance made him look even more mysterious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; he asked. His back was stained with blood, but he did not seem to feel any pain. His expression was calm, and his voice was indifferent. It did not look like he was being chased at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’ve never liked owing people. Since you helped me today, what do you want in return? Money, or perhaps, I can help you kill someone?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He assumed that she had helped her because she was attracted to him. After all, countless women had thrown themselves at him because of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘K-Kill someone?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie trembled, realizing what kind of person she had just saved. She looked at the extremely familiar face in front of him and asked, “I don’t want anything in return. I just one to know one thing. Do you know Roger Wild?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes that flashed with a hint of surprise before he said, “I’m Roger Wild.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, he left without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s Roger Wild?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie massaged her temples and thought that she must have gone crazy earlier. Even if the man in front of her resembled Roger Wild, how could she have acted so recklessly? Moreover, Roger Wild was dead. He had fallen off a cliff when they were in high school, and his body was never found. He was a gentle and bright individual who would not wield a blade against a stranger like that emotionless man did. Moreover, Roger was the same age as her while the man seemed several years older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie chided herself for her absurd behavior of risking her life to save that man merely because he resembled someone she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, where did you go?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Natalie emerged from the stairwell, Oliver hurried over. His expression was dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything else, Oliver hugged her so tightly that her bones ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around them looked at them curiously, whispering among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie tried to push him away but failed. She explained, “There are so many people watching. Let me go… I went to the bathroom after speaking to the doctor…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Natalie carefully from head to toe, feeling slightly relieved seeing that she was not injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Natalie cautiously probed, saying, &#34;I saw a group of strange men just now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They’re searching for someone. Don&#39;t get involved,&#34; Oliver said as he instinctively scanned their surroundings for suspicious people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Wyatt had sent news that the top assassin, D, was carrying out a mission at the top floor of the hospital today. He had a perfect track record, but today, he ran into some trouble. He was ambushed. After he was shot, he now being chased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His code name D, stood for death. No one knew what his real name was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver knew it was unlikely for Natalie to be involved with these people, but when he received the news, he went crazy looking for her when he could not find her, fearing that something had happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Have I really fallen for her?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded and did not say anything else. She wondered if that silver-haired man managed to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a helicopter landed on the helipad on the rooftop. The injured silver-haired man, surrounded by several men in black, boarded the helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie returned to the ward, the doctor was conducting a routine check-up on Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young boy lay obediently on the bed, appearing frail in his white outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas found out he had leukemia during a school sports event when his nose started bleeding. Not long after that, he began to bleed from his seven orifices, which was one of the symptoms of leukemia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, even after the discovery, he remained calm, facing life and death bravely unlike an ordinary 16-year-old teenager. He seemed more like an elderly person who had accepted that death was imminent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Lucas exchanged a few more words before she finally left with Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed, Lucas’s sunny expression was immediately replaced by a frosty one. He gestured to the doctor nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor asked respectfully, “Mr. Watson, is there something you need?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Investigate that man who was with my sister,” Lucas ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, that gentleman earlier didn&#39;t seem to have any ill intentions toward Miss Watson. Your condition isn&#39;t stable. I’d advise you not to worry about these things for now. I was specifically brought here from another hospital to take care of you. If something were to happen to you, those people from the organization would kill me. I&#39;m just a powerless doctor...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My first impression of that man tells me that he’s not a good person, and you tell me that he has no ill intentions?&#34; Lucas asked coldly, completely disregarding the doctor&#39;s concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s handsome, has an extraordinary temperament, and dresses well. Why does he not look like a good person?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister is more important than my pathetic body. And besides, we can&#39;t find a matching bone marrow donor for now. Go investigate!&#34; Lucas ordered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright, alright, don’t get so worked up,” the doctor said, giving in, before he muttered under his breath, “Stubborn patients are the most difficult to deal with…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas threw a pillow at the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, since you’re a key member of the organization, why don’t reveal your capability to Miss Watson?” the doctor said, quickly changing his words, driven by his strong will to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How can I do that? I have to pretend to be an ordinary person so I can act spoiled,’ Lucas thought to himself as he looked at the doctor as though he was looking at a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor inwardly sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Poor Miss Watson. She doesn’t know that she’s raised a little devil. She thinks he’s an innocent child, but she has no idea that he’s a beast in disguise…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they left the ward, Natalie asked, “Did you say something you shouldn’t have said to my brother earlier?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had noticed the unfriendly gaze Lucas had shot Oliver earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What shouldn&#39;t I have said?&#34; Oliver smiled dangerously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, Natalie finally remembered that she had introduced Oliver as her boss to Lucas. A sense of guilt washed over her immediately. After all, that introduction denied her relationship with him and his existence.</p>
