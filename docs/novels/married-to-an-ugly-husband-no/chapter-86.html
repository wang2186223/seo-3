                <p>Natalie pretended to turn around casually, looking for the person who was following her but did not see anyone suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Did I imagine it, or is the other party too good at hiding?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After experiencing a life-or-death situation last night, Natalie had become more alert. It was better to be safe than sorry, after all. She deliberately walked toward the frozen food section, hoping to use the reflective surfaces there to see if there was anyone suspicious following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she still did not see anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me. Goods coming through! Be careful!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An employee suddenly came out of the staff room, pushing out a stack of crates about two meters high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was just about to make way and move to the side when a young couple, who were playfully fighting behind her, accidentally pushed her into the middle of the aisle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crates were stacked up high, so the employee did not see Natalie, who suddenly appeared in his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened too quickly. Natalie did not have time to move. She stood frozen, looking at the crates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the critical moment, a figure rushed over, grabbing Natalie’s waist and lifting her up before dodging to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee, oblivious to what had almost happened, pushed the crates forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, a few customers, who had witnessed what happened, expressed their concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Miss, are you okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should really thank this young man. He saved you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone turned to the couple and said, “Hey, did you not learn any manners? Stop fooling around in public. What if something had happened earlier? Who will take responsibility, huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other customers looked at the young couple angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashamed, the young couple quickly apologized to Natalie and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, after learning about the situation, an employee came over to ask if Natalie was hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, I’m fine,” Natalie replied absentmindedly. Her attention was focused on the man who saved her and was still currently holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wore a black mask that covered most of his face, only revealing a pair of beautiful eyes. He seemed to have a wild and ruthless aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Natalie looked at him, the more she felt that his eyes resembled those of Roger Wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted her gaze from his eyes to his silver hair before she called out, “Roger Wild?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger Wild raised an eyebrow. Although his silver hair was quite conspicuous, he was still slightly surprised that she recognized him so quickly despite only meeting him once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he did not refute her, Natalie asked, sighing in relief, “Were you following me earlier? You scared me. I thought some bad person was after me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger was amused by her words, and the corners of his lips hidden under his mask curved up slightly. After all, this was the first time someone thought that he, D as the assassin, was not a bad person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, seeing that the duo was familiar with each other, an old lady standing at the side said, “Oh, so he’s your boyfriend! He’s really amazing! He acted really quickly earlier. I didn’t even see where he came from!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie laughed awkwardly and said, “No, he’s not my boyfriend.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier when she was pulled away, Natalie’s legs were weak. However, now that she had regained her strength, she subtly moved out of Roger’s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not take advantage of her or make things awkward, naturally letting go of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old lady, who seemed to like playing Cupid, said, “He’s not your boyfriend? Then you should consider going on a date with him. Your meeting is fated. Moreover, he saved you earlier!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie inexplicably felt like she was cheating on Oliver at this moment. She only smiled at the enthusiastic old woman before she quickly pulled Roger away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger did not seem to care about what people thought or said, so she did not expect him to explain anything. Given the current situation, she thought it was best to just retreat out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger looked at the hand that was holding his wrist. The hand was delicate and soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leading Roger to a corner with fewer people, Natalie turned around before she bowed at him and said solemnly, “Thank you for saving me earlier…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was not for him, she did not know what would have happened to her. After all, there were so many crates, and each of them was heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger did not care about this. He leaned against the wall, crossing his legs as he asked, “Have you decided?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want as your repayment,&#34; Roger asked, referring to the time she saved him at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smiled and said, &#34;No need for repayment. I saved you that day because you resemble someone I knew. In fact, uh, even your name is the same. In any case, there’s no need to thank me. By the way, is your injury better?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger did not expect that Natalie would not want anything in return. He said, “Let me thank you. You have nothing to lose. Or, are you afraid of me and don’t want to get involved with me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie replied truthfully, “Both of them. Also, since you have no connection to that person from my past, I don’t think there’s any need for us to interact any further. After all, we… we’re not from the same world.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being rejected by a woman for the first time, Roger felt a sense of novelty. He pulled his mask down, revealing his stunning face before he leaned closer to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie retreated in fear until her back hit the shelves behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger lifted his hand and pointed at the neckline of Natalie’s shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarmed, Natalie raised her voice as she called out, &#34;Mr. Wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, she covered her body in a defensive posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move your hands,&#34; Roger said in a commanding tone, used to ordering people around and even more used to complete obedience from others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored Natalie’s angry glare as he reached out for the necklace hanging around her neck. His emotions were unreadable as he held the pink diamond ring hanging from the chain and asked in a slightly icy voice, “Is this an accessory?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wedding ring,&#34; Natalie said as she pulled the ring back, “Mr. Wild, I’m already married, so please don’t act in ways that might cause my husband to misunderstand me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he had not done anything inappropriate, her goodwill toward him had already been replaced by vigilance at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger let out a low chuckle. In fact, he did not have that kind of interest in her, but hearing her words now, he could not help but say teasingly, “I’m an assassin. I’m not even afraid of killing people. Why would I care if you’re married or not?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked around anxiously and realized that there was no one else nearby. She glared at him angrily and said, “Let me tell you. I’ll remain absolutely faithful to my marriage!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger only found her angry expression amusing. How could he, an assassin, be afraid of her? He could not help but burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wild, like I said before, you don’t owe me anything. You saved me earlier, so just take that as the repayment. Goodbye! I hope you won’t make me regret saving you!” Natalie said before she quickly pushed her shopping cart away, looking as though a terrifying beast was chasing after her.</p>
