                <p>Hailey frowned. She looked worried as she asked hesitantly, “Natalie, was it your carelessness that caused this?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hummer was assigned to Natalie, and she had been sitting on the hood the entire afternoon. It was not impossible for her to accidentally scratch the car. Being careless and accidentally damaging the car reflected her lack of professionalism, and it would definitely be a stain on her modeling career if word of it spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on the person in charge’s face vanished immediately. He asked reproachfully, “What on earth happened, Natalie? Since you damaged the car, you must take responsibility and compensate for it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey said sympathetically, “Natalie, it’ll cost a lot to repair the car. Do you have the means to pay for it? Do you need me to lend you some money?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everyone finished talking, Natalie asked calmly, “So I’m supposed to admit that I scratched the car?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A model scoffed. “Who else could it be but you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though she had just made a big discovery, Hailey said, “Natalie, I just noticed the gems on your waists. Perhaps the gems scratched the car when you were sitting on it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie lowered her head to have a look. Indeed, there was flaky green paint on the edges of the gems that suspiciously resembled the paint of the Hummer. However, the gems were in front of the dress, not at the back. How could she have scratched the car while sitting down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie recalled that after the exhibition ended, and she got off the Hummer, many people, including Hailey, had gone to look at the Hummer. Just about ten minutes ago, Hailey suddenly walked past her and touched her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puzzles fell into place for Natalie immediately. She looked up, and as expected, she saw the gloating expression on Hailey’s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge scolded loudly, “The evidence is conclusive, and you’re still trying to deny it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, as a model, you should be professional. Look at you. If you know you’re careless, you shouldn’t have sat on the car today,” Hailey said with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few unknown models chimed in in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That’s right. Moreover, she has no awareness as a model at all. Sitting on the car just blocks the views of others trying to look at the car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She thinks she’s creative, but she’s clearly just a newcomer who knows nothing!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps if she didn’t sit on the car, the sales of the Hummer would’ve been higher!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge seemed to agree as well, and his gaze grew even more hostile as he said, “I really don’t understand why those judges chose you. Don’t try to deny this. Otherwise, I’ll make sure everyone in the industry knows about this!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If word of this spread, Natalie’s career would indeed suffer a blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey looked at Natalie gloatingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought there was a celebratory dinner. Why haven’t you left yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac ‘coincidentally’ appeared at this time. When he noticed the commotion, he came over to have a look. Next to him was Oliver, who had ordered 31 Hummers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the head of RK Media while the other was a wealthy customer. With this, the person in charge’s sour expression vanished immediately, replaced by a smile as he explained the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you scratch the car?&#34; Oliver asked Natalie. Although he sounded cold, his voice was pleasing to the ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was about to deny it when Oliver pointed at the display car and said, “I’ll buy this one as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Huh?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone, including Natalie, was dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie regained her senses, she felt it was necessary to stop Oliver’s extravagant behavior. She quickly said, “Isaac, Mr. Windsor, I really didn’t scratch the car. I can prove it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge’s expression soured again when he heard Natalie’s voice. He asked mockingly, “What proof do you have?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie removed the detachable gems on her waist and looked at it for a moment before she showed it to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please have a look, everyone. Look at this gem here. Although it’s faint, you can see traces of glue on it. Moreover, look at this gem properly, it clearly doesn’t match the other gems.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hmm, she’s right…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Natalie looked at Hailey and intentionally exclaimed, “Oh, Hailey, your hairpin seems to be missing a gem!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s expression changed slightly. However, she forced herself to calm down as she touched the hairpin on her head and said in confusion, “It’s missing? When? I didn’t touch it since my beauty stylist put it on for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were four diamonds on Hailey’s hairpin, and she had prepared it herself. Just as Natalie had pointed out, she was indeed one diamond at the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How did Natalie notice it?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While everyone looked on suspiciously, Natalie approached Hailey and stuck the diamond in her hand back on the hairpin before saying, “Look, it fits perfectly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Hailey’s expression that was about to crack, Natalie continued to say, “The diamond matches the other diamonds…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac smiled mischievously as he nodded in agreement. “Indeed. What a coincidence…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Isaac glanced at Oliver, who was still expressionless. It was as though Natalie, who was almost framed, had nothing to do with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, anyone with a brain could guess what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey quickly waved her hands. As tears welled up in her eyes, she feigned an innocent expression and said, “It wasn’t me! I don’t know how this happened!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s pitiful and delicate appearance immediately made many male employees pity her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that, Hailey quickly called Adrian to come over, telling him that something had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for Adrian to arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong, Hailey?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey threw herself into Adrian’s arms, crying. “Adrian, the Hummer is scratched. Natalie… Natalie said that I did it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was already in a foul mood after he was outdone by Oliver earlier. He naturally would not give up on a chance to vent his anger. He said, “Natalie, were your blessings for me and Hailey fake? If you have any dissatisfaction, just say it directly! Why must you use this dirty means? This only makes me disgusted with you!”</p>
