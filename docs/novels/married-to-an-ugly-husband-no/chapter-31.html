                <p>Natalie had been frightened at the Windsors’ mansion and had yet to recover. As such, she returned to her room early in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she passed by the master bedroom, her steps hesitated. Oliver had yet to return, and Rosewood Estate was softly lit as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver came home, he went to his bedroom immediately. When he reached the bedroom door, he saw a note stuck on it, which read: Mr. Windsor, I made tomato spaghetti for you. I left it in the fridge so you can have it for supper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handwriting was elegant and pleasing to the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Tomato spaghetti? How cheap!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tore the note off. Just as he was about to throw it away, he hesitated. Then he inexplicably walked to the bedside table and put it away in the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘The handwriting is quite good. I’ll just hold on to it for a few more days…‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Oliver went downstairs again. As expected, there was a plate of spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and cheese balls in the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Isn’t this just ordinary spaghetti?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned in disdain, but he was indeed a little hungry. In the end, he picked up a fork and tasted it. The spaghetti’s texture was good, and the sauce had the right mix of sweet and sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie received an email from RK Media, notifying her of the audition time. The email meant that she had passed the first round of selection and would be proceeding to the next, which had a passing rate of less than ten percent. She quickly shared the good news with Jane, sending a message to the latter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane’s reply came quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane: [Congratulations! You’re born to be a supermodel so I’m sure you won’t have any trouble with the upcoming interview.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending a kneeling emoji, Natalie quickly sent a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: [Thank you for your support!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane: [Hahaha, no problem! Shall we celebrate?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: [Are you free?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane studied photography. Even when she did not have classes, she was still not free. After all, as long as there were scenic places, she would visit to take photos on days when she was free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane: [Darling, you got your first audition after leaving G Entertainment. I’ll definitely make time to celebrate!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Currently, Jane was still unaware that Natalie had replaced Hailey to marry Oliver, let alone the fact that Natalie had to inform Oliver if she wanted to leave Rosewood Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not reply to Jane immediately. Instead, she sent a message to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: [My friend invited me out. Can I go?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had gone to the bathroom and left his phone on the table. When his phone rang, Isaac and Wyatt were shocked. After all, there were very few people who knew his private number. Moreover, among those few people, they usually would not communicate through text messages because Oliver disliked it and found it inefficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt exchanged a look before they instinctively looked at Oliver’s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The caller is ‘Stupid Woman’? Who’s that?” Isaac asked in a low voice, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt said in disbelief, “No, shouldn’t the point be why he gave his private number to a woman?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two were still debating whether to risk looking at the text message when Oliver returned. As he walked over, he asked, “What are both of you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The duo straightened their backs and replied in unison, “Nothing!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless, it was very clear that it was not ‘nothing’. They were obviously up to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at the duo before he finally checked his phone. He only raised his eyebrow slightly when he saw the message from Natalie. Although she had asked if she could go, it was clear that she was being perfunctory. Then, he replied with only two words: You can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not care much about where Natalie was going, but he liked it that she notified him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Isaac and Wyatt exchanged a look as they texted each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Am I hallucinating? Did Oliver actually reply to the message?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: Is it that woman who nearly died previously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not expect Jane would bring her to a high-end private clubhouse to play pool. She pointed at the golden sign above and asked hesitantly, “Is it okay for us to come here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane was wearing a short burgundy wraparound dress today, which accentuated her curvaceous figure. She looked glamorous, and her temperament was cold. Each move she made was like a deadly temptation. Even women would be attracted by her grace and charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane put her arm around Natalie’s shoulders and said, “Why is not okay? Are you underage? Or… are you worried that Adrian will be unhappy?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not. Jane, I…” Natalie said, wanting to explain that she and Adrian had already broken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Jane interjected, “Alright then. Let’s go!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After flashing her membership card, Jane pulled Natalie inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the Watkins family was in decline, Jane had a large savings that she had prepared before the fall of her family. As such, her financial situation now was only slightly worse than before. She also still retained memberships to private clubs and such. Perhaps the only difference was she no longer bought limited-edition clothes, shoes, and bags from luxury brands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“By the way,” Jane said while she chalked the pool cue, “I just found out that Hailey has also been shortlisted for the interview. You have to be careful.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright,” Natalie replied with a nod. She was not surprised that Hailey would try to gain fame at the high-profile RK car show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Natalie and Hailey were models. It was inevitable that they would meet and compete for jobs since they were in the same industry. Apart from the job with RK car show, there was also the gig with Top Avenue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane tested the pool cue, looking somewhat satisfied. Then, she said, “Don’t underestimate her. Confront her head-on! If you lose, let me know!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie laughed. “Why should I let you know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane replied nonchalantly, “So I can beat her up! In any case, I’m all alone now. What I do won’t affect my family.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jane...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m fine. You don’t have to comfort me. It’s been a long time since that incident with my family,” Jane said. She had grown numb to her sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the employee helped them set up the balls, Jane gestured to Natalie to go first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s skills were taught by Jane. In the past, they played together with Flora Lee, but unfortunately, it had been a long time since they saw Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac left the private room with Oliver and the others, Isaac saw two beautiful women playing pool in the corner. He quickly grabbed Oliver and said, “Hey, let’s not leave yet!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at Isaac’s hand that was on his arm with a displeased expression, and Isaac quickly withdrew his hand and said, “Sorry, sorry!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I almost forgot he hates being touched by others…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said to Oliver and Wyatt with a hint of excitement, “Those two beautiful ladies seem quite skilled. Why don’t you come with me to have a look?“</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt did not understand Isaac’s behavior, but seeing how excited the latter was, he nodded reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had no interest in watching Isaac flirt with women, but he caught sight of a figure from the corners of his eyes. He watched the woman chalk the pool cue, lean forward, frame her cue, aim, and hit the balls. The series of movements were executed very smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dusty blue too outlined her body, catching the eyes of several men nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was none other than Natalie who had texted Oliver about two hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s reaction did not escape Isaac’s notice. He could see the interest in Oliver’s gaze. He smiled and asked, “Are you coming?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let&#39;s go,” Oliver said curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt nudged Isaac with his elbow and whispered, “What’s going on?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said, trying to tamp his excitement, “He’s interested in that woman.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt took half a second before he reacted. His eyes lit up, and he asked, “The one in the burgundy dress?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, the one in a blouse!” Isaac said, clicking his tongue in disapproval, “Don’t you know? He likes the charming and innocent type!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s skills could be considered good among women, but compared to Jane, she was still a novice. When Jane hit the balls, three balls fell into the pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, someone called out from behind, “Hey!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned around and immediately ran into someone. Her nose brushed against the other party’s clothing. She instinctively stepped back, and her lower back knocked into the pool table, causing her to fall back.</p>
