                <p>Oliver said over the phone, “Mr. Aura, please be direct if you don’t want to cooperate with me anymore.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the phone, Mr. Aura could feel Oliver&#39;s powerful pressure and chilling hostility. He grew even more anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, the Aura family agreed to help Oliver because the company was experiencing serious tax issues. In the end, Oliver resolved the problem for them. From the very beginning, Oliver had the upper hand in the deal; it was not a fair collaboration. After all, the Aura family needed Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura knew better than anyone else that since Oliver was capable of saving the Aura family from the crisis, he was just as capable of pulling them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura sobered up immediately and broke out in a cold sweat. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have interfered in your personal affairs!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ended the call without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scorching sun was slowly setting behind the western mountain outside the window, emitting a dazzling light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the place he and Natalie had gotten married on a late afternoon. The weather was terrible that day. He had also never seen her radiant beauty when she was a bride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Oliver held Natalie as usual as he went to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was still upset, turning her body away from him and trying to get out of his arms, using as little force as possible to avoid aggravating his injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move!&#34; Oliver suddenly said from behind her. She could feel his warm breath on the back of her neck, causing goosebumps to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t sleep. If you let me go, I won&#39;t disturb your sleep,&#34; Natalie said, struggling lightly a few times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s left hand was on her waist, so he used his right and reached around, gently caressing her cheek as he asked, “Are you still jealous?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice was tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cadence,&#34; he reminded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Natalie denied without hesitation, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver held her chin, stopping her movements before he asked again, “Are you jealous?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of threat could be heard in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was going to deny it again, but when she saw his warning gaze, she said, “Yes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What’s yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I’m jealous,” Natalie said, sounding aggrieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How can there be someone so shameless and unreasonable in this world?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver hummed in satisfaction before he ordered, “Sleep.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is it my imagination, or does he seem to be in a good mood?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie thought of something and said, “Oh, by the way, the recording for the competition I signed up for has been moved up. It starts tomorrow. I’ll prepare your meals in advance, and you can have your assistant pick them up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only response Natalie got was the silence of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when she thought he had fallen asleep, he opened his eyes and asked coldly, “You want to participate in the competition?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Oliver had known about this matter a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Isn&#39;t it obvious?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie silently complained in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Natalie sat up, causing the blanket to fall off her. She shivered involuntarily from the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver turned on the bedside lamp, and the warm yellow light illuminated his face immediately. A playful smirk could be seen on his face at this moment. His light brown eyes also seemed brighter than usual. He felt like he had gotten addicted to teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie studied his expression carefully. After confirming that he was serious, she asked weakly, “Must I kiss you first?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Oliver raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt that the expression on his face seemed to say, ‘We’ve kissed so many times. Why are you still so shy?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay,” Natalie replied softly with her head lowered. Then, she summoned all her courage before she closed her eyes and kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the contrary, Oliver kept his eyes open and watched her. There seemed to be a storm brewing in his eyes at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few beats, she opened her eyes tentatively. There was shyness and tenderness in her beautiful eyes, making it hard for him to look away.</p>
