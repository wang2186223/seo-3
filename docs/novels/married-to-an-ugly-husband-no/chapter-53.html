                <p>&#34;Madam, if you care about the young master, you can personally talk to him. You are his wife, and your words are more persuasive.&#34; Mr. Liam was always good at judging people, and although this Madam was a substitute bride, she was humble and polite, living an organized life. She appeared cold, but was actually a gentle person, and the food she cooked could even open the appetite of the young master, who had anorexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suited the young master very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... uh... forget it.&#34; Natalie awkwardly smiled, frantically shaking her head inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Me, persuade him?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Who knows how he might humiliate me!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Oliver landed, he received a call from Mr. Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master, when will you return home?&#34; Oliver furrowed his brows. Mr. Liam had never asked about his whereabouts before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master, Lady is worried about your health and cares about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had no idea that Mr. Liam, the only person in this house who would put on a smile for her, was quietly selling her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at the gift box in his hands and replied, &#34;I&#39;ll come back today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, who was nonchalant, felt his eyelid twitch. Did he just see a smile on Mr. Windsor&#39;s lips?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bizarre!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even more peculiar was the fact that their usually workaholic boss had personally gone to the auction house in Paris to bid on women&#39;s jewelry!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening approached, Natalie received a call from Jane, who sounded very anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I heard that Hailey and Adrian are going to have an engagement ceremony at the end of the month. Isn&#39;t Adrian your boyfriend? Isn&#39;t Hailey engaged to Mr. Windsor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Engage?&#34; Natalie widened her eyes in shock. &#34;So soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Are those two really in such a hurry?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, what is going on?&#34; Through the phone, Natalie could imagine her best friend&#39;s fierce expression as if she wanted to chop someone up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Let me explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie briefly narrated the whole incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I planned to tell you in person when you arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These people are truly shameless!&#34; Jane, elegant and cold on the outside, was actually fiercely protective, and she was seething with anger. &#34;Hailey not only stole your man but also made you marry that weirdo on her behalf? That woman has been after Oliver since childhood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered herself to be his fiancée, but now that Oliver was ugly and frail, she avoided him at all costs. She got Natalie to marry him in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane, calm down!&#34; Natalie quickly tried to placate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. Let Adrian and Hailey get engaged, and the whore deserves a male dog!&#34; Jane&#39;s tone changed suddenly. &#34;Natalie, you&#39;re telling me this major news now? I&#39;ve already booked my ticket to go back home and I&#39;m at Charles de Gaulle Airport. I&#39;m telling you, you’ll be in big trouble when I come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane...&#34; Natalie sighed, both exasperated and amused. &#39;Luckily, Jane is currently abroad; otherwise, she wouldn&#39;t be at the airport but on her way to confront someone.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you now? Do you... still have feelings for Adrian?&#34; Jane asked cautiously after her outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word from her best friend oozed with genuine concern, and this precious warmth finally diluted the bitterness in Natalie&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already living at Oliver&#39;s estate now. I don&#39;t like Adrian.&#34; She was now Oliver&#39;s wife while Adrian was about to become Hailey&#39;s husband. How could she still have feelings for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she couldn&#39;t like Adrian, and he was even more unworthy of her affection!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why did you agree to marry Oliver instead of Hailey?&#34; Jane couldn&#39;t help but worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For money,&#34; Natalie replied weakly, sinking onto a chair in the garden. Her voice sounded distant, almost absent-minded. &#34;I married Oliver for the money.&#34;</p>
