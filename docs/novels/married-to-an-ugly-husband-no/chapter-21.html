                <p>Oliver&#39;s face instantly darkened. He grabbed Natalie&#39;s delicate chin and forced her to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie held her breath, her clear eyes blinking rapidly. Her fluttering eyelashes exposed the fear in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she just say it casually? Oliver suddenly felt bored, released her, and turned to walk towards the main building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie followed behind him, her gaze falling on his mask. Was he intentionally hiding his true appearance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the Windsor family didn&#39;t know that he hadn&#39;t been disfigured. He had kept it a secret since he was fifteen, for a whole ten years... Such a man was someone a powerful force to be reckoned with!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie tailed behind Oliver, they reached the main building. Victoria&#39;s voice came from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, let&#39;s talk about Oliver. He never bothers to come home for family dinners, and now he marries someone who is not up to our standards at all. If he doesn&#39;t show you respect, why should you? In my opinion, you can remove Ms. Norton from the family cemetery and give her spot to Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie remembered that Oliver&#39;s mother&#39;s surname was Norton. Liam had told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Natalie could react, she saw Oliver take a step forward and raise his right hand...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gunshot rang through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s painful scream followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Victoria!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the hall was in chaos with various loud sounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria curled up on the ground in agony, her right leg trembling and blood gushing out from her wounded thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By her side, Oliver stood coldly with a gun in his right hand, his expression indifferent and menacing, as if he were not the one who had just shot his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recovering from the shock, Henry angrily kicked Oliver. He glared at Oliver like an enemy and said, &#34;Have you gone crazy?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the man in a silver mask, others fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except for Hailey, who was visiting the Windsor family for the first time, everyone else was watching Oliver in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver casually slid his hand into his pocket and calmly locked eyes with Henry. Obviously, he wasn&#39;t intimidated by Henry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the smug expression on Oliver&#39;s face, Natalie sensed that he wasn&#39;t afraid of anyone or anything at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, it hurts! My leg hurts!&#34; Victoria trembled in pain and was drenched in cold sweat. But she still remembered that Henry was the only person who could save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Henry averted his gaze in frustration and shouted, &#34;Call a doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody moves.&#34; Oliver&#39;s gaze lightly swept over the servants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants lowered their heads and didn&#39;t dare to continue their work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, I&#39;ll call a doctor for you!&#34; Hailey had never met Oliver before. She thought, &#39;All the important figures in the Windsor family are here. This masked man couldn&#39;t be more powerful than the prestigious Windsors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This is my opportunity to show my worth as Victoria is Adrian&#39;s mother. She&#39;s gonna be my future mother-in-law!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hailey could take a step, there was another gunshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey screamed, her face turning pale with fear. Her legs buckled violently and she didn&#39;t dare to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black bullet was lodged in her shoe, narrowly missing her foot. There was a hole in her wide-legged pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver shot Hailey a look sarcastically, confident that she wouldn&#39;t try to help Victoria again. He handed the gun to Natalie and commanded, &#34;Take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK...&#34; Natalie blinked and received the gun with both hands. The scorching heat from the barrel nearly burned her trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Oliver, how could you shoot Mom? Get a doctor for her immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian&#39;s face turned extremely embarrassed, but he didn&#39;t dare to make any rash moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t even spare Adrian a glance and slowly strode toward Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Victoria. Did you just suggest removing Mom from the family cemetery?&#34; Oliver&#39;s voice was low and soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Dad never loved her. With her family&#39;s power, she forced Dad to marry her!&#34; Victoria shouted, suppressing her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver lowered his gaze and chuckled, sending shivers down everyone&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next moment, his leather shoe stomped on Victoria&#39;s fingers and started grinding. The manor&#39;s courtyard echoed with Victoria&#39;s screams of agony. In comparison, Oliver&#39;s calm face seemed more gruesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was so shocked that she could hardly breathe. She finally understood why the Windsors&#39; expressions changed drastically upon seeing Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had heard of Oliver&#39;s bad temper, but seeing it firsthand sent shivers down her spine. In hindsight, his previous treatment of her seemed truly kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, she&#39;s your sister! Let her go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry felt sorry for Victoria and tried to persuade Oliver but failed. Others did not dare to approach Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian could only watch helplessly as Oliver tortured Victoria. Unfortunately, he had no power over Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie was not only shocked by Oliver&#39;s ferocity but she was also shocked by Adrian&#39;s cowardice. After all, Victoria was Adrian&#39;s mother. Yet, Adrian did not dare to openly defy Oliver. She could not help but wonder why she fell for such a coward earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria?&#34; Oliver said indifferently. Looking down at her like a king surveying his servant, he asked, &#34;Do you know what you did wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34; The pain and fear of death completely destroyed Victoria. The tough woman was gone. She immediately begged for mercy, and her previous arrogance was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry, Oliver! I shouldn&#39;t have disrespected your mother! Please forgive me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mother isn&#39;t someone you can speak ill of,&#34; Oliver warned as he finally reined in his wrath. Then, he said to the crowd, &#34;Call a doctor. Hopefully, she won&#39;t lose a limb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded so sincere, acting like he was not the culprit of Victoria&#39;s injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shivering, a servant looked at Henry for confirmation before dashing off to call the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of you, stay. Since I&#39;m back, let&#39;s have a meal together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s order eliminated their hope of using Victoria as an excuse to flee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was furious, but he had to suck it up. He said, &#34;Oliver... Uncle Oliver, I think I shall accompany Mom to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered, &#34;You think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one forbade Adrian to have such thoughts. But thinking about it was enough. In other words, no matter what Adrian wanted, Oliver&#39;s order came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Victoria was brought away, and the bloody floor was swiftly wiped clean by the servants. In just a few minutes, everything returned to normal. Apart from Victoria&#39;s absence, no traces of what had just happened could be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Oliver beckoned to Natalie. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie collected herself immediately. She assumed he was asking for the gun, so she quickly walked over and handed the cold gun to him with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on to it,&#34; Oliver said. When he saw her pale face, he could not help but tease her with a mocking smile, &#34;Are you scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh...No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded instinctively, but then she shook her head after realizing the situation. She thought, &#39;Oliver is truly a demon!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver wasn&#39;t convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew what she was thinking about, but he chose not to expose her. Instead, he glanced at the maid standing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid understood immediately and asked respectfully, &#34;What can I do for you, sir?&#34;</p>
