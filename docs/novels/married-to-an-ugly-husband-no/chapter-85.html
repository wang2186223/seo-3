                <p>“The assassin from the DIE Organization was a new hire. When you left the bar yesterday without your bodyguards, he decided to take action…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words, Natalie was only involved in this matter because of Oliver. In fact, if Wyatt and Isaac did not call her out last night, she would not have experienced those terrifying things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt could not help but feel nervous when he thought about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, few people know that you’re the boss of RK Group. Very few people also know your appearance. For you to be targeted, I suspect an insider leaking information,” Isaac said, analyzing the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a few suspects previously. Go and investigate,” Oliver said coldly with a hint of anger. He also thought that it was likely that someone had betrayed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Wyatt, who was usually in charge of tasks like this, replied. Then, he added, “Oliver, there’s something strange about this. After this incident, the leader of the DIE Organization, D, didn’t make arrangements for the deceased assassin’s family. It’s said that… the assassin targeted someone he shouldn’t have…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Targeted someone he shouldn’t have targeted?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver narrowed his eyes. He was the target, and the only person with him at that time was Natalie. In short, the person the assassin should not have targeted was Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt had long come to this conclusion, hence he hesitated when he spoke earlier. He said, “No one knows who D really is…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac muttered, “This can’t be right. D’s influence in the secret society is no less powerful than that of Oliver. His identity is also as mysterious as that of Oliver. He doesn’t seem like someone Natalie would know…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Isaac thought about it, the more he was convinced it was impossible for Natalie to have any connection with Roger at all, which would have been true if it were not for Roger’s past and the unexpected encounter at the hospital previously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Isaac asked, suddenly changing the topic, “Oliver, when do you plan to reveal your identity?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s gaze fell on the wedding ring on his left hand as he replied, “Soon.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie entered Rosy May&#39;s office, Rosy was watching a show, looking very amused as she chuckled to herself. She looked very relaxed, not at all like a top doctor at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy turned off her iPad, seemingly unaware of the strange expression on Natalie’s face as she explained, “Although this show seems absurd, it’s a great way to relieve stress.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was going to ask Rosy about Oliver’s condition and also instructions for his subsequent care. However, before she could do so, Rosy, who was single, said with a sigh, “Hey, how did a bad-tempered person like Oliver manage to marry a gentle woman like you? This world is so unfair!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Dr. May, must you tease me all the time?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy was in a cheerful mood, and she was particularly chatty toward Natalie, whom she had a good impression of. She continued to say, “To be honest, I really didn’t want to have anything to do with Oliver in the beginning. After all, I’d feel intimidated just seeing him. However, later on, I found out he was Arthur’s older brother, and we became acquainted. As time passed, I realized he’s not only talented, but he’s a good person as well. His personal life is also clean. Well, as for his bad temper, I guess it’s a common trait among geniuses…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Rosy was praising Oliver, Natalie was only focused on one thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Arthur?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arthur is his brother. He’s two years younger than Oliver, and he’s a medical genius. However, they two had some issues several years ago and have fallen out since…” Rosy said. Then, she could not help but warn, “It’s best if you don’t take the initiative to mention this matter to Oliver.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Natalie replied. However, she could not help but feel like she had heard the name before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie returned to the ward, Isaac and Wyatt had already left, and Charles had brought some important documents over for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital bed was slightly raised, and Oliver sat on it, holding a pen in his left hand. As Charles handed the documents to him, he signed his name smoothly and neatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him. She could not read what was written on the document, but she could see the name he had signed: Simon Frost. She was not particularly surprised, chalking it up to another one of his aliases and identities. When she finally looked away, she finally noticed Oliver staring at her. She quickly waved her hands and explained, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to peek! I only saw your signature, nothing else!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is there something you want to ask me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver made no move to hide the documents. It was clear he did not mind Natalie knowing about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, there were very few people in the world who knew that Simon Frost, the person in control of RK Group, and Oliver were the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stood respectfully and quietly by the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought about it for a moment. When her eyes fell on his hand holding the pain, she asked, “Are you left-handed? I didn’t know this! Your handwriting is really beautiful…”&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight twitch could be seen at the corner of the usually emotionless Charles’ lips when he heard this question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her, unsure of what to say of the foolish woman in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Natalie was curious, but she was just not curious enough to investigate or ask about it. She glanced at her phone and saw that it was almost noon, so she said, “Dr. May said you can eat now. Should I buy you some food?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, cook for me,” Oliver said. He did not even like the meals cooked by the top chef at home. How could he like the food bought from outside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright, is there anything you want to eat?” Natalie asked. She was also worried that the food bought from outside would not be clean or nutritious enough, so she did not refuse him. Moreover, there was a small kitchen in the VIP ward, provided for family members of VIP patients to cook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her face, which was bathed in the golden sunlight. He could even see the peach fuzz on her face at this moment. After two seconds, he replied, “You.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles immediately took a step back and lowered his head slightly, pretending that he did not hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s cheeks flushed red immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘H-how can he say such things?! Charles is right here! Did he hit his head last night?! After all, he’s been behaving abnormally!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied after seeing the embarrassed expression on Natalie’s face, Oliver said calmly, “Just cook whatever.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not respond, still fuming over his behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smirked and asked teasingly, “What are you thinking? Why are you blushing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Nothing!” Natalie said with a pout, annoyed. Then, she quickly grabbed her bag before she left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver chuckled softly as he looked at the woman’s red ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidentally, there was a large supermarket near the hospital, so Natalie went there to buy groceries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Oliver was still recovering, she decided to cook something light and nutritious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through shopping for groceries, Natalie suddenly felt that someone was following her.</p>
