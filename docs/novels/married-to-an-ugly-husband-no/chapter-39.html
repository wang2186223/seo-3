                <p>As Natalie approached the changing rooms, someone suddenly grabbed her from behind. A hand quickly covered her mouth to silence her before she was pulled into the men’s bathroom and pressed against the door. She could sense the extremely aggressive and masculine aura immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she looked up and saw the incredibly handsome face, her eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver?! What are you doing here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, realization dawned on her, and she asked, “Were you sitting in the back row of the audience seats earlier?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow, surprised. “How did you know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I just had a feeling that someone was sitting in the back row…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Natalie recalled the black hole she had seen on the buckets that had exploded. She had not paid attention at that time, but now that she thought about it, she thought that it might have been a bullet hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie asked tremblingly, “Did you shoot the buckets and cause them to explode?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If his aim had been slightly off, someone could’ve lost their life!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, you’re finally catching on…” Oliver said with a dark expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mr. Windsor, you seem unhappy. Did I… Did I offend you in some way?” Natalie asked, biting her lip. She felt that he was here to look for trouble with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at the timid woman in front of him. She was completely different from the assertive and domineering woman on stage earlier. He held her chin and asked slowly, “Mrs. Windsor, you haven’t even worn a bikini in front of your husband, but you wore it for others to see. Are you trying to trick me? Tell me now, how do you think you’ve offended me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But that’s what the company requires! It was for work!” Natalie said as she thought to herself, ‘It’s not like I dressed that way intentionally. Does he think I really wanted to dress that way?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s voice was not low, and coincidentally, someone entered the men’s bathroom at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of men’s shoes could be heard as someone said, puzzled, “A woman’s voice?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another person said, “Just mind your business. Perhaps someone’s having a rendezvous here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The former laughed. “You’re right. How exciting!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the conversation ended, the sound of water could be heard from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s cheeks turned red from the teasing comments and the strange sounds of water. There was also the man in front of her who was extremely close to her. He was only a hair’s breadth away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you...” Oliver began to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly covered his mouth with her hand and shook her head vigorously. At the same time, she looked at him pleadingly, silently urging him not to speak. She was afraid of being discovered, and her state now was completely different from the glamor that models were used to in the fashion industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s eyes flashed slightly as he felt her soft palm against his lips; his feelings were indescribable at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man outside asked in confusion, “Huh, why is it so quiet now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His companion laughed. “Maybe the guy couldn’t handle it and passed out!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s heart skipped a beat, and she instinctively looked at Oliver. As expected, his expression had darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, in the next moment, a hint of a smile suddenly appeared in his eyes, and he suddenly licked Natalie’s palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ah!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moist sensation was like an electric shock that spread rapidly through Natalie’s body. Startled, she let out a scream and quickly withdrew her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you doing?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did I do?” Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You licked me!” Natalie glared at Oliver indignantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Natalie spoke, the men outside laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey, what did you do? Where did you lick?” one of them asked teasingly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt both embarrassed and annoyed that she had said something that was misunderstood in that manner. She really wanted to stomp her foot in anger at this moment. If it were not for the fact that she did not want to expose herself, she really wanted to open the door so the two lecherous men could see what was really going on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored the two men’s laughter. He stared at the woman trapped in his arms. Her head was lowered, looking shy and innocent. He asked, “What’s there to be shy about? Have you forgotten that you’re my wife?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But you don’t treat me like your wife…” Natalie muttered with her head lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hmm? What did you say?” Oliver narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly changed her words, saying, “I said that the attire today was a work requirement. I’ll try not to do it again next time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she lifted her head. She was unaware that Oliver was also looking down at her. Due to their close proximity, as soon as she lifted her head, her lips met those of Oliver’s accurately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, their lips only brushed past each other, but this time, their lips were pressed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened in shock, and she even forgot to breathe. She even saw a hint of surprise in Oliver’s eyes that also contained a hint of surprise. Unlike how cold he was, his lips were incredibly soft and warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Oliver’s gaze darkened as he felt the softness of the woman in front of him. He slowly clenched his hands into fists as the urge to kiss her fiercely rose in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Oliver was about to deepen the kiss, Natalie suddenly leaned back. The back of her head hit the door, preventing her from moving further back, and she quickly tilted her head to avoid him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The desire in Oliver’s eyes was instantly extinguished, replaced by their usual iciness. However, the feel of her lips lingered in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pushed against his chest with both hands, looking uneasy as she whispered, “Oliver, I… I need to change.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver pinched her earlobe and said in a deep and cold voice, “Remember what I said today. If you don’t listen, then there’s no need to keep your ears, understand?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Understood!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie covered her ears hastily as she nodded. She was afraid of what Oliver might do to her ears. At the same time, she wondered inwardly, ‘Was it my imagination when I felt that he wanted to kiss me earlier?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Natalie thought about it, the more she felt that it was her imagination. Why would a madman like Oliver want to kiss her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that it was silent outside, Natalie opened the door cautiously a crack and looked outside through a narrow slit. After confirming that there was no one around, she quickly rushed out with her clothes in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“N-Natalie?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Natalie walked out, she saw Isaac looking at her with a dumbfounded expression on his face. He had come looking for Oliver after seeing that Oliver had not returned for a long time. Unexpectedly, he saw Oliver and Natalie come out from a cubicle in the men’s bathroom together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How scandalous!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“H-hello, Isaac…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie covered her face, embarrassed that she was caught in the men’s bathroom. Without another word, she quickly rushed out to change her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac grinned and said, “Oliver, you used to be abstinent. I didn’t expect that you’d be unable to resist the pursuit of excitement and did such a thing in the bathroom.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at the custom Frida Bailey watch on his left hand before he said expressionlessly, “If that was true, do you think I’d only take twenty minutes?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not!” Isaac said, “I’m sure you have endless stamina and can last seven rounds!”</p>
