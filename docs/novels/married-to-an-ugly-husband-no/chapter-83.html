                <p>Natalie gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her intently as he supported her body with his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried that he would kiss her again, she quickly said, comprising, “I… I’ll try to like you and fall in love with you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Natalie knew that these words were perfunctory. Loving someone wholeheartedly was akin to digging your own grave. In any case, she would still keep her words to him. She would be good to him, but it would be due to duty, commitment, and gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tightened his hold on Natalie, and she instinctively wanted to struggle. However, in the end, she thought the better of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Appeased, Oliver touched the corner of her lip with his thumb and asked, “Do you have any request for me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened in surprise. “I… I can make a request?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pondered for a moment, “Can you let me live on campus when the semester begins?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Oliver’s face darkened immediately as he said, “Come up with another request!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t think of any at the moment,&#34; Natalie said, feeling that any request she made would be rejected anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tried to be patient as he asked, “Aren’t you interested in my loyalty to our marriage or my affection for you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head, saying, &#34;Loyalty is not something that can be demanded or guaranteed. As for affection...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie trailed off for a moment. A never-seen-before determination, confidence, and honesty flashed in her eyes before she continued to say, “Oliver, I have no interest in asking things that are out of my reach.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a coughing sound rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt had followed the duo out earlier, driven by their curiosity to find out what was going on between the two. They really did not expect to encounter such a scene. Initially, they intended to leave quietly, but they suddenly saw the duo passionately kissing. Isaac was so shocked that he almost choked on his saliva because he could tell that Natalie was not very enthusiastic about the kiss. After all, even if women begged Oliver to kiss them, it was likely that he would not even spare them a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie saw Isaac and Wyatt with an awkward and teasing expression on their faces, she blushed and covered her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘When did these two come?!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver seized the chance and hugged Natalie, pressing her face against his chest as he said, &#34;Get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, okay, we didn’t see anything. Goodbye!” Isaac said with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie drove the Land Rover along the dark road. She was a careful driver, prioritizing safety over speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was growing impatient with the slow speed, but surprisingly, he was very calm. He would have reprimanded his driver if his driver had driven at this excruciatingly slow speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had always been very alert and aware of his surroundings. At this moment, a wary expression suddenly appeared on his face. He looked at the black off-road vehicle behind them through the rearview mirror. Initially, he had assumed it was just a coincidence, but as time passed, especially after they took a turn, he grew certain that the car was tailing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step on the pedal!&#34; Oliver suddenly ordered. At the same time, he gripped the steering wheel and forcefully turned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie screamed in fright, but she instinctively stepped on the pedal as Oliver controlled the steering wheel. Their actions were surprisingly tacit. Before she could ask what was going on, she heard Oliver say, “Don’t stop, keep going! We’re going to make a right at the next intersection!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s tone was no longer lazy or leisurely. Instead, it was cold and ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Natalie asked tremblingly. She listened to him and turned at the intersection. She naturally could tell that something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look back,&#34; Oliver said with a hint of tension in his voice that she had never heard before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was not a skilled driver nor did she have much experience driving this kind of car. It was not surprising that she was unable to utilize the full speed of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Oliver pulled out a small safe from under the seat and quickly opened it up, revealing a silver gun inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next moment…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had fired a shot and accurately hit his target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the rearview mirror, Natalie clearly saw one of the tires of the black off-road vehicle exploding. In the next moment, she watched as the vehicle veered off to the side before it went back on track. To her horror, she saw a hand holding a gun extending out of the driver’s side of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, be careful! He has a gun!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re afraid, then don&#39;t look,&#34; Oliver said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Oliver’s objective was only to stop that car and not injure the people who were tailing them. As such, he only aimed for the tires. After all, he was not sure if they were just going to tail him or do something else. However, now that the other party had brought out a gun, his suspicion had been confirmed, and he no longer held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the gun was silenced, Natalie felt her ears ringing from the gunshots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Land Rover was not bulletproof, and when the bullets hit the rear end, it caused the car to shake violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s palms were sweaty, her heart was pounding, and her mind was racing. She pressed her foot down on the pedal, taking every turn she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rear windshield had already shattered, and the night wind blew into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that the distance between the two cars was closing up, Natalie felt like she had never been so close to death before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Oliver shattered the other party’s windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other party was becoming desperate, and they began to aim their gun toward Natalie, hoping to get rid of the troublesome driver first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shivered at the thought that death might be approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver lunged over. He unfastened her seatbelt with quick movements. Then, he held her tightly before he pushed the door open and jumped out of the car. At the same time, he said reassuringly, “Don’t be afraid.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a driver, the Land Rover lost control. Its sudden decrease in speed caused the vehicle behind it to collide with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boom!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The collision was deafening, and flames soared up in just a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tightly protected Natalie in his arms. He tried to shield her with his body, hoping to cushion her body and lessen the impact when they hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his protection, Natalie could still feel the powerful impact upon landing. They tumbled several times before they finally came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the ordeal was finally over, they both lay flat on the ground which was covered in overgrown weeds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Oliver reached out and grabbed Natalie, pulling her on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver?&#34; Natalie called out, but she realized that his eyes were already closed and quickly climbed off him. She could feel that her hands were damp. Although she could not see clearly due to the darkness, the smell told her it was blood immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping out of a moving vehicle at such a high speed was tantamount to seeking death, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, wake up!&#34; Natalie called out, panicking. Her hands trembled as she tried to stop his bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullet was meant for her, but he had blocked it for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, Oliver, don’t scare me! Wake up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver? Can you hear me? Open your eyes and look at me!”</p>
