                <p>“Who knows? She’s just an unknown model!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing the words ‘unknown model’, Natalie felt a twinge in her heart. If it were not for G Entertainment using her to pave the way for Hailey, she would not have been an unknown model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie recollected herself before she sized Noah up from head to toe. Noah was still dressed in a Valentino suit and had added inches to height with her platform shoes. She smiled lightly and asked, “Miss Noah, if you make it with your height, why can’t I?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah was furious. She hated it when people mentioned her height. It had always been her dream to become a supermodel, and her height was her biggest obstacle. At most, she could only be a print model. This time, she had received special treatment thanks to her family connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by her anger, Natalie swung her hand at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie reached out and grabbed Noah’s hand, pushing the latter back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah stumbled back and ended up falling to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey, who had been silent all this time, rushed over to help Noah. Then, she pointed at Natalie and asked, “Natalie, how could you hit Noah? Is it because Adrian doesn’t like you so you’re taking it out on her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was speechless. Only a few days had passed by her older sister’s talent for fabricating stories and stirring up trouble had increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, it’s not Adrian’s fault that he doesn’t like you,” Hailey said with a sad expression on her face, “Even if you like Adrian, I hope you won’t interfere in my relationship with him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah quickly chimed in, “That’s right. I’m telling you, my brother has a great relationship with Hailey. Don’t even think about getting involved.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, someone said, “Oh, dear. As it turns out, she’s a third party! A little unknown model like her actually has thoughts about Mr. Harrington. What a joke!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as one person spoke, the others followed suit, criticizing Natalie and demanding that she leave the audition and the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This woman is pretty, but I didn’t expect her to be so despicable!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get lost! Why don’t you leave? Don’t bother auditioning!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although some of them were driven by a sense of justice, there were also some who only spoke up because they wanted to eliminate Natalie, whom they saw as a strong competitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a clear laughter rang in the air, interrupting everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at Natalie, who had suddenly burst out laughing, in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said, “Miss Watson, you’re the only one who treats Adrian as a treasure. You should keep an eye on him. I heard that he frequents All Night Manor and contributes significantly to their nightly income!“</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What cost the most at All Night Manor? Alcohol? No, it was the escorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane had told Natalie about this in the past. Initially, Natalie chose to believe in Adrian because she did not see it with her own eyes, but now…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You&#39;re talking nonsense!” Noah refuted. Then, she turned to Hailey, explaining anxiously with a red face, “Hailey, don’t listen to her nonsense! My brother would never do that!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey forced a smile on her face and said, “I believe in Adrian.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said with a shrug, “Alright then. He’s your boyfriend, after all. Whether you believe it or not has nothing to do with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this sentence, Natalie completely distanced herself from Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the models, who were criticizing Natalie earlier, fell silent and chose not to speak for the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah gritted her teeth. She naturally knew what her brother was like. Indeed, it was just as Natalie had said, but she had to defend her brother after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The models were divided into 40 groups, and each group had five people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was in the 19th group, and she did not know anyone in her group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as Natalie’s group was about to enter, Hailey and Noah suddenly came over with someone from the audition team, replacing two models in the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We have to change the order all of a sudden. Alright, get ready,” the employee said before flashing a fawning smile at Hailey and Noah, saying, “Miss Noah, are you satisfied with this arrangement?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah nodded before looking at Natalie provocatively and arrogantly. It was as though she wanted to show off how the influence of her family allowed her to easily change groups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey said insincerely, “Natalie, do your best later!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah said snidely, “What’s the point of doing her best? I’m afraid she won’t be selected anyway.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sienna had likely not told the company about the termination of Natalie’s contract so Hailey was confident that she could suppress Natalie with the company’s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An employee opened the double doors, revealing a spacious room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the room, a Maserati GranCabrio was displayed on stage. Its eye-catching lemon color looked even more eye-catching under the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights in the audience seats were only turned on for the first row where the judges were seated. The judges comprised of three men and two women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the group walked in, the other two models could not help but speak among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wow! This car must cost millions! RK’s interviews are always so flashy with their luxury cars.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isn’t Isaac supposed to come? Why don’t I see him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee looked at the duo and scolded, “Keep quiet. Otherwise, your points will be deducted.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“S-Sorry!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The duo exchanged a look and quickly fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie’s eyes fell on the back row of the audience seat. It was dark there, and she could not see anything. However, for some reason, she felt as though someone was staring at her from that direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from that, Natalie felt that the five judges were behaving rather strangely. They sat abnormally straight with extremely solemn expressions on their faces. It was as though they were being supervised by their boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Treat this car as a prop. The five of you will audition at the same time. We’ll begin after you find the position.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the employee spoke, Noah shot a look at the two models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two models understood the meaning immediately. They stepped forward and quickly blocked Natalie’s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned and said in a low voice, “Please let me through.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just give up. This is because you offended Miss Noah and Miss Watson. We can’t afford to provoke them either.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only four positions to pose with the convertible sports car; the front, the left side, the right side, and the rear. Needless to say, the front was naturally the best position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>RK Media had deliberately placed the models in groups of five to stimulate competition. As such, they naturally would turn a blind eye to such things unless a physical fight broke out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the back row of the audience seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two people sat in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Isaac’s head was lowered as he sent a message to Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: The beautiful Natalie has appeared! She’s auditioning in a bikini! Do you want me to take pictures of the bikini beauties for you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>DT Technology had recently taken on a billion-dollar project, so Wyatt had been very busy with work recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a few seconds before Wyatt finally replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: You made the models audition in bikinis?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though he had done something smart, Isaac was very proud when he replied to Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Yes! The models are dressed in black bikinis!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt sent the latest information he had found out about Natalie to Isaac before he sent another message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: You’re dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac opened the file, and soon, his eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Damn it! Natalie… She’s the person from the Watson family who married Oliver?!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver,” Isaac asked tremblingly, “Is Natalie… Is she from the Watson family? Is she… your wife?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, who was sitting with his legs crossed, looked at Isaac expressionlessly and replied with a grunt, “Yes.”</p>
