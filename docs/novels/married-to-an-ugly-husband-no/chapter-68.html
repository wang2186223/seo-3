                <p>Natalie shook her head, immediately denying that terrifying thought. Rather than saying he did it for her, it was more convincing to say that he did it to anger Adrian. Based on her experience at the Windsor’s mansion, it was clear he disliked his nephew, Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Starry Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a spacious hall in the north wing of the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sounds of laughter and glasses clinking filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations on the success of the autumn car exhibition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cheers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few people, like Natalie, came for the food, but most people were here to network.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the dinner, a few models sat on the laps of some executives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One executive, Mr. Brown, approached Natalie with a drink and asked, “Are you Isaac’s woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s expression darkened, and she moved away from the man, saying, “No, I’m not.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown’s smile widened immediately. “Great! Why don’t you join me? You won’t regret it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown extended his hand toward Natalie, but she quickly stood up and avoided his hand. She said, “Thank you for your offer, but my goal is to become an international supermodel. I don’t think you’ll be able to help me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown’s smile vanished immediately. “How dare you refuse me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown&#39;s voice was loud, and it quickly attracted the attention of people nearby. However, they only watched and did not step forward to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps the situation would be better if no one had noticed, but now, with so many people watching, Mr. Brown felt as though his dignity had been challenged. He felt that if he did not deal with Natalie, he would become a laughingstock. For this reason, he grabbed Natalie’s wrist, intending to forcibly kiss her in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re just an unknown model with no support. What gives you the right to refuse me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other models just watched, enjoying the show. Many of them envied Natalie, and now that she was being bullied, they found satisfaction in watching her suffer. Moreover, most of those without any background and support would frequently run into such a situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Mr. Brown leaned in, Natalie suddenly said, “Who said I have no support?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown hesitated, but he still said, &#34;You&#39;re lying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pretended to be calm as she took out her phone and said seriously, &#34;Sir, if you don&#39;t let go of me now, I&#39;ll call Isaac immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying!&#34; Mr. Brown snarled, revealing a set of teeth stained by smoking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s heart raced in her chest. After all, she was bluffing. She did not have Isaac’s number at all. She only had a few contacts on her phone, and among them, there were only a few male college mates. The only person who could help her was Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing the nervous expression on Natalie’s face, Mr. Brown was convinced that she was only bluffing. Hence, he reached out to touch her face and said, “Alright, go ahead and call him!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie dodged his hand with an expression of disgust. At the same time, she no longer hesitated and dialed Oliver’s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire place fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low and melodious rang out from the loudspeaker. Based on the voice alone, one could tell the owner of the voice was noble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown froze as soon as he heard the male voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this Isaac? It&#39;s Natalie!&#34; Natalie said urgently, “I want to leave the celebration dinner early. Is that okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie held her breath, afraid that Oliver might say that he was not Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the colorful lights and loud music, Oliver walked out of the private room. He narrowed his eyes and asked, “Where are you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not know why Oliver asked that. She was just grateful he did not deny that he was Isaac. She quickly gave him her location and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You think you can just call a man and fool me? I’ve seen through your tricks. That voice definitely doesn’t belong to Isaac!” Mr. Brown said angrily, “Moreover, Isaac has never given his personal number to a random woman!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown grabbed Natalie’s phone and rudely threw it aside. He chuckled sinisterly and approached Natalie again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door of the private room was kicked open from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac!&#34; someone exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Mr. Brown had a chance to look, he was kicked and sent flying, sprawling on the ground, unable to get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell...&#34; Mr. Brown was just about to curse when he looked up. He trembled immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked down at Mr. Brown with ice-cold rage as Isaac stood next to him with a frosty smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Brown did not know Oliver, so he could only turn to look at Isaac.</p>
