                <p>In Oliver’s opinion, the women Isaac knew could not compare with Natalie at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What an imbecile!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, someone noticed the shiny men’s platinum ring on Oliver’s finger and said, “Windsor, I didn’t expect you to wear a fancy ring like this…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most men’s rings looked similar, and their differences usually lay in their details. As such, it was hard to tell at a glance that Oliver was wearing a wedding ring. Moreover, no one would have imagined the powerful and influential man, who was only 26 years old, had married so early. In their opinion, marriage was such a dreadful task, and it was better to enjoy the single life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at his wedding ring, feeling a sense of belonging wearing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt raised an eyebrow. He knew that Oliver had not worn the ring before. The fact that Oliver suddenly wore it only meant that Natalie’s position in his heart had truly changed. At the very least, it was not just a casual fling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver still had not returned home, so Natalie went to bed first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, she had a dream. She dreamed of the time when she was 15 years old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her fifth year with the Watsons at that time, but she still felt out of place. It was not just with the Watsons, but she also felt out of place in school. The girls in school, led by Hailey and Noah, gave her all sorts of trouble. They would call her a bast*rd, leave her on clean-up duty alone, forget to tell her about assignments, and blame her for all sorts of things. In short, her high school life was extremely miserable. Her only source of light at that time was Roger Wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger Wild was Natalie’s classmate. He was a handsome young boy, but he was silent and reserved. He usually kept to himself. Perhaps that was why many people called him a fool. However, that ‘fool’ was the only one in school who would help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their sophomore year, they went to the north mountain in Paykston on a school trip. At that time, Natalie was tricked by a few girls and ended up taking the wrong path. When she finally arrived at the destination, she learned that Roger Wild was missing. She still remembered what Hailey had said at that time, taunting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That fool went looking for you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie followed the others to search for him, and at some point, she heard a scream. She ran over, panting, and only saw Roger’s phone lying near the edge of a cliff. Below the cliff was a river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needless to say, the school canceled the trip due to Roger’s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Roger’s body was never found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie screamed as she jolted awake, drenched in cold sweat. She was the reflection of her pale face on the floor-to-ceiling window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger was not only her only light during her youth, but he was also someone she was indebted to. Perhaps that was why she had done the boldest thing in her twenty years of life at the hospital when she protected that man who resembled Roger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from Roger, no one knew the actual reason behind his departure that day. No one knew for certain that he really left to look for Natalie. It was even more impossible for people to find out how he had fallen off the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie was awakened by the nightmare, it was only 12 am. She was unable to return to sleep. She sat on the bed, looking out of the window in a daze. The master bedroom had a great view, overlooking the night view of Paykston.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Natalie’s phone suddenly rang. The caller ID showed an unfamiliar number. She assumed it was a prank call, so she did not hesitate as she canceled the call. However, when the other party called again and again, she finally answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, who is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister-in-law, it&#39;s Wyatt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hello. What’s the matter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie still remembered the handsome young man who played the referee in the clubhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister-in-law, Oliver is drunk. Can you come and get him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?! Now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Based on her previous experience with Oliver when he was drunk, Natalie was really reluctant to go and pick him up. She asked, “Did you call Charles?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Wyatt turned the loudspeaker on, and Isaac listened in on the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing Natalie’s words, Isaac rolled his eyes and shook his head, thinking, ‘Sure enough. Oliver is in a bad mood because of her. She’s clearly very reluctant to come…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s expression remained unchanged as he continued to persuade Natalie, saying, “Charles took the night off to attend to some matters in his family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed and tried to hide her reluctance as she said, “Oh, alright then. Where are you guys?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie recalled that Wyatt seemed like a serious young man. If she had received a call from Isaac, she would have wondered if Isaac was playing a prank on her. In her opinion, Wyatt did not seem like the type to do such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt gave her the address before reminding Natalie to be safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call, Isaac burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wyatt, you’re perfect for sneaky schemes. You can keep such a straight face even when you’re lying!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind your words,&#34; Wyatt said, glancing at Isaac. He wondered if Isaac only spoke properly when he was trying to pick up girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this hour, all the servants in Rosewood Estate had gone to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took the key to the Land Rover that Oliver had previously placed on the coffee table before leaving the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had obtained her driving license as soon as she was of age. Although her driving skills were not exceptional, it was not a problem for her to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the exclusive member-only bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorman had already been informed and led Natalie toward the private room. He knocked on the door twice and opened it as he said, “Miss, please enter.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the women in the room were dressed flamboyantly while the men dressed more simply. Despite their simple outfits, it was clear that they were expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with lively music and colorful lights. The men and the women were immersed in enjoying themselves and failed to notice Natalie’s arrival. Only one person noticed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not know how, but as soon as Natalie appeared, he noticed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood by the door, with her hands folded neatly in front of her as she looked around as though she was searching for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is she here?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of surprise flashed briefly in Oliver’s eyes before he beckoned to the woman closest to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman’s eyes widened, pleasantly surprised. She hurriedly put down the wine bottle in her hand and rushed over to Oliver’s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was not only handsome, but among the men present, he had the most extraordinary temperament. The woman could see that even Isaac treated him with great respect. Although no one knew his identity, it was clear to everyone that he was not simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver grabbed the woman’s wrist and pulled her toward him, she was overjoyed. She sat on Oliver’s lap and wrapped her arms around his with practiced ease, pressing her body against his while she pretended to be shy.</p>
