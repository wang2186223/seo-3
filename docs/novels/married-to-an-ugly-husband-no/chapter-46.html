                <p>She felt grateful for this revelation because it allowed her to cut off the last trace of gratitude she had toward Robert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a servant exclaimed, “Miss Natalie, you’re back!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert’s expression changed immediately. He spun around and asked in shock, “Natalie, when did you return?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie handed the three gifts Liam prepared to the servant as she replied, “Just now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert studied Natalie’s face for a moment. Seeing that she was so calm, he felt that she must not have heard his words earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam prepared a diamond-encrusted ring for Robert, a diamond bracelet for Mrs. Watson, and a diamond pendant for Hailey. They were all of excellent quality and worth millions. However, in Rosewood Estate, they were only considered ordinary items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look, Natalie. We weren’t trying to harm you when we married you to Oliver back then. Look at how he spoils you now,” Mrs. Watson said as she touched her diamond bracelet happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘They’re just material things…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not say anything. After all, she had long known that Mrs. Watson was very materialistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Hailey put the diamond pendant aside, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Didn’t they say that Oliver has a peculiar temperament and is cruel? Why does he treat Natalie so well?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey felt even more uncomfortable when she recalled the ‘Mr. Windsor’ who seemed to have taken a liking to Natalie after the audition. The more she thought about this, the angrier she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is Natalie, a married woman, able to seduce such a handsome man?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not want to stay any longer than she had to, so she asked directly, “Dad, why did you call me back?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was initially furious. However, seeing that Natalie brought gifts back, his anger had subsided a lot. He asked, “Natalie, do you want to explain the termination of your contract with G Entertainment? G Entertainment is our company. It’s better for you to stay in the company than to go elsewhere.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sienna was very busy taking care of Hailey and she didn’t have time for me at all. That’s why she terminated the contract.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was unaware of the details of the termination of the contract, and it was impossible for Sienna to reveal that Natalie had blackmailed her. Otherwise, her secret dealings in the company would be exposed. As such, Sienna could only take full responsibility for the termination of the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then, why don’t you re-sign with the company?” Robert asked. It was as though Natalie still had some use to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver doesn’t want me to…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not hesitate to use Oliver’s name. After all, they were the ones who forced her to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert sighed. He did not dare to offend Oliver, so he could only give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey looked at Robert with tears eyes and called out pitifully, “Daddy!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was immediately reminded of the promise he made to Hailey. He turned to Natalie and said, “Natalie, it’s fine if you don’t want to work in our company. However, you must give up the position of the main model of Scene B in the autumn car exhibition to your sister.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing these words, Natalie burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson instantly sensed Natalie’s unwillingness and mockery, and her temper flared up immediately. She slammed her hands on the table loudly and scolded, “What kind of attitude is that? Who do you think you are? You’re just an illegitimate child! Hailey is the legitimate daughter of the Watson family! It’s only right for the best to be given to her!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mrs. Watson, did I obtain the position using the resources of the Watson family? No. Did I obtain it during my time in G Entertainment? No,” Natalie said as she glanced at Hailey, “Hence, she’s not entitled to this. Do you think I’d hand over something I obtained so easily?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mom, look at her! She’s mocking me for failing to get the main position! On the day of the accident, there was an accident, and I was drenched in water! My hair was in a mess, and my makeup was ruined! That’s why I didn’t perform well! Natalie, on the other hand, didn’t get splashed by the water at all!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy, I just won the Best Newcomer award! If I only have a regular position for the car exhibition, what will others think of me?” Hailey asked as tears streamed down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey passed the interview, but she placed third, which meant that she was only assigned an ordinary luxury car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson consoled Hailey in a low voice while Robert also comforted his ‘darling daughter’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had grown accustomed and numb to such scenes. Hailey had always been the only precious one in the Watson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert’s patience was running out, and he did not hesitate to use his ultimate weapon. “Natalie, you must give your position to Hailey. Otherwise, we won’t fund Lucas’ treatment!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Robert in shock and disbelief. “Dad! You promised me that you’d take care of Lucas’ treatment as long I marry Oliver!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That was when you were a contracted artist under G Entertainment. However, you’re not now. So what kind of promise are you talking about?” Robert said with a sneer, “If Mr. Windsor really cares about you, then you can ask him to pay for Lucas’ treatment. If not, you should just listen to your family!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie refused to compromise. She knew that if she compromised once, she would have to compromise more in the future. She said, “If you’re going to force me, then I have no choice but to tell Oliver that the one he was supposed to marry was Hailey, the eldest daughter of the Watson family. I’ll tell him that I’m the replacement you found ten years ago! Since you want to drag me down, I’ll just drag everyone down with me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did you say? How dare you threaten me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Robert rose to his feet and slapped Natalie across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud and crisp noise rang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s mind went blank. Her left cheek was tingling and burning, and she could taste blood in her mouth. She raised her hand and wiped the blood off the corner of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert could not stand being defied. He said angrily, “Let me tell you. Don’t even think about leaving today if you don’t agree to do this. You want to complain to Oliver? Let’s see how you’re going to complain when you can’t even leave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey wiped her tears away and looked at Natalie provocatively. She was determined to get the position of the main model for Scene B since it would give her international exposure. She thought to herself triumphantly, ‘So what if you were selected? You’d still end up being my stepping stone…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie thought to herself, ‘What era do you think we’re living in? If I really want to complain, do I have to do it in person? What’s the use of mobile phones then?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Natalie did not say these out loud. After all, there was no way she could really tell Oliver the truth. Her title and identity were fake, and she did not have his affection. How could he ever listen to her complaints? She did not have the habit of humiliating herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a servant hurried in, saying, “Master, Madam, Miss, Mr. Windsor is here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?” Robert, who had just sat on the couch, leaped up. He could not hide the guilt and panic on his aging face when he looked at Natalie’s swollen left cheek. Even if Oliver did not care about Natalie, Natalie was still his wife after all. If they hurt Natalie, it was no different from humiliating Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson was panicking as well. She looked left and right. Thinking that it would take a while for them to deal with the situation, she looked at Natalie and said threateningly, “Stay in the room and don’t come out, understand?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Mrs. Watson turned to the servant and said, “Bring her upstairs!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Miss, this way please,” the servant said. Although she sympathized with Natalie, there was nothing she could do since Natalie was just an unfavored illegitimate daughter.“</p>
