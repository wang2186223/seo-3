                <p>The necklace comfortably pressed against her skin, the gems cool and the pearls lustrous. Natalie stood there like a model, waiting for Oliver&#39;s admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver nodded in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, the necklace looked even more stunning on her than he had imagined. It wasn&#39;t the necklace complementing the person, but the person enhancing the necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know I got you this gift?&#34; Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Mr. Liam wasn&#39;t aware of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac told me,&#34; Natalie carefully took off the necklace, intending to put it back in the wardrobe later for safekeeping, letting it serve as a decoration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver narrowed his eyes. &#34;That idiot Isaac!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having woken up late, Natalie cooked a bowl of plain soy sauce noodles for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soy sauce noodles were a simple dish in the Su style. After boiling the noodles in a pot of water, they were lifted and placed in a bowl, along with the toppings, using long chopsticks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie deliberately used a bone broth and sprinkled some chopped scallions. She also fried a sunny side-up egg, its color beautiful and fragrance captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver took a bite of the egg, savoring its smooth, runny yolk that filled his mouth with rich flavors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a bite, he set down his chopsticks. &#34;Woman, tell me again what you promised me yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? What promise?&#34; Natalie had just sat down, thinking he was going to bring up the matter of the kiss, her cheeks instantly turning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The promise you made to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank goodness it&#39;s not about the kiss!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Natalie felt far from relaxed, looking at Oliver&#39;s composed appearance and realizing he intentionally brought it up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had overheard her words yesterday, about marrying him for money. Any man would fly into a rage upon hearing such words, let alone someone as proud as Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that he hadn&#39;t killed her already was a relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath, glanced at the chopped scallions in her bowl, and said, &#34;I promise that from now on, I will wholeheartedly treat you as my husband and take good care of your life, treating you well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak up,&#34; Oliver commanded, arms crossed and expressionless. &#34;Look at me when you speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise from now on, I will wholeheartedly treat you as my husband, take good care of your life, and treat you well!&#34; Natalie, feeling both angry and embarrassed, wanted to hit someone. &#34;Is that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having heard what, he wanted to hear; Oliver remained unsatisfied. He stared at her and asked, &#34;Did you marry me for the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Since he had heard it yesterday anyway and there was no point in hiding it, Natalie said calmly, &#34;My brother is sick. If I don&#39;t obey the Watson family, they will stop paying for my brother&#39;s medical expenses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, another important brother emerged!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually married him for her brother!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember what you just said!&#34; Oliver decided not to bring up this gloomy topic that was affecting his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ate with elegance, even when eating the most ordinary noodles, he exuded a sense of nobility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he ate quickly. By the time Natalie had only eaten half, he had already wiped his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s gaze fell on her lips again, and he unconsciously licked his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two seconds later, he abruptly shifted his gaze away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, it might be inconvenient for me to return to the Rosewood Estate after school starts. Can I not stay here?&#34; Natalie had just finished speaking when the man across from her looked at her sharply, his gaze biting cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, are you asking for a separation from me?&#34; Oliver&#39;s eyebrows raised playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we are already sleeping separately, and if I move out...&#34; Natalie didn&#39;t dare finish her sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear she felt when he caught her saying she married him for money yesterday came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie considered his reasons for disagreeing and reassured him, &#34;Mr. Windsor, don&#39;t worry, my school apartment has a kitchen. Charles can come and fetch your meals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he really angry over a few meals?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is Oliver really this petty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Natalie with a gloomy expression, but for a moment, he couldn&#39;t think of a reason to keep Natalie around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph, Natalie was his wife. Did he need a reason to keep her at the Rosewood Estate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Oliver firmly replied with two words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, he instructed Mr. Liam, &#34;Mr. Liam, move her toiletries to my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Natalie stood up in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her. Wasn&#39;t his meaning clear enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, do you want me to sleep with you?&#34; After saying the word &#34;sleep,&#34; Natalie&#39;s face turned red, &#34;I don&#39;t want to... is that okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s eyes turned cold and rebellious, silently giving her a negative answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were licensed professionals, so shouldn&#39;t they sleep together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... Achoo!&#34; Natalie quickly turned around and sneezed forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nose was itching, and she sneezed twice more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught a cold from searching outside for things all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver mentally scolded Isaac again and looked at Natalie with disdain, &#34;You&#39;re so foolish, yet you still want to go out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since yesterday, Oliver had been in a bad mood. After finishing his meal, he didn&#39;t stay in the main building for a moment longer and seemed reluctant to even look at Natalie for an extra second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sneezed again. Actually, living at the Rosewood Estate was possible, but someone would need to pick her up and drop her off every day, which was inconvenient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh God, the problem now isn&#39;t going to school, but having to share a bed with Oliver!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s unbearable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady, this is cold medicine.&#34; Mr. Liam left for a moment and came back with a few medicine boxes in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr. Liam.&#34; In Natalie&#39;s eyes, this old man was the best person in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Liam chuckled, &#34;If the lady wants to thank someone, thank the young master. It was his idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie inwardly scoffed. After Oliver&#39;s disdainful attitude towards her just now, how could he be getting her the medicine? It must be Mr. Liam being nice to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed heavily, unable to understand what Oliver was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he initially arranged for her to stay in a separate guest room instead of the master bedroom, it showed that he was a territorial and possessive person. So why suddenly must she stay in the master bedroom?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>RK Group, Asia Headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two stunning men walked into the CEO&#39;s office on the 72nd floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they entered, they smelled a strong aroma of food, making their mouths water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, you&#39;re over your anorexia?&#34; Wyatt looked shocked at the four dishes and one soup on the golden nanmu wood table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pan-fried barramundi fillet, tomato red wine braised beef, stir-fried prawns with broccoli, Modena black vinegar beef salad, and a bowl of lamb and black bean soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exquisite and high-end meals were served in delicate redwood lunch boxes. They weren&#39;t fancy in terms of presentation compared to their usual fine dining, but the aroma and color combination were appetizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What surprised Isaac and Wyatt was that most of the dishes had already been consumed by Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Oliver took a bite of beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large pieces of beef were tender and chewy, the sourness of the tomatoes balanced out the taste of the beef. The fragrance of the red wine was brought to its peak, and the mushrooms added a delicious texture.</p>
