                <p>&#34;This is a normal physiological reaction for men,” Oliver said. His expression did not at all. Clearly, he did not feel awkward about the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I, I know…” Natalie stammered. However, knowing and experiencing it were two very different things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie got off the bed clumsily and avoided looking at Oliver as she tidied up her clothes. At the same time, her cheeks turned red again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Oliver suddenly said, “Help me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Help you with what?” Natalie asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought he wanted her to help him sit up, so she reached out to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she extended her hand, he suddenly held her and looked at a certain place meaningfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie finally realized what he had meant by ‘help me’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me...&#34; Oliver said again, holding Natalie’s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stepped back, shaking her head in refusal as she said, “I… I don’t want to…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver still did not let go of her hand. He looked at her seriously as he said, “Please…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him with wide eyes, shaking her head vigorously. However, in the end, she was persuaded by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s face was red as she rushed into the bathroom. While she was washing her hands, she suddenly remembered something. She quickly ran out to open the windows for ventilation. She made sure all of the windows were open before she returned to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, at this moment, someone knocked thrice on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Rosy pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, I’m here to exami…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy’s voice trailed off nearing the end. She looked at Oliver, the opened windows, and Natalie before she said worriedly, “Didn’t I say that you should avoid vigorous activities during the period of recovery?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy was a doctor and an adult woman. How could she not understand what had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Dr. May, we, we didn’t…” Natalie stammered, blushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy waved her hand and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s normal for husbands and wives to be intimate. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. The important thing is to be happy. Being happy is the key to having a long-lasting relationship!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie covered her face in embarrassment, unable to explain herself. In the end, she could only glare at a certain person resentfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Oliver said, rescuing Natalie from the embarrassing situation, “Aren’t you here to examine me? Don’t talk so much nonsense!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy May rolled her eyes in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hurriedly bade farewell to Rosy and left the room. She went to the empty room next door, which had been prepared for her, to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your arms…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy noticed that Oliver seemed to have aggravated his injuries again, especially the ones on his arms. She was going to admonish him again but ultimately decided against it, knowing that it would only be futile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy quietly examined Oliver before giving him a few instructions and leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat on the bed, thinking about Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘As long as she’s good to me, I’ll spoil her to the extreme…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not want to stay in the hospital any longer. After the third day, he insisted on being discharged. Fortunately, his physique was several times better than ordinary people, and he healed very quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Rosy could only discharge the unruly patient in her care. However, she told him that he had to use a wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was unsurprisingly resistant to the idea. He did not even use a wheelchair after his accident ten years ago. He did not think he needed to sit in a wheelchair now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Oliver was about to refuse, Natalie pushed a wheelchair in and said softly, “Oliver, I’ll push you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, Oliver quickly swallowed the ‘no’ that was hanging from the tip of his tongue back into his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had known Oliver for over a decade. He was present during the time Oliver was recovering from the terrible accident ten years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Oliver was in a terrible state, but he still refused to use a wheelchair. He endured the pain and rather used the crutches than sit on the wheelchair, refusing to show any signs of weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For this reason, Isaac was shocked when he saw Oliver sitting in a wheelchair with a blanket draped over his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you staring at?&#34; Oliver asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing!&#34; Isaac replied. At the same time, he thought to himself, ‘Natalie is really awesome!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam had been waiting anxiously at Rosewood Estate for several days now. As soon as the Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled into the driveway, he quickly stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Young Master, are you okay? How do you feel? How am I going to explain this to the Old Madam?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Grandma know?&#34; Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! I daren’t tell her for fear of scaring her into having a heart attack!” Liam said, At the same time, he sighed in relief after confirming that Oliver was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don’t worry. I didn’t sustain any major injuries,” Oliver said reassuringly before briefly explaining his condition to Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt both guilty and grateful toward Oliver even though she knew that the assassin’s target was actually Oliver. However, there was no doubt that he was injured trying to protect her. Due to her guilt and gratitude, she was extra attentive when she took care of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she took care of him, she gradually grew accustomed to him, treating him as her savior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The competition for Top Avenue was about to begin, and Natalie finally finished reading the notice and schedule issued by the organizer. That was when she realized that she no longer had an agent to represent her or help her deal with matters and that she had to handle everything on her own now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours passed before she finally returned to the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat on the oversized, looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, do you need anything?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past two days, Oliver had been working on the bed. Since his room was usually off-limits to the servants, Natalie had been bringing his documents in and out for him. Once in a while, she even worked as a French translator for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to take a shower,” Oliver said in a commanding tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor advised against showering over the next few days. You risk infecting your wounds by doing so,” Natalie persuaded, hoping that the adult man in front of her would listen to reason for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, then wipe me down,” Oliver said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-wipe, wipe you down? Me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie almost bit her tongue. At the same time, the image of her muscular body when she first saw him appeared in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I… I’ll get one of the servants to help you,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, do you want others to see your husband’s body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’ll get a male servant to help you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words, Natalie just did not want to help him wipe his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don’t feel comfortable with that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, I’ll get one of the female servants to help you?” Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver said through gritted teeth, &#34;Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Natalie could only agree. She sighed and reluctantly went to the bathroom to make preparations. She knew he had a slight obsession with cleanliness. He had probably reached his limits after not showering for a few days. It was only right for her to help him clean up as his caretaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie returned with a basin of hot water and a towel after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can you close your eyes?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her red face and ordered, “Undress me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie only sighed. She knew it was futile to argue with such a domineering man. Her hands trembled slightly as she touched his clothes. He was dressed in a set of blue checkered loungewear today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched slightly when she saw his chest. She could not help but feel like a rogue at this moment. When she saw the bandage wrapped around his torso, her embarrassment disappeared completely. She could also see the various scars on his shoulders and arms. Most of them were injuries he had sustained while he protected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was staring intently at Natalie, so he noticed how her expression changed from one of embarrassment to one of guilt. For some reason, it stirred up his emotions again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he said, “Aren’t you going to help me clean up?”</p>
