                <p>&#34;No! That&#39;s not true! I don&#39;t want you to touch me at all!&#34; she said hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s face darkened instantly, his voice cold as ice. &#34;Would you dare say it again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he had no feelings for her, she was his wife in name after all, and her words were nothing but rejecting and insulting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Natalie thought, &#39;You want me to say it again? Fine!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she blurted out while glaring at him, &#34;I don&#39;t want to sleep with you at all! And I don&#39;t want you to touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next second, she was flung against a bookshelf, her back pressing against the cold wood and spines of books, causing a slight pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver quickly pressed up against her, his face close, his hazel eyes dark and deep. Such a gaze was intimidating to anyone, and she felt as if he could see right through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you playing hard to get?&#34; he said, sinister and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Natalie felt a moment of speechlessness. She thought, &#39;He&#39;s such a narcissist!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly occurred to her that Hailey bought the gift the day before the wedding, and it was Hailey who wrapped gift and gave it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Hailey!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was done by that bitch Hailey!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked up at Oliver only to see a cruel smile on his face. The way he looked at her showed no respect or care at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had heard many rumors about him, including one where he had beaten a rich heir at a dinner party so badly that the man ended up paralyzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, he had kicked the pricey glass into pieces last night. She was sure that if she offended him, she&#39;d end up the same as the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I&#39;m sorry... Just pretend I was never here!&#34; Natalie said. Though he got her wrong, she knew very well that the smart move was to take the blame for now. After all, she&#39;d be the one suffering if she pissed him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to seduce me again, or I&#39;ll toss you out regardless of who you are.&#34; Oliver let go of her. &#34;Scram!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie fled away at once. The sight bugged Oliver even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought, &#39;Those clowns in the family have been trying to get women around me as their spies, so I simply married one so as to put an end to their schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I hate women with an agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But why? When I heard her say she didn&#39;t want me, I actually was angry for a second.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie went back to the room and called Hailey furiously. She wanted to get to the bottom of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, did you put the lingerie in the gift box?&#34; she questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. So?&#34; Hailey admitted unabashedly, triumphant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey hated Natalie the most. She hated Natalie&#39;s enchanting face and figure, hated that Natalie always stole her thunder, and hated that Natalie used to be Adrian&#39;s love!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do that? You&#39;re already with Adrian, and I&#39;ve married Oliver on your behalf!&#34; Natalie was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted you to experience how great sex is. But I&#39;m afraid Oliver isn&#39;t up to it given his condition, right?&#34; Hailey laughed. &#34;Natalie, just out of curiosity, exactly how ugly is Oliver?&#34;</p>
