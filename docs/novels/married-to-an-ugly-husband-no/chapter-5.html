                <p>Blushing, Natalie covered her eyes and turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she had seen a man shirtless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver curled up his lips and smiled mockingly, thinking, &#39;You came to me, and you&#39;re asking me who I am?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Nice act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Over the years, countless women have tried to seduce me using every way. I&#39;ve seen plenty of your kind, pretending to be innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Lame tricks like this only disgust me, you stupid gal！&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to play dumb to get my attention?&#34; Oliver&#39;s voice was cold and mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought, &#39;Get your attention? I certainly have not!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She apologized to the silhouette behind the glass, &#34;Oliver, don&#39;t listen to him! That&#39;s not true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, she turned to the half-naked, handsome man standing next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said, &#34;Why would you say that? I&#39;ve never seen you before! Even though my newlywed husband isn&#39;t handsome, I wouldn&#39;t fall for you either!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver let out a brief, cold snort, his eyes icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kicked away the pricey glass. In the next second, Natalie saw a mannequin dressed custom-made suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was dumbfounded, thinking, &#39;A mannequin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Oliver see Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a pair of innocent eyes, a delicate nose, and rosy lips. Her features were enchantingly beautiful yet pure, and her beauty was simply breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, in terms of appearance, she was totally his type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her actions offended him. She mistook a mannequin for him and called him ugly repeatedly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver lunged up and used two slender, fair fingers to squeeze Natalie&#39;s jaw, and then he saw the obvious panic on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Instead of playing dumb, you might as well take off all your clothes. That might get me interested,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#39;m not playing dumb. I...&#34; Natalie tried to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s light brown pupils were cold and full of irony, his handsome face utterly sullen. It was as if he was the most terrifying man in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Natalie was so close to a strange man. She was forced to look him in the eye, and the great pressure was suffocating her. Her heart was pounding, and her face was deadly pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry!&#34; Natalie extricated herself from Oliver and bowed in apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to apologize no matter who he was, for she had a feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she talked back, he would strangle her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie put on a pair of pajamas, but she didn&#39;t notice the loose neckline. When she bent over, her deep cleavage was out right under Oliver&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing but titillating under the bright light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, he thought, &#39;Sure enough, she&#39;s now trying to seduce me sexually.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sneering, he said, his eyes gloomy, &#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hurriedly left the room as quickly as if she had escaped death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Liam downstairs, she went to verify with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Learning that the man was indeed Oliver, she felt like crying. &#34;Don&#39;t people always say that Oliver is both ugly and frail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, only the dumb spread the rumors. Seeing is believing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought, &#39;He is far from frail or ugly. The rumors got that wrong. But he&#39;s indeed a weirdo with a temper!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed in frustration and continued to think, &#39;No one took me seriously the moment I arrived, and on the first day I was here, I offended Oliver. How am I supposed to negotiate terms with him now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Without his permission, I can&#39;t leave the estate or the West Hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;The guards won&#39;t open the gate, and I can&#39;t walk down the vast West Hills on my legs, can I?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie fell asleep deeply depressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was awakened by the ringing of her cellphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she saw the caller ID, her pretty face instantly turned cold.</p>
