                <p>&#34;Natalie, I...&#34; Adrian had a sudden enlightenment. Guilt swarmed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that he would take responsibility for Hailey because it was his libido talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about Natalie&#39;s question, Adrian suddenly connected the dots. His eyes filled not only with astonishment but also with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, are you saying that you never wanted to marry Oliver? Did Hailey make you take her place? If you didn&#39;t marry Oliver of your free will, come back to me! Oliver hasn&#39;t slept with you, right? I doubt his tattered body can handle the task.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian didn&#39;t notice Natalie&#39;s hostile attitude and reached for her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie discreetly pushed his hand away, thinking to herself, &#39;I don&#39;t want his filthy hands on me! He slept with Hailey, claiming that he would take responsibility for her. Now, he wants me back? Who&#39;s gonna be the other woman in this relationship? Me or Hailey?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, I will not reconcile with you. It&#39;s impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Adrian didn&#39;t understand. &#34;Oliver is disfigured, and he&#39;s dying. No one in the Windsor family likes that pathetic loser! What do you see in him? Natalie, I understand. You spoke nice things about Oliver to please them. But you can always tell me the truth! I know you hate Oliver!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said that I was lying to please them?&#34; Natalie feigned a sweet smile. &#34;Adrian, disfigured or not, Oliver has never cheated on me. He&#39;s in poor health, but I will take care of him. Even though his family doesn&#39;t like him, I do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, acting shy. &#34;How would you say for sure that Oliver couldn&#39;t get it up? Have you tested him? I&#39;m telling you from first-hand experience that he can do it all night long!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was so furious that he choked on his breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I know you are saying these things just to anger me.&#34; Adrian didn&#39;t believe her. &#34;You&#39;re still mad at me because of Hailey? That night was really a misunderstanding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that night was a misunderstanding, what about the times after that? Were every kiss and every time you slept with her all misunderstandings?&#34; Natalie couldn&#39;t hold back her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, if you couldn&#39;t think clearly and constantly caused misunderstandings for over a month, I suggest that you get your brain checked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed and furious, Adrian strode toward Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to shut Natalie up with a searing kiss as every word out of her mouth would only anger him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie noticed that his eyes were burning with wrath and desire and scurried backward in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could take another step back, she slammed into a man behind her. The person grabbed her and pulled her into strong arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the person&#39;s solid muscles and taut skin through their thin clothes. And the sense of power of this embrace made her feel safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nostrils were filled with a familiar and alluring scent with a hint of tobacco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, you neglect to tell him that I can do it all day too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s calm and low voice sounded behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s body tensed. She felt his hand encircling her waist, his breath gently fanning the top of her head, causing her to tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned around, she didn&#39;t see Oliver&#39;s handsome face as she expected. Instead, she saw a delicate silver mask. It extended from his forehead to his strong jawline, covering the entire left side of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only see a part of his right cheek and his eyes. Looking into his calm eyes, she couldn&#39;t detect any emotions, but she surely felt his power. One might think that only someone from the freezing hell could possess such eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the rumors about Oliver, people might assume that Oliver&#39;s mask was a cover for his disfigured face. But Natalie knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver?! I-I thought you weren&#39;t coming over!&#34; Even though she couldn&#39;t see his face, Natalie knew the man was Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else exuded such a dominant and arrogant aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, didn&#39;t I satisfy you during the daytime too?&#34; Oliver asked again, his voice grew huskier, making it more captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t expect to hear such a provocative announcement from Natalie when he came to fetch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I don&#39;t... You...&#34; Natalie flushed violently in a second. She wanted to explain, but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You what?&#34; Oliver raised an eyebrow, his tone carrying a hint of warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie resignedly nodded, thinking, &#39;Whatever you say!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really didn&#39;t want to discuss this topic with him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ol...Uncle.&#34; Adrian looked at Oliver with an embarrassed expression. Just a moment ago, he was casually calling him Oliver. But he didn&#39;t dare to do so in front of Oliver and could only obediently call him Uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And...Oliver was standing behind Natalie, his posture a show of absolute protection and possession!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe...they really had slept together?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at Adrian aloofly, as if he was merely a servant, and said, &#34;Adress Natalie properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Oliver, Natalie and I are friends, and we...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s expression darkened, and he cut Adrian off. &#34;Adrian, she&#39;s your aunt-in-law. You should call her Aunt Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian reluctantly turned to Natalie before muttering, &#34;Aunt Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title left Natalie both amused and satisfied in an indescribable way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few minutes ago, Adrian was acting all tough, yet now he had to respect Natalie despite how reluctant he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still here? Natalie and I are gonna have a moment. Do you wanna stay and watch us?&#34; Oliver seemed inexplicably displeased by Adrian&#39;s enamored gaze and shielded Natalie from Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t pay attention to Oliver&#39;s unusual affectionate attitude toward her. &#34;Adrian, Hailey must be looking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was implying that he should leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Oliver were acting like a real couple and it was driving Adrian crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Oliver, since you&#39;re back, you should say hi to Grandfather. I&#39;m going.&#34; Adrian glanced at Natalie with mixed feelings and left with long strides, fists clenching by his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, he thought, &#39;What was so good about that ugly freak Oliver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He couldn&#39;t even show his face in public and he could have Natalie. Why couldn&#39;t I?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Adrian had an idea and it cheered him up greatly. &#39;As Oliver can sleep with her, I can too.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Windsor&#39;s mansion was lush and serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Adrian&#39;s departure, Natalie felt the power and strength emanating from Oliver even more distinctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip and tried to break free from his embrace, but with a single movement, he pushed her against the rockery. Trapped between him and the rockery, she couldn&#39;t move. Oliver&#39;s presence became even more overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll take care of me and you like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver found Natalie&#39;s awkward and helpless demeanor quite pleasing to the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up, it was the first time Oliver knew what it felt like to be protected by someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the eyes of others, Oliver was so powerful that he didn&#39;t need protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when he was merely a child, he never showed any signs of weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was unlike others. She was defenseless in front of him, but she called him a good husband and told his family that she would like him even though all of them didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver couldn&#39;t come up with a proper description of his feelings when Charles repeated her words to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a clear spring flowing through barren soil?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like dawn breaking through the darkness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps these words are a little exaggerated, but he definitely felt something similar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not... Oliver, I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about earlier! Please don&#39;t take it seriously!&#34; Natalie was afraid of his reaction.</p>
