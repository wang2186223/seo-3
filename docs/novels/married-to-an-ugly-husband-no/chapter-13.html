                <p>Oliver, who had no interest in women was forcefully kissed by a hostess. The whole place fell into a deathly silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards stood frozen, not daring to touch the woman on Oliver&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt a soft body collide with his, then tightly embrace him as if afraid he would push her away. The woman&#39;s face was only inches away from his, but they didn&#39;t kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her warm breath blew over his ear and nape. Her soft hair brushed against his cheek, like feathers tickling the tip of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Natalie&#39;s first time taking the initiative to get close to a man. She was so nervous that her heart skipped a beat. Her fingertips were trembling too, but she couldn&#39;t let go; she couldn&#39;t get caught!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, they&#39;re so scary. Can you make them leave?&#34; Natalie pinched her voice, trying to sound sweet and flirtatious. So, the bodyguards wouldn&#39;t be suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt an uncontrollable surge of heat. He cursed inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away!&#34; he said coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes, Sir!&#34; The bodyguards trembled in fear, swallowing hard. They didn&#39;t think Natalie would dare to sit on Oliver&#39;s lap. They left the private room quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was strange in the room. No one dared to make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac snapped back to reality and hastily captured a photo, forwarding it to Wyatt: [Oliver was kissed by a girl!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he saw the photo, Wyatt thought it was fake. But upon closer examination, he realized it was real!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: [Awesome! Who is she?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: [A hostess from the nightclub.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: [Is she still alive?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: [At the moment, yep.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your new way of seducing me?&#34; Oliver&#39;s voice was cold and low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only he knew that this was the only way to hide the emotion in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No!&#34; Natalie felt unfairly accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was evil as he didn&#39;t help Natalie in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then get off me!&#34; Oliver growled lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie finally snapped back to reality, jumping off Oliver as if she had been electrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little did she expect that in her haste, she exerted too much force, and her head collided with his, brushing her lips against his in the process. At that moment, she froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie realized something and she looked at Oliver&#39;s crotch in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had crossed his legs and showed no signs of anything unusual. His face remained as cold and forbidding as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she had misunderstood earlier?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she must have been mistaken. Oliver loathed her so much that it was impossible for him to react to her in that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t seduce me.&#34; Oliver couldn&#39;t believe that he was turned on by this woman. &#34;Look again, and I&#39;ll gouge out your eyes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, just now I was just...acting on impulse,&#34; Natalie hurriedly covered her eyes and gave up on explaining. &#34;Anyway, thank you for saving me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly escaped the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Oliver closed his eyes, as his fingers unconsciously brushed his lips. The taste of her lips lingered, carrying a peculiar sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze shifted from Natalie back to Oliver, but for quite some time, he did not receive any instructions from Oliver to capture her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt sent another text message: [Is she still alive?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac felt like he had discovered a new world: [Wow! Can you believe it?! That woman made a clean getaway!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie returned to the Rosewood Estate, but Oliver had not returned yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restlessly, she sat in the living room, waiting for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, aren&#39;t you going to sleep now?&#34; Liam asked as he approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll wait for him. There are things I need to explain to him.&#34; Natalie replied, glancing at the clock, realizing it was already past midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she met Oliver in a place like All Night Manor. And she even kissed him by accident! What if he was mad at her? Would he punish the Watsons instead? Then, what would happen to Lucas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock kept on ticking, and it was getting very late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After such a day, she was exhausted. She slowly closed her eyes, and before she knew it, she drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver returned around 3 a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened the door, he saw Natalie curled up on the sofa, with both hands supporting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, she has been waiting for you the whole night. She said she had something to explain to you,&#34; the maid said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver walked next to her and looked at her delicate face. Without makeup, her natural look was much better than wearing heavy makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleeping on her side, her face was gently pressed against her hand, making a pout— a cute sight that contrasted with her hot look on the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips moved a few times as if she were muttering something in her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, Oliver leaned over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s voice was a soft, sweet purr, making Oliver&#39;s heart flutter involuntarily. A second later, her muttering continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bastard! You absolute bastard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s face instantly darkened, and he turned around expressionlessly and headed upstairs, his back emanating waves of icy disregard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, should we attend to Mrs. Windsor?&#34; the confused servant asked, gesturing towards Natalie, who was still fast asleep on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie should&#39;ve been waiting for Oliver. But there she was, having fallen asleep on the sofa and even cursing him in her dreams!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if she had something important to say or if she was just concocting another one of schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering her antics at All Night Manor, her so-called job, and his own unwelcome physical reactions, Oliver felt a surge of perplexing anger rise within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Oliver had dismissed Natalie, the servants didn&#39;t dare intervene. They left Natalie undisturbed on the couch all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Natalie&#39;s sleep was anything but peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her dream, Lucas was being neglected by the Watson family at the hospital, and she feared that he lacked the funds to continue his chemotherapy treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted from her slumber, Natalie found her forehead covered in cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discomfort of her stiffened body jolted her mind back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up, momentarily disoriented by her unfamiliar surroundings. The sky outside glowed with the faint light of pre-dawn, a pale streak of luminescence edging the eastern horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the clock, Natalie realized with a start that it was nearly six o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she had spent the entire night on the couch?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s coat hung in the hallway, silent proof that he had returned but chose to ignore Natalie&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, the weather wasn&#39;t chilly, so Natalie&#39;s overnight stay on the couch wouldn&#39;t lead to sickness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing back to her room for a quick tidy-up, Natalie made her way downstairs again, only to find Oliver already seated at the dining table, deeply engrossed in his breakfast alongside a finance magazine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Hailey knew that Oliver wasn&#39;t just not ugly—he was actually quite attractive. Then she wouldn&#39;t have coerced Natalie into this loveless marriage, saving her from having to deal with this surly man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Oliver,&#34; Natalie hesitated, her inner monologue churning with sarcasm, yet she couldn&#39;t bring herself to confront Oliver directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver didn&#39;t even glance up, acting as though he neither saw nor heard Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending servants bowed their heads deferentially, their faces etched with respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing awkwardly, Natalie felt a frost settle in her heart. &#34;Oliver, I can explain last night. It was a—&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Oliver interjected sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally deigning to acknowledge Natalie, Oliver shot her a withering look, brimming with contempt. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in hearing your explanations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stance was clear: he wanted to consign the events of the previous evening to the annals of history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I&#39;m warning you, even if I don&#39;t fancy you, you must prove your loyalty as my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t betray you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A torrent of angry words surged within Natalie, but she forced them down. Fine, if Oliver refused to listen, she wouldn&#39;t attempt a third explanation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, please have a seat and eat. The food will get cold soon,&#34; Liam said, pulling out a chair for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam was employed by Oliver&#39;s grandmother, Marjorie Windsor. He had watched Oliver grow up and held a unique position in the Windsor family. He alone dared to speak freely in this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie breathed a sigh of relief and shot a grateful look at Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Change the chef. The food is repulsive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, Oliver hurled his spoon back onto the plate, his expression stormy and threatening, as though he had eaten something nasty.</p>
