                <p>Natalie did not expect Oliver to come back in the middle of the night and to be awakened to tend to him. When she came downstairs and saw him, she felt that he was different tonight, but she could not put her fingers on what was different exactly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood at the entrance, leaning against the doorframe lazily. His light brown eyes were bright, surging with intense emotions, and his aura was powerful and domineering without any disguise, just like a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not until Natalie got closer and smelled the overwhelmingly strong scent of alcohol that she realized he had drunk a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you drunk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him, wondering if she should support him or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt slightly dizzy. He blinked slowly as he looked at the woman in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed in a sleeveless watermelon red night gown and a robe, exposing her slender neck and collarbones. Her waist and her arms were slender. There was also a hint of sweet fragrance on her body, tempting people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had not been for his unexpected arrival and summon, Oliver was certain that she would have wrapped herself up tightly before coming to see him. After all, she only married him for money, despised kisses, and was afraid of others knowing about their relationship so she did not wear her wedding ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s gaze darkened as he thought about these things. He leaned against her and rested his arm on her shoulders as he said, “Help me upstairs.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stiffened when he leaned on her. She felt as though he was hugging her. She had not been so close to a man before, and with how unpredictable Oliver was after drinking, she felt a sense of danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, I’ve never taken care of a drunk person before. I have no experience…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Drunk?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had never gotten drunk before in his 25 years of life. He felt he was still incredibly sober. When he felt Natalie trembling, he grasped her chin and moved closer before saying in a low and husky voice, “Natalie, you’re my wife.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened, and her breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have to do your duties as a wife…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s face turned red, and she quickly lowered her head. She really hoped that when he spoke about duties, he was talking about her looking after him, not… the other kind of duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Oliver wanted Natalie to serve him, naturally no one dared to object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam only said, “Young Madam, I’ll have to trouble you to look after Young Master.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt extremely aggrieved. She had not seen him for a few days now, and when she saw him again, he was in a drunken state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was about 6 feet and 4 inches tall, and he was relatively muscular. It was not surprising that it took tremendous effort for Natalie to help him to the room, especially when they were going up the stairs. She felt as though she was carrying a huge rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, can you hear me? I need you to exert some force. You’re too heavy!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at Natalie panting in exhaustion. Even if his eyes were closed earlier, he could sense the rejection. He felt that he had gone crazy. Rosewood Estate was his territory, but he actually let her stay here while he stayed outside. He had been in a terrible mood over the past few days and had slept poorly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was very careful as she climbed up the stairs, worried that she would fall. Alas, fear seemed to have invited misfortune. She let out a sharp cry when she suddenly tripped and fell backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie carefully watched her every step on the stairs, afraid of tripping over herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver opened his piercing eyes in the dim light and reacted quickly. He reached out and grabbed Natalie, pressing her firmly against the railing in just a blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Natalie several seconds to react after narrowly avoiding a disaster. She looked at the stairs with lingering fear. If she had fallen earlier, she would definitely have broken some bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just about to thank Oliver when she thought about how he was pretending to be drunk to make things difficult for her. She looked at him only to discover his eyes were closed as rested his head against her shoulder, close to her neck. She could feel his scorching breath on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver? Hey, Oliver! Wake up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nudged him twice, but there was no response. She muttered to herself, “Hey, are you really drunk? Aren’t you just pretending? Hey?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver listened to Natalie muttering to herself with his eyes closed. Her voice sounded even more soft under the cover of the night. She seemed to have become bolder now that she thought he was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt that perhaps he had drunk a bit too much. For some reason, he found her voice extremely pleasant when she said his name. His hand brushed against her left hand and felt a ring on her ring finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She put her ring back on…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he realized that the corners of his lips were slowly rising, he quickly regained his poker face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really wanted to hear her speak again, but she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, back when they were playing pool, he had already found it extremely pleasant when she said his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie finally carried the ‘giant rock’ back to the room and was about to put him on the bed, she accidentally tripped, falling onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a blink of an eye, the supposedly drunk Oliver grabbed her and caged her beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through her thin nightgown, she could clearly sense the warmth of his body, and she did not dare to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sweet fragrance seemed to overwhelm his senses as his cheek brushed against her smooth skin, which seemed softer than the finest silk. The alcohol seemed to magnify his emotions and impulsiveness. Without a second thought, he snuggled up against her and nuzzled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew that the sober Oliver would not have acted like this. His current puppy-like behavior indicated that he was truly drunk at this moment. She was about to move him away when he suddenly propped himself up with his arms. He stared at her, and a storm seemed to be brewing his light brown eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The string of rationality in Oliver’s mind seemed to snap at this moment as he pulled her soft body into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened in shock. She tried to escape, but it was already too late. Without any hesitation, he held her face and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oli…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled and kicked her legs. Her senses were overwhelmed by the strong presence of the man immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver opened his eyes. He asked hoarsely, “What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t you want to?&#34;</p>
