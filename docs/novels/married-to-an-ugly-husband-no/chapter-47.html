                <p>Seeing that Natalie did not move, two of Mrs. Watson’s trusted servants stepped forward and forcefully dragged Natalie up the stairs before pushing her into a room and locking the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie touched her stinging face and sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, the Watsons did not know that she had to inform Oliver whenever she left Rosewood Estate, just like an elementary school student. If she did not return at night, Liam would definitely send people to look for her. At that time, the responsibility would fall on the Watsons, not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hailey, maybe you should hide as well?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson felt guilty and worried. After all, her daughter was the one who was originally supposed to marry Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mom, there’s no need for that. I’ve already met Oliver at the Windsor’s mansion. He’s Adrian’s uncle,” Hailey said, “Moreover, it’ll only draw suspicion if I hide from him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, as soon as the servant mentioned ‘Mr. Windsor’ earlier, Hailey’s heart had already skipped a beat. When she recalled the domineering, powerful, and arrogant man with a cold and profound gaze, she inexplicably wanted to meet him again even if she knew the mask hid a disfigured face. She not only found such a man tempting, but he even aroused her desire to conquer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have a point,” Mrs. Watson said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, what brings you here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert greeted Oliver with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Watson and Hailey stood next to Robert, smiling as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie married Oliver, as a father-in-law, Robert could not put on the air of an elder in front of Oliver and had to be respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, wearing a silver mask, stepped out of a Pagani Huayra. He quickly scanned the surroundings before he asked, “Where’s Natalie?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie is tired and sleeping in her room. Did you come to pick her up?” Robert responded. He thanked Mrs. Watson inwardly for her quick thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was used to people fawning over him. He ignored Robert and looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert maintained his smile, seemingly unbothered by the slight as he said, “Oliver, Natalie is still asleep. Why don’t you come inside and wait? I’ll have my wife wake Natalie up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver nodded, but a hint of sarcasm could be seen in his eyes. After all, he arrived half an hour after Natalie; he had a hard time she had already gone to sleep in such a short time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mr. Windsor, please have some fruit,” Mrs. Watson said. She looked at Oliver’s imposing figure furtively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Look at his temperament. He truly lives up to his reputation. What a pity… Otherwise, he would’ve been an ideal match for Hailey…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert shot a look at Mrs. Watson, and she understood immediately. She secretly instructed the servants to bring a cold compress and makeup upstairs to do some touch-ups on Natalie’s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey whispered, “Daddy, Oliver is a business prodigy. Didn’t you say that you were uncertain about a project? Why don’t you let him a look since he’s here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was just thinking about this. He nodded and left Hailey to entertain Oliver while he went to retrieve the files from his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, did you know my sister auditioned for RK Media’s car exhibition?” Hailey asked. She picked a grape up and handed it to Oliver before she said, “Please have one.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know about that,” Oliver replied curtly. However, he only glanced at the grape and did not reach out to take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey did not withdraw her hand. Instead, she said with an awkward smile, “As the host, it’s my duty to serve you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered. “Are you worthy?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was furious. She threw the grape into the trash can and tried her best to suppress her humiliation before she said, “Do you know what I saw after my audition at RK Media?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not give Oliver a chance to speak and continued to say, “I saw a man behaving intimately with Natalie. That man seemed to be Isaac’s friend. I advised Natalie to… to be faithful since she’s already married to you. However, she said you’re not worthy of being her husband.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you finished?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver leaned back on the couch. Although his posture was lazy, his aura was still powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why can’t this noisy woman just shut up?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mr. Windsor, aren&#39;t you angry?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is it possible for a man to tolerate a cheating wife?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hailey could say that Natalie was cheating on him, Oliver had already stood up and started walking up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Robert, who was just about to go downstairs saw this, he said anxiously, “Oliver, where are you going? My wife has already gone to wake Natalie up. You can just wait downstairs.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s been ten minutes, and there’s still no response?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert could not help but shiver when he heard Oliver’s icy words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the rooms on the second floor were tightly shut. Oliver took a look and asked Robert, who was standing behind him, “Where’s Natalie’s room?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Uh... Well, she…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert prevaricated, not wanting to answer the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Hailey, who had just come upstairs, gave the answer away as she instinctively glanced at one of the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, Oliver did not hesitate and strode over immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was only about 300 square feet, smaller than the toilet in his bedroom. The furniture was simple; there was a bed, a cupboard, a desk, and a chair. There was no dressing table. Even the servants’ rooms in his house were better than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Mrs. Watson and a few others surrounded Natalie. One of the servants held an ice pack in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why bother with the ice pack? Just cover it up with powder! She’s not that precious,” Mrs. Watson said sarcastically in her shrill voice. Just as she was about to continue, a loud bang rang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had kicked the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Hailey pursed their lips, wondering why Mrs. Watson had to say such words at such a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood at the door. Although he was expressionless, his aura was extremely intimidating. His gaze was chilly as he asked mockingly, “Not that precious? Who are you talking about?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I, I, I…” Mrs. Watson stammered. She was so frightened that she dropped the powder puff in her hand. She felt like she was looking at a demon as she faced Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Natalie was held down by the two middle-aged servants while Mrs. Watson used a lot of force when she applied the powder, causing her to grimace in her pain. In the end, she had to close her eyes to endure the pain. Unexpectedly, after a loud bang, she opened her eyes and saw Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was surprised. She thought Oliver would be fooled and sent away by the Watsons. Unexpectedly, not only was he not fooled, but he also found her in her room while she was being held down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she did not even know why Oliver suddenly showed up here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘It… It can’t possibly be for me, right? Otherwise, he would’ve just come with me earlier…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as she looked at the man standing in front of her again, she began to doubt herself. She could see that his cold gaze behind the silver mask was fixed on her. In them, she saw emotions she could not comprehend, emotions she had never experienced before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the cold and ruthless silver mask, the man&#39;s deep and cold eyes were fixed on her, carrying emotions she had never experienced and couldn&#39;t comprehend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is he… angry?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie opened her mouth to speak, but the sharp pain in her lip and cheek made her wince. In the end, she could only swallow the words on the tip of her tongue.</p>
