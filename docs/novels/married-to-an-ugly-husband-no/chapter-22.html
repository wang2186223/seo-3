                <p>&#34;Take her to the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; the maid replied before she gestured for Natalie to follow. &#34;Madam, this way please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie followed the maid upstairs without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hailey had been staring at Oliver since he shot her. At first, her gaze was filled with fear. However, her curiosity and her desire for conquest gradually won over. For some reason, she started having strong feelings for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, follow me to the study,&#34; Henry huffed in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having no interest in speaking to Henry, Oliver scoffed and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s repeated humiliation made Henry&#39;s face turn red in anger, his chest rising and falling rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adrian, who is that man?&#34; Hailey could not help but ask as she watched Oliver&#39;s tall figure walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man was taller than Adrian and had a more imposing aura. Not to mention that Adrian was wary of him. Before that night, Adrian was the most outstanding man Hailey had seen in her twenty-one years of life. But this man had changed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the Windsor family, Oliver was indeed a rabid dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s Oliver!&#34; Adrian spat. &#34;What a rabid dog!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He...He&#39;s Oliver?!&#39; Hailey covered her mouth in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought, &#39;No wonder he&#39;s wearing a mask. He has been disfigured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;However, he looks quite fit, not frail at all. A fine man like him... If it weren&#39;t for that accident ten years ago, he would definitely be popular!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey still remembered her first encounter with Oliver when she was young. He was remarkable, both in looks and talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought, &#39;What a pity...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was still seething. He grew angrier when he saw the wistful look on Hailey&#39;s face. He asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey quickly reined in her emotions and exclaimed angrily, &#34;Nothing! That man is so arrogant! Who does he think he is, ordering us around? He was just an outcast in the family, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After learning Oliver&#39;s identity, Hailey was irritated by his dominant position in the Windsor family as Adrian was completely overshadowed by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man was...her ex-fiancé!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way that she could remain calm when her former fiancé defeated her current boyfriend with his presence alone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was annoyed, and his patience was running thin. He thought, &#39;What a stupid woman!&#39; Irritated by Hailey&#39;s complaints, he said rudely, &#34;Shut up! Stay away from him. Don&#39;t provoke him. You don&#39;t know what he&#39;s capable of. If he goes after you, no one will be able to save you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was initially puzzled by Adrian&#39;s behavior, but she quickly figured out the reason behind his anger. After all, she knew how to read the room quite well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping her arms around Adrian&#39;s waist, she cooed, &#34;Adrian, I know you&#39;re only putting up with Oliver because he&#39;s your uncle and he&#39;s rather pitiful. Moreover, he&#39;s disfigured, and he won&#39;t live for long. In a year or two, he won&#39;t even deserve to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made Adrian think, &#39;Indeed. Even though the Norton family is powerful. So what? It won&#39;t support Oliver forever. He is disliked by the Windsor family, and the Norton has its own heir. Now, with the powerful Norton family, he acts like he has no fear in the world, but he doesn&#39;t dare to harm the Windsor family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Oliver is bound to be a complete loser!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid led Natalie to a room at the end of the second floor. Looking inside, she was greeted by the familiar Gothic decor reminiscent of the Rosewood Estate. The room faced east, offering excellent lighting and a view of an artificial lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this Oliver&#39;s room?&#34; Natalie stood at the doorway without entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t know how to explain to the maid that she and Oliver were not a real couple and shouldn&#39;t share a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, remembering Oliver&#39;s cruel treatment toward the disobedient Windsors, Natalie didn&#39;t dare to voice any objection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask a question?&#34; Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, please feel free to ask,&#34; the maid replied respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really okay for Oliver to treat Victoria like that?&#34; Natalie questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Windsor, don&#39;t worry. Mr. Oliver will be fine,&#34; the maid reassured with a smile, thinking that she was worried about Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although Mr. Oliver is not favored by Sir Windsor, he is still a proud member of the Windsor family. In old times, he would be the legitimate heir and naturally have a higher status than Ms. Victoria. Sir Windsor cannot dispose of Mr. Oliver at will, as the elders of the family would not agree. Moreover, the Norton family, Mr. Oliver&#39;s mom&#39;s family, is even more powerful than the Windsor family. This isn&#39;t the first time Oliver has taught a Windsor a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A family that was more powerful than the Windsor family? Natalie didn&#39;t remember hearing of a Norton family in the country, so it could only be...a noble family from abroad!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suppressed her doubts and stopped asking any more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles quickly returned to Oliver&#39;s side. Then, he whispered, &#34;Mr. Oliver, I found something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at the servant next to him, and the servant swiftly stepped back. Oliver said, &#34;Continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The woman who used to go around telling people she was going to marry you was indeed not Mrs. Windsor. It was Hailey. She was also your original fiancée,&#34; Charles said. &#34;However, after your accident, Hailey stopped telling people that she was your fiancée. Over the years, people had forgotten which daughter from the Watson family was engaged to you. In the end, they asked Mrs. Windsor to take Hailey&#39;s place to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who had a sound mind would deduce that Hailey obviously was reluctant to marry Oliver after his accident. Therefore, the Watson family married Natalie to Oliver, the bastard daughter that nobody liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles thought, &#39;If Hailey finds out the truth about Mr. Oliver in the future, she&#39;ll regret her decision for the rest of her life.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver narrowed his eyes, a flash of mockery dancing in his gaze. &#34;So they sent me a replacement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Charles replied and asked, &#34;Mr. Oliver, are you gonna punish the Watson family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The refreshing scent of eucalyptus permeated the room. The captive scent was the same as Oliver&#39;s scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was immaculate, but it didn&#39;t look live in. Clearly, it had been empty for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not dare touch Oliver&#39;s belongings. She made her way to the balcony and admired the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you looking at?&#34; A voice came behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie jumped, turned around, and saw Oliver entering the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed in a black, pinstriped shirt today with matching trousers. Standing in the gothic-style room, he was like a hybrid of an angel and a demon from Western legends, a handsome, mysterious, and captivating creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just admiring the view,&#34; Natalie replied and pointed at the table. She added, &#34;Your gun is on the table.&#34; Her eyes widened as Oliver walked toward her instead of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Oliver, he noticed that Natalie subconsciously scooted back with each step he took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame that there was a waist-high railing behind her, so she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver casually sat down on the bed, crossing his long legs leisurely, his hands resting at the sides, exuding a domineering air. He asked, &#34;Are you afraid of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie instinctively shook her head. However, she felt her act seemed fake. So, she nodded and said, &#34;A little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought, &#39;He shot two people without batting an eyelid earlier. Anyone will be afraid of him. &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you feel when you saw your ex-boyfriend?&#34; Oliver asked. It didn&#39;t escape his notice that Natalie&#39;s expression stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Oliver, I...&#34; Natalie trailed off. She licked her lips, unsure of the intention behind his question. After a moment, she said, &#34;I was not aware of Adrian&#39;s background when we were dating. I was also unaware of his relationship with you when I married you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver knew what kind of person Adrian was. Adrian had a long dating history. He started chasing girls very young, and he was just as young when he lost his virginity. All the while, he would pretend to be an upstanding gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver witnessed Adrian&#39;s conversation with Natalie in the garden. He was surprised that Adrian indeed had genuine feelings for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver recalled Adrian&#39;s loving gaze and tone toward Natalie, he felt sick, as if someone was eyeing his possession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, when Natalie saw Oliver&#39;s gloomy expression, she continued to say, &#34;Mr. Oliver, Adrian and I are over. I know my position. Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t do anything that will...bring shame to my current duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt a twinge of discomfort when Natalie implied that being his wife was merely a duty. He asked knowingly, &#34;What is your duty??&#34;</p>
