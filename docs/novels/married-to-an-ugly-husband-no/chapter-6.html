                <p>It was a call from Natalie&#39;s father. With a heavy heart, Natalie answered the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, did you give Oliver the gift I prepared for him?&#34; The voice of Robert Watson, her father, came through the phone. &#34;Remember that you&#39;ve got to behave there. Don&#39;t upset him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sad, Natalie thought, &#39;Father called not out of concern for me, but to tell me not to make Oliver angry.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was even crueler when he forced her to marry on behalf of Hailey. He said, &#34;Natalie, let me tell you something! If you refuse to marry Oliver, I&#39;ll throw you and Lucas out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words destroyed the last bit of hope Natalie had for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give it to him later,&#34; she said, suppressing the disappointment and dull pain. &#34;Dad, please don&#39;t tell Lucas that I&#39;m married. It might be a bit too much for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said angrily, &#34;Too much for him? What&#39;s that supposed to mean? You&#39;re lucky to be Oliver&#39;s wife!&#34; He lost patience soon. &#34;Never mind. No one will tell him if you just do as I say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Natalie was the only one in the family who would go visit Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gift was in Natalie&#39;s suitcase, in a flat box 1.6 feet wide, covered with delicate gold foil kraft paper, looking noble and impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what was inside. With the box in her arms, she went to Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the study was closed. This time, after she knocked, she waited. She didn&#39;t dare to enter at will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the door opened soon. It was controlled by an intelligent system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The study was astonishingly large, seemingly 1,000 square feet, and was mainly in dark brown. The floor was covered with expensive velvet carpets, and the walls were lined with bookshelves packed with rare books in every language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat lazily behind a broad desk made of rare wood, leaning back in a leather office chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning light came in through the glazed window and shone on half his side face. His features were stunning and perfect in the morning light, like those of a deity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found it hard to believe that such a handsome man was actually rumored to be hideously ugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her coldly, his gaze almost questioning her purpose for coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, my dad asked me to bring you a gift,&#34; Natalie said, presenting the box in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver used his slender, powerful fingers to tap the desk casually. &#34;Bring it in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being alone with Oliver in a room would easily be intimidated by his innate domineering aura, and Natalie had to take a breath before stepping inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver glanced at the exquisitely wrapped gift box in front of him and lifted his chin, commanding like an emperor, &#34;Open it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unpacked the box, and inside was an antique gilded saber with smooth lines on the blade, a handle inlaid with rare gems, and a beautifully carved scabbard adorned with elaborate patterns. Anyone at first glance could tell how priceless it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Oliver showed no interest in such an item.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fiddled with it indifferently for a moment, just as he was about to toss it back, he noticed something at the bottom of the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hooked up the few pieces of fabric with two fingers and laughed upon seeing them clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, is this your new way of seducing me?&#34; he sneered coldly and mockingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Natalie frowned in confusion. She didn&#39;t see it clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, he tossed her the fabrics, covering her head accurately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled them off and saw that they were a few pieces of semi-transparent fabric connected by thin strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of leopard-print sexy erotic lingerie often seen in porn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body went numb, and she blushed instantly, feeling that she was about to burn. She tossed away the erotic lingerie immediately and didn&#39;t even dare to glance at it out of the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any man knew the implication when a woman gave him erotic lingerie as a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could there be such a thing in the box...&#34; she stammered in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks and ears were red, and she looked so shy that it seemed she wanted to vanish into thin air right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Oliver sneered, thinking, &#39;Still pretending here., among all those women trying to seduce me, you&#39;re the best at acting.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re bold enough to give it to me, yet you&#39;re too afraid to put it on? Give me a break. Just drop the act.&#34; His mocking voice insulted Natalie even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not...&#34; Natalie felt utterly wronged and took a deep breath to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I never even opened this gift box. How could I possibly... put erotic lingerie inside? I mean it! &#34; Natalie said, helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood up, his towering presence instantly enveloping Natalie, his powerful aura spreading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt like he was a wolf king about to hunt, and she was his defenseless prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she wanted to step back, yet he clutched her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I know what you&#39;re after. You want to put on that sexy lingerie to seduce me, want to sleep with me, isn&#39;t that so?&#34; His voice was deep and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next episode preview: Guess who put the sexy lingerie in the gift box?</p>
