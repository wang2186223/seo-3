                <p>&#34;You’re shameless!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How can a person like him exist?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m also despicable,” Oliver said with a sneer, “Do you want to see it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants, who were waiting outside, had already retreated when they saw that the situation inside was not right. They glanced at Natalie before they left, thinking that she was the first woman who dared to challenge Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie said no, Oliver leaned over and kissed her. His angle and position were perfect for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened in surprise. It took her a second to regain her senses and process the fact that Oliver was kissing her again. However, this time, he was completely sober.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His kiss was fierce and domineering. He only mercifully let her go when she was almost running out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gasped heavily for air, and her limbs felt weak. Her face was also completely red. It was unknown if it was because she was holding her breath or because of Oliver’s shameless action. When she raised her head to glare at him, her eyes were slightly wet with tears, making them even brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver licked his lips. She tasted so sweet that he could not find the words to describe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie finally removed all the tags, Oliver finally agreed to her visiting Lucas. However, she did not expect him to want to come along as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You attend to your business. I can go to the hospital on my own. I don’t want to trouble you,” Natalie said, still trying to dissuade him from coming with her after they entered Rolls-Royce. Naturally, she did not care if he was troubled or not; she just did not want him to come with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored her and focused on the iPad in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, who was sitting next to him, felt vexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, Oliver said, “Call me Oliver.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Huh?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was puzzled, unable to figure out his intentions. She bit her lip, still angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, he only wanted to hear her call his name again. He said with a hint of coaxing, “Natalie…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Natalie looked at him, puzzled. Although she had called him by his name before, she was slightly embarrassed now that he told her to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hurry up…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I… I shouldn’t simply call your name. What if I accidentally expose your identity?” Natalie said, coming up with a convincing reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver nodded, finding some truth in her words. He looked at the sunlight that shone on her face, and he instinctively reached out to touch her cheek. His fingers gently caressed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie froze, and her breathing turned heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It’s fine if you don’t use my name when we’re outside, but you can continue to do so in private… We’re in the car now. There’s no one else around. Come on…&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver suddenly wanted to hear her calling his name again. When it came from her mouth, it carried a hint of sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face flushed red again. She inexplicably felt embarrassed now even though she had called him by his name countless times before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on, say it…” Oliver said patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Natalie called out shyly, “Oliver…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fleeting smile appeared on Oliver’s face immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie could not help but look in front. The driver today was not Charles, but a young man named Jamie. Jamie seemed completely oblivious, but she knew it was just an act, causing her to feel even more embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is he acting so strange lately?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital ward was crowded. Patients on beds were being pushed into rooms by nurses, and there was an endless flow of visitors going in and out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned. It was his first time in a place like this. After all, when he needed to come to the hospital, he was given VIP treatment, and when he was hospitalized, he only stayed in private rooms. He had never had to mingle with so many ‘ordinary people’ before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his handsome appearance, he naturally attracted people’s attention. A few women even kept sneaking glances at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a few people rushed over, almost colliding with Oliver. Seeing this, Natalie quickly pulled him aside. Then, she said, “It’s crowded here, and the ward is even smaller. Why don’t you leave first?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s gaze lingered a few seconds on her hand that holding onto his sleeve. Just like that, the irritation that arose from his noisy and crowded environment inexplicably vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll accompany you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought about it for a moment. After spending so much time with him, she also knew that once he made up his mind, it was difficult for others to change it. She sighed and no longer tried to persuade him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was not just making up an excuse when she said that Lucas’ ward was small; it was really small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson was a wealthy family, but even then, they were unwilling to provide Lucas with a better room. They only provided him with a simple and small room out of obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie knocked on the door, a clear and youthful voice rang from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please come in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice was neither humble nor arrogant, neither fast nor slow; it was polite and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile appeared on Natalie’s face immediately, and she pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lucas!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young boy lay on the bed expressionlessly, but when he saw Natalie, he could not hide his joy at all. He tried to get off the bed, but his movements were hindered by the needle on the back of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hurried over and stopped Lucas, saying, &#34;Don&#39;t move, Lucas! You’re getting older, but you’re still so rash…&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver watched as Natalie skillfully fluffed the pillow for the boy before carefully removing the air bubbles from the IV line and reinserting the needle into the back of the young boy’s hand. Her movements were smooth, as though she had done this many times before. Although she seemed to be chiding him, the gentle smile on her face did not disappear at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Oliver’s second time seeing Natalie so warm and gentle. The first time was in the photo of her and Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver quietly studied the young boy, his brother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was in his prime; he was only 16 years old. However, his hair had fallen off due to chemotherapy. Nonetheless, this did not detract from his good looks. Despite his age, he seemed to possess a maturity that his peers lacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister, you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was just about to act coquettishly with his sister when he finally saw the man who followed his sister into the room. His expression changed immediately, and he asked, “Who is he?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas sized Oliver up. The man was tall and charismatic, and his face was strikingly handsome. Although his suit seemed nondescript, there was no doubt that it was extremely expensive.</p>
