                <p>In short, the man looked perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Natalie&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s heart skipped a beat, and she quickly interjected, “Boss!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Am I crazy or was he really going to say ‘husband’?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression grew colder as he stared at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was not easily fooled. He looked at Oliver and said skeptically, “Boss? I don’t remember seeing him in G Entertainment before.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said nervously, “I’ve terminated my contract with G Entertainment. He’s my new boss.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver placed one hand in his pocket and looked at Natalie, who was standing by the bed, coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘New boss? This woman can really lie!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas still looked skeptical, but before he could ask further, he saw something shiny hanging at Natalie’s neck. He asked, “What’s that? A diamond ring?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown appeared on Lucas’ face, worried that Natalie would be deceived or taken advantage of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow. He wanted to see how this woman would explain the diamond ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was wearing a shirt today. When she bent over earlier, the necklace had fallen out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh… It’s just costume jewelry. I bought it from a boutique! It was very cheap and looked good, so I bought it!” Natalie said. She deliberately lifted it for Lucas to see before she quickly hid it under her shirt again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed softly. Then, he muttered under his breath, “Costume jewelry? Cheap? That’s a custom-made ring by Milan’s top jewelry designer! The diamond itself is worth six figures.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shut up!” Natalie whispered angrily. She glared at him, warning him to not expose her lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt as though he was asking to be angered by coming here. He clearly had a pile of documents waiting for him, and yet, he chose to come here and listen to her call the wedding ring he gave her cheap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that her attitude might anger him, she pleaded pitifully, “Oliver, can you stop talking… please?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver inexplicably felt happy seeing that Natalie had softened her attitude. He glanced around and saw that there were only chairs in the room. The ward was truly small, and it only contained the bare minimum to house a patient. It had a bed, common medical equipment, a small table, and two chairs. There was no private bathroom at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When I saw the ring, I thought Adrian proposed to you. I’ll buy you a real diamond ring in the future,” Lucas said. In fact, he still wanted to look at the diamond ring. Alas, Natalie had already put it away. He could tell that the design and the quality of the ring were not something one could buy cheaply at a boutique, but he kept his doubts to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Lucas’ voice fell, Natalie felt a piercing gaze on her. Although she clearly did not do anything, she somehow felt as though she had just been caught cheating. She quickly explained, “Adrian and I have broken up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Broken up?!&#34; Lucas exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was still thinking of a reason when she heard Lucas say, “It’s good that you broke up with him. I really couldn’t stand him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised, Natalie asked, “Why didn’t you say anything before?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas had always been indifferent to Adrian, but then again, he was indifferent to everyone except Natalie. As such, Natalie did not think much of it. In fact, she assumed he had a rather favorable impression of Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t say anything before because he was your boyfriend, but now the situation is different,” Lucas said without reservations, “Adrian looks down on people. He’s not worthy of you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not know whether to laugh or cry. She asked, “Then who do you think is worthy of me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teenager held hand, behaving like a spoiled child as he said, “I haven’t met anyone worthy of you yet! In any case, you’re still young. You should enjoy the single life for now and settle down at about 27 or 28. You must find a man who loves you and spoils you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie only shook her head helplessly with an indulgent expression on her face. At the same time, she thought to herself, ‘It’s too late for that…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat silently on the chair, and Lucas did not ask about him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Natalie sighed in relief and asked about Lucas’ health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m fine. You don’t have to visit so often. You’re busy, and I don’t want to be a burden to you. I can look after myself. The doctor said that I can be discharged once the indicators stabilize next month.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was unaware that Natalie had to beg her father, Robert, to pay for his medical expenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it often? It’s been almost a month since I last saw you. How can you be a burden?” Natalie said, “What fruit do you want to eat? Shall I peel an apple for you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had brought a fruit basket earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, thanks!” Lucas smiled brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sneered inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s already 16, but he’s still acting cute! How shameless!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie continued chatting with Lucas for a while. Then, she planned to speak to his doctor about his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Will you come with me please?” Natalie asked, wanting to take Oliver, whom she regarded as a huge burden, away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re going to bring your boss to the toilet?” Lucas asked as his eyes darted between Natalie and Oliver inquisitively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned. She had completely forgotten that she had told Lucas she was going to the toilet as an excuse to speak to his doctor. In the end, she said stiffly to Oliver, “Then, uh, you… you can just wait for me here. I’ll come back in a bit.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reassured herself, thinking that Oliver was aloof and taciturn, so there was no need to worry about Oliver and Lucas talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alas, Natalie was completely wrong this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Natalie left the room, Lucas’ expression turned solemn, and he said in a matter-of-fact tone, “You’re not my sister’s boss.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Oliver had no intention of paying attention to the teenager, but his interest was slightly piqued now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you say so?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She spoke very casually to you. She wouldn’t have been so casual if you were her boss.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver crossed his legs, thinking, ‘It seems like those medals in the photo aren’t just for show…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was expressionless and indifferent toward Natalie, so Lucas did not have a good impression of him, despite how outstanding he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you like my sister?” Lucas asked with a frown on his youthful face. At this moment, his cute and sunny demeanor in front of Natalie had completely disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of Natalie, Lucas was like a clingy puppy. In her absence, he was like a wolf cub that was ready to bite anyone who approached.</p>
