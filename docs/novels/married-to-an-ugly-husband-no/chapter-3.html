                <p>Isaac said irritably, &#34;Will you stop cursing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bickered non-stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at them, Oliver smiled while shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt quarreled a lot, and he had long gotten used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the wedding ceremony was over. The wedding car sent Natalie to the Rosewood Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Rosewood Estate was a castle-style estate set on one of the most scenic hills in Paykston.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way into the estate, there were guards who saluted her respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate featured numerous castle-style buildings, a lake, and facilities for leisure and entertainment such as a golf course, a racetrack, and training grounds including a playground and a shooting range...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing but luxurious!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to here, where Oliver lived, the Watson&#39;s place was almost shabby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Mrs. Windsor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie got out of the car, about two dozen servants bowed to her in two rows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way, Mrs. Windsor. I&#39;m the housekeeper here. You may call me Liam,&#34; said Liam Powell, the leading servant, an elderly man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had never been served by so many servants before, and she was a bit uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she noticed that though most of the servants looked very respectful, very few of them smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, many of them didn&#39;t take her, Oliver&#39;s newlywed wife, seriously at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam had arranged for Natalie to stay in the guest bedroom. According to him, it was per Oliver&#39;s instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Oliver&#39;s wife, yet she was asked to live in the guest bedroom. Clearly, Oliver didn&#39;t like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, do you know where Oliver is?&#34; Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;He has left to hang out with his friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled a long face, thinking, &#39;Oliver skipped our wedding to hang out with his friends?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Am I nothing to him? I&#39;m his newlywed wife!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;How insulting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ve heard it said that the uglier a man is, the weirder he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;If that&#39;s true, given how weird he is, I bet he is hideous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Gosh. I weep for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I end up marrying a hideous weirdo! I must be the most miserable woman in the world!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But what can I do besides accept it?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t throw a tantrum. Noticing that, Liam looked at her with a hint of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought, &#39;Any other woman would have been pettish when their husband skipped their wedding and arranged for her to live in the guest bedroom. But she didn&#39;t. That&#39;s impressive.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, could you let me know when Oliver comes back?&#34; Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; he responded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Natalie didn&#39;t get to see Oliver until she woke up the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought, &#39;I went through the wedding alone and spent our wedding night alone. What&#39;s more, I slept in the guest bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I bet I&#39;m the most tragic bride in the world!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Now I know why Hailey has gone all out to have me marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This marriage is nothing but a tragedy! A prison!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the third night when Oliver returned to the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked imperious in a black silk V-neck shirt and black trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; he asked Liam coldly, as Natalie was nowhere to be seen in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, Mrs. Windsor is in the room. Seems she wants to talk to you about something,&#34; Liam said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned, thinking, &#39;Natalie wanna talk to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;About what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She wanna cry in front of me, blaming me for not showing up at our wedding?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care. While going upstairs, he said indifferently, &#34;I&#39;m not going to her. Tell her to come to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Liam went to Natalie and told her Oliver was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon knowing that, Natalie immediately rushed upstairs to the master bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Very nervous, she thought, &#39;What if he&#39;s so ugly that I can&#39;t even face him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What should I do then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But no matter what, I guess I&#39;ve got to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He&#39;s my husband. I can&#39;t stay away from him forever, can I?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hesitating for a moment, she finally plucked up courage and knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she got no response after knocking a few times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that the door was unlocked, she pushed it open and walked into the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering the master bedroom, Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in shock!</p>
