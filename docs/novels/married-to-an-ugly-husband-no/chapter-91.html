                <p>After Oliver replied to an email from Europe, he looked up and saw the delicate woman sleeping on the couch. He could tell that she was exhausted. He had never taken care of a woman before. The only person he had taken care of was Arthur, but Arthur, just like him, hardly needed care, especially when Arthur grew older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only at that moment that he seemed to realize that she had been taking care of him all day. Moreover, she had likely stayed up all night as well during and after his surgery. A rare hint of distress and guilt rose in his heart immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed the needle from the back of his hand. As soon as he got off the bed, he felt a sharp pain in his legs. However, he did not even pause as he endured the pain and walked toward Natalie with the thin blanket he had picked up from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he sat down on the couch, their combined weight caused Natalie’s body to tilt toward him. In just a moment, her head was already resting on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his injured shoulder, he did not feel pain at all at this moment. The distress in his heart grew stronger as he looked at the dark circles around her eyes. He raised his hand and covered her with a blanket before he gently kissed her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was setting at this moment, lighting up the skies with a mixture of colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver quietly watched the peaceful sleeping face of the woman, restraining the desire to touch her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the scene that Rosy May saw when she came in to do a routine check-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy exclaimed in surprise, “Oliver…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Rosy swallowed her remaining words when she saw the look he shot her, clearly asking her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy did not leave immediately. Annoyed, she walked over reluctantly and reminded in a hushed voice, “You need to lie down and rest! Your legs are injured. Also, don’t you know that your shoulder is injured? Right now you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie frowned and murmured something, clearly disturbed from her peaceful slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Oliver said in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He really doesn’t care about his body at all!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy shook her head helplessly. At the same time, she wondered how someone as despicable as Henry could raise two sons, Oliver and Arthur, who were so different from him. The younger brother severed ties with his older brother for a woman while the other brother neglected his health and life for a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy sighed inwardly. ‘This is a recipe for disaster.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie finally opened her eyes, it was already dark outside the window. She remembered that Oliver was still working before he fell asleep, but now he was next to her. With this discovery, she jumped up in surprise, asking, “Why did you get out of bed? Was I… was I resting on you earlier? Why didn’t you wake me up? Did I touch your wound?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie could not hide her concern at all at this moment, and when Oliver saw this, his heart was suffused with warmth. He casually picked up the blanket next to him and covered himself as he said, “I’m hungry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you back to bed before I prepare dinner.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stopped Natalie from helping him and said, “Go prepare dinner.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him, confirming that he was fine. She thought that he was just moody and did not want to see her now. With this, she left to prepare dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unaware that after she left, Rosy and a nurse came immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn’t you feel your wound reopening?&#34; Rosy grumbled as she lifted the thin blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood had already seeped out, staining the blue and white hospital gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Less talk, more action,” Oliver said impatiently. He knew that Natalie usually did not take a long time to cook. He wanted the treatment to be done before she returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy frowned before she instructed the bodyguards who came in to help Oliver back to the bed. Then, she ordered the nurse to assist her as she dealt with his reopened wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your legs need another x-ray. Please stop acting recklessly. Otherwise, your wife is going to think that I’m an incompetent doctor!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the door suddenly swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Windsor, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence rushed in with a Prada bag slung over her shoulder. A worried expression could be seen on her face as she held Oliver’s hand tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at the hand holding his with a gloomy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried that Oliver would lose his temper, Rosy removed Cadence’s hand and said, “Miss, Mr. Windsor is injured. Please let go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the years Rosy knew Oliver, she had only seen him being physically intimate with Natalie. She knew very well what he was like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Oliver asked. His voice was very cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ran into Isaac, and he told me about your condition,&#34; Cadence said before she complained with a pout, “Why didn’t you tell me that you’re injured?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Isaac did not deliberately tell Cadence about it. He had intentionally spilled the beans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After changing into a new hospital gown, Oliver said, “I’m fine. You can leave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to leave!&#34; Cadence said with a pout, “I want to look after you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife will look after me,&#34; Oliver said impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Natalie entered the room, holding a tray in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, do we have a guest?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence frowned. After a beat, she said, “It’s you again?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, at Starry Hotel, Natalie did not get a good look at Cadence due to how dark the room was. As such, she looked at the glamorous young woman and asked, “Excuse me, you are…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t recognize me? We&#39;ve met before!&#34; Cadence said indignantly. She felt that Natalie was deliberately provoking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Do I have to recognize you? Moreover, you didn’t even say where we met…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head earnestly, indicating that she really did not recognize Cadence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy held back her laughter, amused that Natalie was able to rile the arrogant Cadence up. She said, “Mrs. Windsor, this is Candace Aura.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Rosy turned to Cadence and said, “Cadence, this is Mr. Windsor’s wife.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Miss Cadence,&#34; Natalie politely greeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence scoffed in disdain. At this time, she saw Oliver staring at Natalie, and her anger surged immediately. She noticed the food tray in Natalie’s hands, and without another thought, she knocked it straight to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wooden tray clattered to the ground loudly, and the ceramic plates shattered immediately.</p>
