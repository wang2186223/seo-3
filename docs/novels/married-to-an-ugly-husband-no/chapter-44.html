                <p>It was already past dinner time. Natalie knew it would be time for supper by the time she was done cooking. Considering how late it was, she decided to make soup because it was light and easier on the stomach. However, worried that Oliver might not find it filling, she added mushrooms, vegetables, and seafood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie was done, it was almost nine. She went upstairs and knocked on Oliver’s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver opened the door quickly. He had just taken a shower, and he was dressed in a loose black robe that was not properly tied. It seemed like he had dressed in a rush. His face was pale, and his brows were furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie noticed his slightly hunched back and the hand on his abdomen before she asked, “Do you have a stomachache?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get to the point, Natalie,” Oliver said, leaning against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I made supper for you. Will you come downstairs and eat?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not hungry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was in a bad mood, and he did not have the appetite to eat at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey, wait!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Oliver was about to close the door, she quickly held the door and said, “It’s not good to skip meals. Don’t compromise your health just because you’re angry, okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you begging me?” Oliver asked coldly. It was as though he would not eat unless Natalie said yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, yes, yes, I’m begging you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Fine, just do whatever you want. After all, I still owe you a favor for saving me back then!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought that if she could improve Oliver’s health a little bit, it could be considered as repaying his kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Will you eat?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver finally nodded. His expression clearly said, ‘Since you’re begging me, I’ll be magnanimous.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was filled with the rich aroma of the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although there was only one kind of food on the table, it managed to around Oliver’s appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seafood used was the finest, filled with nutrients and satisfyingly chewy. The soup was flavorful with a tangy and sweet taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was angered by Natalie multiple times today, but the delicious food seemed to have swept the anger in his heart away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s have another bowl,” Natalie said as she scooped another bowl of soup for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tomatoes and basil in the soup made the soup extremely delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sat next to Oliver and watched him eat with expectant eyes. She asked, “Is it delicious? This is my recent creation.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She seems to care what people think of her cooking…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver remained silent. When he saw her untouched bowl, he said, “Eat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she did not receive feedback, Natalie pouted as she picked up her spoon and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soup was delicious. Its texture was perfect, and the ingredients used blended harmoniously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soup was hot, and a cloud of mist rose, obscuring Natalie’s face when she ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked up and watched as Natalie ate earnestly. Her expression was serious as she ate, giving the illusion of gentleness and tranquility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That’s right. It’s just an illusion…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was aware of his nominal wife’s personality. She was docile and timid in front of him, but she was like a fierce beast with sharp claws outside. When she stepped on the runway, she shone brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She’s clearly not a pushover. So why did she marry me in Hailey’s place?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver smiled slightly. Regardless of her reason, as long as she did not make him unhappy and did not cross his boundaries, he would give her the dignity of the title Mrs. Windsor and even spoil her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s head was lowered as she drank the soup. Suddenly, a spoon appeared in her field of vision, and a piece of seafood fell into her bowl. Seeing that Oliver gave her a piece of seafood, she asked, puzzled, “What are you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression, which had just cleared up, darkened again. After half a second, he only said, “Eat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt that there must be a reason behind Oliver’s action. She looked at Oliver cautiously and remembered she had not had any seafood yet. She asked, “Oliver, do you think I put something in your food?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What nonsense does this woman have in her mind?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Eat!” Oliver said through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at the seafood in her bowl. When she realized that he had not used the serving spoon earlier, she wondered inwardly, ‘Does this count as an… indirect kiss?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you disdain the food I gave you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver slammed the spoon down with a loud bang as his temper flared up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing that the atmosphere was not right, the surrounding servants quickly lowered their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie held her breath for a moment. She quickly shook her head before she ate the piece of seafood that Oliver had given her, showing him that she did not mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, Oliver seemed appeased. He even occasionally gave more food to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Natalie ate the seafood and vegetables that kept piling up in her bowl expressionlessly. However, her ears were red as she thought to herself, ‘Doesn’t he know that feeding someone like that is an intimate act? Did he take the wrong medication today?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling stuffed, Natalie finally said, “Oliver, I’m full.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver paused. He looked at the half-eaten food and said disdainfully, “Even a cat eats more than you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Then go and find a cat that can eat so much!’ Natalie rolled her eyes inwardly as she took a deep breath to calm down. She was too lazy to argue with him again. Moreover, she was too full now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie received a message from a project manager from RK Media, notifying her that she had gotten the position of the main model in Scene B.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The autumn car exhibition was divided into two segments. The first segment, known as Scene A, showcased nine cars, which included globally renowned concept cars. International models were hired for Scene A.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Scene B was slightly inferior to Scene A, it showcased expensive luxury cars, with the highlight being an expensive Hummer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt that the main model for Scene B would attract significant attention from insiders. Previously, only top-tier domestic models were hired for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was extremely excited and quickly called Jane to share the good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Congratulations! You’re finally on the path to becoming a top supermodel!” Jane said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Although I’m happy, I’m a little worried that I only got this because of my connection with Isaac, not because of of my ability,“ Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You only had a game of pool together. He’s not going to give you special treatment because of that,” Jane said, “Moreover, I’ve always told you that you’re talented. Your talents are not inferior to those of top models. You only lack opportunities.”</p>
