                <p>Natalie saw a text message from an unfamiliar number: [Hey sister-in-law, it&#39;s Isaac. Hehe!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie passed the car show interview, Isaac became her boss, so she immediately sat up in bed: [Issac, hello.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: [Sister-in-law, Charles said Oliver brought you a gift all the way from London. What did he bring for you? Give us a taste of the good stuff?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was purely curious. Since he couldn&#39;t get an answer from Oliver, he happened to have nothing to do tonight, so he came to ask Natalie. After all, her contact information was in the company system and easy to obtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Natalie suddenly remembered that Oliver seemed to have lost something when he came back, and the sound of it being thrown was quite loud. She didn&#39;t pay attention to it at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie got out of bed, casually put on a coat, and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants had already gone to rest, and it was silent. The first-floor foyer was only dimly lit by a corner lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned on her phone&#39;s flashlight and slowly searched for something that could be the &#34;gift&#34; Isaac mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light was too dim, making it difficult to see the path, let alone find something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had searched for two hours without any success, but she couldn&#39;t just throw away the valuable things Oliver had brought back from London, despite being upset with him. She had no choice but to continue searching, albeit with patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already three in the morning when Natalie finally spotted a brown paper bag with an embossed vintage pattern, just outside the window. Inside was a similarly designed square flat gift box, not small in size, measuring ten inches, with the surface now dampened by the night dew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Oliver returned from his morning exercise, and the outer guards hurriedly approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master, it seems Miss was in the backyard last night and didn&#39;t return to her room until half-past three. We went there later to check, but found nothing,&#34; the guard&#39;s emphasis was on safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s expression turned cold, &#34;Half-past three?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She stayed up until the middle of the night, and you didn&#39;t bother to see why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she is Lady...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know how to inform me?&#34; Oliver glared at the few people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We were afraid to disturb you while you were sleeping. You&#39;ve always had trouble sleeping, so how could we dare to call you? Anyone who disturbs your sleep is asking for trouble.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost!&#34; Oliver&#39;s temper was never good, and now it was even worse in the early morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head guard nodded repeatedly, about to leave when he heard his boss say, &#34;From now on, anything related to Natalie must be reported to me immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, Oliver didn&#39;t see Natalie during his morning exercise. It was already half-past six, and she still hadn&#39;t come down. It wasn&#39;t until seven o&#39;clock that the woman appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor... good morning,&#34; Natalie was still embarrassed to see him because of what happened yesterday, but now, seeing Oliver so early in the morning, her eyes held hostility instead of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have bags under your eyes that could touch the ground,&#34; Oliver looked at her weary face, with slightly swollen eyelids indicating lack of sleep, &#34;Did you find gold in the backyard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t mention the lingering kiss from yesterday afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had only slept for two to three hours, and now her mind wasn&#39;t very clear. After a while, she reacted, &#34;You know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was soft and tender, with a hint of innocence, something she would never do when her mind was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Oliver was filled with anger, there was also a part of him trying to calm the raging fire. With his molars clenched, he wondered what to do with this restless and foolish woman who always managed to make him angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never listened!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t start behaving, he would throw her out like an abandoned cat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, is this yours?&#34; Just as he was thinking this way, the woman suddenly spoke, holding out a delicate gold-patterned box in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here is the gift box.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a jewelry box that he brought back from the auction house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t mention that kiss, and Natalie wouldn&#39;t either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, it might not have been a kiss, but a punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stayed up all night looking for this thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver now found the jewelry box displeasing. If he hadn&#39;t brought it back, she wouldn&#39;t have stayed up like a fool in the middle of the night searching for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, take it back.&#34; Natalie ignored his foul attitude. After yesterday, she didn&#39;t dare to be reckless anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her obedient appearance made Oliver even more angry. He stared at her for a while before saying, &#34;Open it and take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gift box opened, revealing a luxurious necklace with a translucent black gemstone as its centerpiece. The entire chain was made of uniform-sized pearls, which were round and soft in texture and could be regarded as top-quality. The entire design exuded an air of nobility that went beyond the phrase &#34;priceless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; Oliver could already imagine how beautiful the necklace would look on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her neck was slender, her skin fair, and her collarbone delicate. This necklace was the perfect fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a glance and shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver seemed to have not heard her words and arrogantly said, &#34;Put it on and let me see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, I don&#39;t like it. Take it back, please.&#34; Natalie made her point clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woman, do you want me to throw you out?&#34; Oliver&#39;s face was even more sour now. She actually dared to keep saying she didn&#39;t like the gift he gave!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was firm. &#34;Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Windsor, but I really don&#39;t want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; Oliver smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode towards the entrance, lifting the hand holding the necklace box high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s body reacted faster than her mind. She ran over and hugged his arm. &#34;Hey! What are you doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you say you don&#39;t want it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, I searched for this all night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that have to do with me? It&#39;s mine, and I can do whatever I want with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s implicit meaning was: If you don&#39;t want it, I&#39;ll throw it away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want it!&#34; Natalie compromised. She couldn&#39;t do anything about him. &#34;I&#39;ll accept it then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her heart, she cursed this stubborn and cunning man a hundred times, afraid that he would actually smash this expensive piece of jewelry on the ground. She didn&#39;t notice that the man&#39;s body had stiffened for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had a stunned expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s words echoed in his ears: &#34;I want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two words were more suitable for the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s gaze briefly passed over her rosy lips, vividly recalling their soft and sweet texture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put it on, let me see,&#34; Oliver snapped out of his trance, his voice unusually low and strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie touched the necklace with her fingertips, genuinely liking its classical elegance more than the diamond necklaces in the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her arm backward but couldn&#39;t find the clasp, looking at him with a pitiful expression. &#34;Mr. Windsor, I can&#39;t put it on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clumsy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver walked over and took the necklace from her, his hands clasping the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As an antique piece, this necklace couldn&#39;t be worn like modern ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver quickly managed to secure it, and as his fingertips brushed against Natalie&#39;s delicate neck, he paused for a moment, the touch as smooth as the finest ivory jade.</p>
