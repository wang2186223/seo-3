                <p>In fact, Natalie’s French was good. Her accent was also authentic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many people said that French was the most romantic language in the world, and Oliver did not think much of it until today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought that he had never heard anyone speak French so gently before. Her voice sounded melodious, turning the dry content of the document into poetry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie paused and said, “Uh, I don’t recognize this word…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver took a look and read the word aloud. It was not a very common word, so he was not surprised that she did not know the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at him in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He sounds so good when he speaks French!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long did you learn French?&#34; Oliver asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; Natalie thought for a moment before she replied, &#34;I became interested in it during middle school and taught myself on and off for about three years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was quite talented and was quite successful at learning the language on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver felt a strange sense of pride that even he did not notice. He continued to ask, “What other languages do you know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s about it,” Natalie said vaguely, lying. She knew some Russian and Spanish, but her knowledge was only superficial. She was not proficient enough to show off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she looked at Oliver curiously and asked, “What languages do you know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he had once stunned the nation with his talents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Japanese, Russian, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and French,&#34; Oliver said. Seeing the admiration and awe on her face, he continued, “Danish, Swedish, Sanskrit, and a few others, but I’m not very fluent…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘His skills are terrifying!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had always been praised by her teachers and classmates for her intelligence. She also ranked first in her class multiple times despite missing her classes. However, she really could not compare to the man in front of her at all. She felt as though she had been overwhelmingly defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not help but mutter under her breath, “Ah, I shouldn’t have asked you that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s lips curled up slightly. He had received countless praises in the past, but he rarely felt this proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, you need to rest more,” Natalie said, changing the topic and hinting that he should stop working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was a workaholic, after all. He naturally did not listen to her. He only gestured at the couch with his chin and said, “Sit over there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pursed her lips, thinking he found her naggy. Since she had nothing to do for now, she took a seat on the couch. As soon as she sat down, a wave of fatigue washed over her immediately. Huddled by Oliver’s bed the previous night, she managed to rest for a few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back and looked at the man on the bed as sunlight streamed into the room, casting a golden glow on the man’s perfect face. She carefully studied his face, thinking that he was truly handsome. He looked even more charming when he was focused on his work. She did not think many women would be able to remain unmoved when they saw his face. With this face, once his true identity was revealed, many women would definitely go mad for him. At that time, when he grew tired of her, it would be her cue to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyelids grew heavier and heavier, and it did not take long before she fell into a deep sleep.</p>
