                <p>In the VIP parking space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several luxury cars were parked there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver got into a silver Bugatti and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac asked, puzzled, “Wyatt, what’s going on? Why did Oliver leave so abruptly?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt adjusted his glasses and looked at Isaac as though he was an idiot and said, “It’s because he ‘s turned on…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes widened. “What the hell?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Oliver’s desire was stirred up after Natalie kissed his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove extremely quickly, as though he was using the excitement from the high speed to dilute his desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loosened his tie with one hand, feeling irritated that he could not control his emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the club, Jane remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jane, what are you thinking about?” Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m thinking about that guy, Oliver,” Jane thought about it for a moment before she said, “Isaac is from the renowned Black family; he’s in charge of the entertainment division of RK Group. As for Wyatt, he’s the CEO of DT Technology. DT and RK Group have a cooperative relationship. The two of them are rather important figures, but they seem to hold Oliver in high regard. However, I’ve never heard of someone like Oliver among the young elites I know.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought that it was better if she kept Oliver’s identity from Jane. It was Oliver’s secret after all. Most importantly, nothing good would come out of knowing the secret of someone like Oliver. Who knew what he would do to make sure his secret remained a secret?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was late summer, and the summer night still carried the heat from the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed as she walked into Rosewood Estate, wondering how she should explain the changes in the relationships between her, Oliver, Adrian, and Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about Oliver, she could not figure out why his behavior tonight was so strange. It seemed like he did not reject her as much as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Madam, you’re back!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam’s voice pulled her back to her senses, and she discovered that she had already entered the house. She smiled and greeted, “Hello, Liam.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam nodded with a smile before he said, “Madam, Young Master is waiting for you inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Oliver came back so quickly? Don’t tell me he wants to settle accounts with me?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath before she walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver sat on the spacious couch alone. He had already changed into his casual home attire. Although the light gray pants he wore were loose, they still could not hide the fact that he had muscular legs. He did not need to speak at all, and just sitting there quietly, he was already extremely eye-catching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver,” Natalie said conscientiously, “I didn’t tell Jane about your secret.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What secret?” Oliver raised an eyebrow, wondering which of his dark secrets Natalie was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I… I…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled to put her thoughts into words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hmm?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver put his iPad aside and looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“T-that… That you’re not ugly as rumored and that you’re actually really handsome. Also, you’re not actually without power; you’re actually very capable and successful…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was momentarily stunned. He did not expect Natalie to say this. After she finished speaking, he saw that her ears had turned red and she did not even dare to look at him. A thought suddenly appeared in his mind, and he asked, “Woman, are you praising me? Are you indirectly confessing to me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes inwardly, but she said, “Yes, yes, I was praising you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you being perfunctory with me?” Oliver asked, slightly annoyed. He moved closer to her and held her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was forced to look, but she did not dare to meet his eyes. She quickly looked down, only for her gaze to land on his Adam’s apple, which was bobbing slightly. With this, the scene from the club earlier flashed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Similarly, when Oliver noticed where her gaze was, he could not but recall the earlier scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t go to places like that next time,” Oliver said before he suddenly let her go and turned away. He could still remember the soft feeling of her lips on his Adam’s apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s a clubhouse. It’s not like I went to a nightclub,” Natalie said, “Moreover, I only went there to play pool.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If I said you’re not allowed to go, then you’re not allowed to go,” Oliver said domineeringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Fine.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had to attend the audition for the car campaign today, so she woke up early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver heard the sound of footsteps before he caught a glimpse of the figure coming down the stairs from the corners of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wore a light blue chiffon blouse today, and a pair of white pants covered her long and slender legs. She applied a light layer of makeup on her face, making her delicate features look even more eye-catching. Her long hair was pulled up into a high ponytail. She carried a light brown shoulder bag over her shoulder, exuding a youthful and gentle charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good morning, Oliver,” Natalie said. Then, she remembered that she had yet to tell him that she was going out today, so she added, “I… I, uh, have an audition today.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What audition?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Didn’t you hear it when Jane spoke about it Isaac when we’re at the clubhouse? It’s the audition for RK…” Natalie replied before she asked cautiously, “Is that okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her expectant gaze coldly and scoffed. Then, he said, “Let’s go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Natalie finally realized that Oliver was already dressed in an expensive black pinstripe suit, ready to go out. He looked extremely domineering. She asked, surprised, “Are you… going out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pursed her lips when she saw him looking at her with a look that seemed to ask her what right she had to ask about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get in the car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver tilted his head slightly, gesturing toward the Maybach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Huh? Isn’t Liam going to arrange a car for me like before?’ Natalie wondered inwardly. If she had a choice, she really did not want to ride in the same car as Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the Maybach&#39;s interior space was spacious, it couldn&#39;t alleviate the suffocating dominance of Oliver.&#34;</p>
