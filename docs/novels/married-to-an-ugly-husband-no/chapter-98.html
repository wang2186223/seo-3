                <p>Olive felt as though he had just chewed wax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it delicious?&#34; Cadence asked with twinkling eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver took a bit of the salmon, and his expression turned extremely gloomy. After a moment, he asked, “Did you make all these?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence replied shyly, “Yes. However, I don’t cook often, so I’m not sure if they’re to your taste…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her words, Cadence was very confident. She had been practicing for three days, and the top chef also praised her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No wonder it tastes so horrible.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver dropped his fork and knife loudly on the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence&#39;s face turned pale immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where’s Natalie? Call her here,” Oliver said with a dark expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie walked aimlessly in the garden, trying to ignore Cadence’s earlier words. She did not walk for very long before a servant rushed over, informing her that Oliver was angry. When she arrived in the dining room, she could feel the tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you trying to starve me?” Oliver asked angrily. He was in a bad mood because he ate the garbage that Cadence made, but he was in an even worse mood because Natalie allowed Cadence into the house to cook for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Miss Cadence cook for you?&#34; Natalie asked, feeling like she did nothing wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to eat what you cook!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Can this kind of garbage even be considered food?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was in a bad mood as well. However, considering his injuries, she could only suppress her frustrations and go to the kitchen to cook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears of grievance had already welled up in Cadence’s eyes at this moment. Oliver’s words were like a slap to her face. She said pitifully, “How could say such a thing? You… You allowed me into Rosewood Estate, so why are you treating me like this?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>’When did I allow her into Rosewood Estate? I thought Natalie let her in?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver temporarily put this matter aside and said to Cadence, “I’ve already told you that I don’t like you. Don’t waste your time on me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Feelings can be slowly cultivated. You allowed me to come to Rosewood Estate, so why are you treating me like this?” Cadence asked tearfully before she continued to say, “Weren’t you forced to marry Natalie? She only won because of an agreement! I refuse to accept this. Oliver, I’ve liked you for six years! I started liking you since I was 16 years old! I won’t give up so easily!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Cadence was too emotional, she directly addressed Oliver by his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was not moved at all. He no longer wanted to waste time with Cadence and said impatiently, “Liam, see her off.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence felt extremely unwilling and resentful, but she knew she had no choice but to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Liam returned after seeing Cadence off, he saw that Oliver was still extremely displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who let her in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Master, it was Old Madam&#39;s idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam coughed awkwardly before he said, “She said that Miss Cadence might help improve your relationship with the Young Madam.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Improve my foot!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was speechless. He really did not understand how the old woman on the other side of the world could still meddle in his affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie returned ten minutes later with a plate of spaghetti Carbonara in hand. It looked extremely simple. With just a glance, one could tell that she did not put in much effort at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Liam could tell that Natalie had deliberately done this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver crossed his arms and asked, “Are you trying to anger me on purpose?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other servants trembled slightly when they heard Oliver’s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked away and said, “Of course not. I’m sorry my cooking is not as good as Miss Cadence’s sumptuous spread…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the fake nonchalance on her face, Oliver’s frustrations seemed to vanish immediately. He reached out and pulled her closer to him. She quickly braced herself, placing her hands on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breaths intertwined. From this angle, she could see his long and thick eyelashes and his eyes that swirled with emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, are you jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! What nonsense are you talking about?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was shocked. She had never experienced jealousy before in her life. How could she feel jealous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked at her, amused, as he stroked her hand, “No? Why are you so defensive?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about” Natalie denied. Although she did feel uncomfortable, she definitely was not jealous of Cadence. Who in their right mind would feel happy with Cadence’s attitude? Moreover, even animals were territorial, let alone her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Oliver had seen Natalie like that. He thought she was very cute, making it hard for him to stay angry. He knew that she did not mean what she said and that she was just shy now. With this knowledge, the simple plate of spaghetti in front of him suddenly looked extremely appetizing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver released Natalie and began to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Natalie did not put a lot of effort into cooking, it was still delicious. The texture of the spaghetti was just nice, and the savory taste of the bacon and the richness of the egg yolk complemented each other perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘As expected, with her skills, she can turn even the simplest dish into a delicious meal…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence, the proud young miss, returned home in tears after suffering a setback in Rosewood Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had liked Oliver for many years, so she could not bear to blame him. Instead, she blamed Natalie and directed all her anger at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘It’s her fault that Oliver treats me so coldly now!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura was heartbroken when he saw his beloved daughter crying so badly. In the end, he decided to call Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I heard you’re injured?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The concerned voice of a middle-aged man came through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, who was sitting in his wheelchair, replied, “Hmm.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura did not beat around the bush and said, “My daughter came home crying after visiting you! She said she was humiliated by a woman in your house. This is the first time I’ve seen her so sad. Based on your relationship with our family, I feel that you should promptly resolve all the misunderstandings between you and Candace. If there’s anyone causing trouble between the two of you, don’t you think they should be dealt with immediately?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Mr. Aura’s opinion, Oliver was a good match for his daughter. Previously, he did not say anything because he respected Oliver’s past agreement with the Watson family. However, when he learned that Oliver only married the illegitimate daughter of the Watson family, he changed his mind immediately. After all, how could an illegitimate daughter compare to his precious daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Mr. Aura&#39;s mind, Oliver should marry his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Aura,&#34; Oliver looked at the wedding ring on his finger as he said, sounding extremely bored, “Are you trying to tell me what to do?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, of course not!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Mr. Aura saw himself as an elder, he still did not dare to act recklessly in front of Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed and said, “Mr. Aura, there are two things you need to understand. First, that ‘anyone’ you mentioned is my wife. You should address her as Mrs. Windsor. Second, I’ve never once said that I’d marry your daughter.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did you say?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura was extremely anxious when he heard this. This was completely unexpected. The Aura family had been helping Oliver, but Oliver did not intend to marry his daughter at all. He could not accept this. If his daughter married Oliver, not only would it benefit the family, but his daughter genuinely liked Oliver as well. In his mind, they were a match made in heaven and the marriage was a win-win situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Aura tried to persuade Oliver, saying, “You and Cadence grew up together, and your relationship was also quite good. Isn’t it the best situation if our two families are joined together by marriage?”</p>
