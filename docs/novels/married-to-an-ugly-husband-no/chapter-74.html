                <p>Oliver took a cold shower to calm down. He did not know if he was angry because Natalie did not take him seriously or if he was angry at himself for losing control. He really hated that he had lost control earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he emerged from the bathroom in his bathrobe, his footsteps halted. He narrowed his eyes when he saw the empty bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lit a cigarette and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, blowing out smoke from his sensual lips. His handsome face had an ethereal quality to it when shrouded in the smoke. Suddenly, he heard three quick knocks on the door followed by the sound of footsteps hurrying away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened the door, he saw a glass of water on the carpet, but there was no one outside. He stared at the glass of water expressionlessly with the cigarette in his mouth as he thought to himself, ‘Who in this house would dare to bring just a glass of water apart from that woman?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around and closed the door. As he passed by the bedside table, he saw a man’s platinum wedding ring on the table. It was his, but he had never worn it once. He picked it up absentmindedly and played with it, recalling that Natalie always wore hers on her ring finger. The diamond ring looked good on her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the image of Natalie rejecting him earlier flashed in his mind, and his temper flared up again. He tossed the wedding ring angrily into the drawer and slammed it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, after lying in bed for about ten minutes, he flipped over and angrily put on the wedding ring on his left ring finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning to the guest room that she previously stayed in, Natalie looked at herself in the mirror. When she saw her lips that were kissed swollen, she could not help but curse, “Oliver, you bast*rd!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not sleep well that night. When she closed her eyes, all she could see was Oliver’s face and his demanding gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, she still managed to wake up early the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she walked out of her room, she discovered that the glass of water was sitting untouched in front of Oliver’s room. She bit her lip and walked over, intending to secretly bring it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without any warning, the door suddenly opened when Natalie crouched down to pick up the glass of water. She looked up instinctively and saw Oliver dressed in a sleek designer suit. His expression was dark as though someone had owed him a lot of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, who woke up on the wrong side of the bed, frowned and looked down at her, asking, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly stood up and replied, “I’m bringing it away.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did you bring it for me?” Oliver asked as his eyes flashed briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I saw it here, so I thought I’d bring it away. I don’t know who brought it here,&#34; Natalie denied immediately, feigning an honest expression on her face. After all, he did not drink it all last night, and she was too embarrassed to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver strode toward Natalie, she took a step back. He quickly trapped her between him and the birch railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I slept in the guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew that Oliver already knew where she was last night, so there was no point in lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver massaged his temples; his head was aching from a hangover. His gaze suddenly landed on a bluish mark on her chin. He raised his hand and touched it, asking, “What’s on your chin?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that it was a bruise, Oliver subconsciously clenched his hands. He thought to himself, ‘Did I do this to you last night?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, seeing that Oliver did not say anything else, Natalie hurried away with the glass of water in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver arrived at the dining room, he did not see Natalie, but there was a sumptuous spread on the table. They looked as good as though from a five-star restaurant. Clearly, Natalie did not make them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Natalie?&#34; Oliver asked, no longer referring to her as ‘young madam.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam replied, “She said she wasn’t hungry and went out for a morning run.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She’s clearly avoiding me…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver put down the cutlery he had just picked up and said, “Call her back to make breakfast for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was called back before she even started running. Earlier, when she came downstairs, she noticed that the chef had already prepared breakfast because she woke up a little later than usual. Hence, she simply left to avoid him. Although she was still angry about last night, she was more afraid of him. After all, his temper was unpredictable, and she wanted to avoid angering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, she saw Oliver calmly looking through documents in the dining room. The sumptuous breakfast spread had been taken away, leaving the table empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Oliver got drunk last night, she knew he must have a hangover. As such, she prepared food that would help with a hangover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, Oliver’s appetite was aroused by the food Natalie cooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How does it taste?” Natalie asked eagerly. She did not seem to be as timid when it came to food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After chewing and swallowing his food, Oliver replied, “It’s average.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scolded inwardly, ‘It’s average, but you still finished everything?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Oliver’s mood eased slightly. He decided to tease Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Liam, who put the glass of water outside my room last night?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Natalie, who was still marveling over how much Oliver could eat, looked up in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam smiled and replied, “Young Master, it was Young Madam who personally brought the glass of water for you.”</p>
