                <p>&#34;Hailey, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Adrian asked, almost shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Adrian, don’t misunderstand. I wasn’t trying to take off the ring. I promised to marry you after all, and I’ll wear it for the rest of my life. Please don’t be angry,” Hailey said forcing a smile on her face as she tried to remain calm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not talking about that! What happened with the car?” Adrian asked, practically yelling. When he thought about how he had wrongly accused Natalie and defended Hailey earlier, he felt like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I… I really don’t know,” Hailey said, shaking her head as her eyes darted around, “Perhaps I accidentally scratched it when I walked past it earlier…. Oh, wait, I tripped earlier because of my high heels! I must have intentionally scratched the car at that time!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The green paint on the ring was undeniable proof, and Hailey could no longer deny it. She knew that she had to admit that she scratched the car. However, she absolutely could not admit to framing Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, as a professional model, your actions are really unprofessional,” Natalie said nonchalantly, “Moreover, when people trip, they usually support themselves with their palms. Your diamond ring…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie paused before she gestured with her hands, as though she was recreating the scene. Then, she continued to say, “The only way the green paint could have gotten on your ring was if you had deliberately scratched it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you&#39;re twisting the truth!&#34; Hailey protested, face red with anger and embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian had had enough of this farce. After all, as the young master of the Harrington family, how could he be involved in such a ridiculous scene in front of so many people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handle it yourself!&#34; Adrian said as he glared at Hailey. Then, he left without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian’s attitude clearly expressed that he believed Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone with a brain could also tell that Hailey had intentionally set Natalie up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s expression was extremely ugly. She did not even change her clothes before she chased after Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person in charge felt extremely embarrassed. Since Isaac and Oliver, the two important figures, did not give any further instructions, he quickly told the models to change their clothes and go to Starry Hotel to for the celebration dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip. She knew it was not appropriate to talk to Isaac and Oliver now, so she only nodded at them before she went to change her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie left, Isaac and Oliver walked away as well. As they walked away, Oliver glanced at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac immediately understood Oliver’s meaning and sent an email to the HR Department. The person in charge of the autumn car exhibition might have just gotten a huge bonus, but he was about to be demoted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once two important figures left, the remaining people began to discuss fervently among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rich people are so interesting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it that that man looked so attractive when he was smashing the car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the relationship between that handsome guy and Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he really Natalie&#39;s sugar daddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt it. That man barely even spoke to Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie left the venue, Jane was waiting outside for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane was stunningly beautiful with an aloof temperament. When Natalie walked towards her, she happened to see a man approaching Jane, trying to strike up a conversation. Jane, however, gave him a cold and disdainful look, and he walked away dejectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Always so beautiful and attracting attention wherever you go,” Natalie said teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why did you take so long to come out?” Jane asked as she reached out to hug Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie recounted what happened inside the venue, Jane rolled her eyes and said, “Hailey and Adrian are really shameless! Fortunately, you’ve broken up with him!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad I saw his true colors early on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane looked at Natalie seriously before she asked, “Natalie, are you familiar with Mr. Windsor?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We just played pool once. Weren’t you there as well?” Natalie said, feeling a bit guilty. She pretended to check her messages, unable to look at Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rarely lied, so Jane did not suspect anything. Since there were not many people around, she asked the question that had been lingering in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So what’s happening with you and Oliver?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was amused by the nosy expression on Jane’s face. She said, “I’ll just let things take their course. Right now, my priority is to earn enough money to pay for Lucas’ treatment.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she had to become famous in order to make money. With enough fame, her fee would also rise. Those international supermodels earn hundreds of thousands per show at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, like I said before, I can give you that money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your brother?&#34; Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane opened her mouth, but no words came out. However, her gaze was cold. If it was not for her recklessness, the Watkins would not be in such a state. but couldn&#39;t say anything, her eyes filled with a sense of coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the Watkins family fell overnight, some people died, and some people ended up in prison. Jane did not have many feelings for the others, but her brother was different. He fell into a coma and had to be sent out of the country for treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Similar to Lucas, Natalie knew Jane’s brother’s treatment also required a lot of money. How could she bear to borrow money from Jane? Moreover, there was no end to Lucas’ treatment. The only cure was a bone marrow transplant, but finding a matching donor was a one-in-a-million chance. Even if she found a matching donor, who knew if the other party was willing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jane was still the young miss of the Watkins family, Natalie would not have hesitated to accept Jane’s help. However, now, the money should only be used by Jane. It was her brother’s lifeline after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright. Let’s not talk about this anymore. Trust me. I’ll be able to earn enough money for Lucas soon.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Jane still looked a little down, Natalie tried to distract her by saying, “Jane, in fact, Oliver and I get along quite well. Although his temper is bad, he’s not bad as the rumors say.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s helped me and even saved me… At the very least, he’s better than Adrian.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane said, suddenly changing the topic, ‘Actually, I thought that Windsor was really nice to you today. Perhaps he bought all those cars because of you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane was in the crowd earlier, and she had seen Oliver. The man was arrogant and seemed to disdain everyone. However, his gaze lingered on Natalie several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jane! He couldn’t have bought 31 Hummers because of me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although 200 million meant nothing to Oliver, Natalie did not think he would spend that kind of money on her. However, she thought that perhaps the 32nd Hummer, the one he had encouraged her to smash, was for her. Perhaps he was really helping her to vent her anger.</p>
