                <p>With Cory Clayton’s prestige and position, there was no need for him to consider Hailey’s background at all. The Watson family was simply not enough to suppress him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the audition for the 19th group ended, Oliver got up and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, where are you going?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stood up and quickly followed Oliver</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the audition room, the way the two models looked at Natalie was completely different from before. They were now trying to get close to her and spoke very politely to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cory was famous in the industry for having a very keen eye. The models that he had taken notice of were now among the top domestic models. Some of them were even international models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah glared at the duo fiercely and said, “Get lost!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The duo did not dare to offend Noah and quickly left with their tails between their legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah looked at Natalie murderously as she said, “Natalie, don’t be too proud just because Cory praised you. If you’re so good, why would you still be unknown after a year? You were just lucky earlier.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had stolen all the limelight earlier, and Cory did not even spare a glance at Noah. It was as though she was invisible. How could Noah not be furious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t you wish you were as lucky as I was then?” Natalie retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey hid her jealousy due to Noah’s presence. She said, “Natalie, does the company know that you participated in the audition? If you participated without the company’s knowledge, you’d be punished. Have you forgotten? I advise you not to mess around.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie picked up her clothes and said nonchalantly, “Don’t you know? I’ve already terminated my contract with G Entertainment.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?” Hailey stared at Natalie in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smiled faintly and said, “I terminated my contract with G Entertainment a week ago. So, from now on, you can’t step on me while you try to climb up the ladder.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How is that possible?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that she had lost her composure, Hailey quickly suppressed her anger before she turned to Noah and said, “Noah, I have to speak with Natalie privately. Can you change first while we talk?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah obeyed Hailey’s words like a loyal minion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When only Natalie and Hailey were left, Hailey tore off her fake disguise and asked fiercely, “Where did you get the money to pay the penalty fee? Did that ugly Oliver pay the fee for you?”In the corner, there was only Natalie and Hailey left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That&#39;s not important. What’s important is that I’m no longer with G Entertainment. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Sienna,” Natalie said. She felt happy just thinking about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, you have to withdraw from this car campaign. Don’t forget, your brother still needs the support of the Watson family,” Hailey said. She was now panicking at the thought of Natalie snatching her position as the main model in Scene B.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was Natalie’s weakness, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s expression turned cold immediately. She grabbed Hailey’s collar and said threateningly, “Let me warn you, Hailey. If anything happens to Lucas, I’ll tell Oliver that the person who was supposed to marry him was you. I’ll tell him you despise his appearance and his lack of power in the Windsor family, so you forced me to marry him on your behalf!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie leaned closer to Hailey and continued to threaten, “Guess what will happen if Oliver finds out about this humiliation? Do you think he’ll hesitate to put a bullet through your head?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie spoke, she pointed at Hailey’s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey turned pale immediately. The horrifying sensation of the bullet whizzing past her legs was still fresh in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That masked man… is really capable of such madness…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie no longer wanted to see Hailey. She brought her clothes with her and made her way to the changing rooms where Noah had gone.</p>
