                <p>Oliver removed his silver mask, revealing his outrageously handsome face that could make an angel jealous. He asked, “Does it hurt?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yeah.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded. It was not too painful in the beginning because of the numbness. However, the pain was starting to kick in, and speaking also became difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver scoffed. “I told you to hit him back, but you were a coward. Serves you right!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Forget it. It’s not like I don’t know about his bad temper…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she sincerely expressed her gratitude, saying, “Oliver, thank you for today. Oh, by the way, what brings you here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver started the engine before he looked at her, as though he was asking, ‘It&#39;s none of your business.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pursed her lips. In the end, she thought it would be wise to remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he asked darkly, “If I didn’t come, would you have let them continue to bully you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Only I can bully her…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does this mean he really came to the Watson family’s house for me?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange emotion appeared briefly in Natalie’s heart, but it disappeared before she could understand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her response, he asked again, “Who’s Lucas?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s my younger brother. He’s sick, so he’s staying in the hospital,” Natalie explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watsons had not publicly announced the existence of its young master, so few people knew about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘An illegitimate daughter and a sickly younger brother… No wonder she’s not favored and was bullied…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was about to step on the accelerator when he noticed the woman next to him struggling to fasten her seatbelt. He leaned over, trapping her between himself and the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was startled and quickly shrank back. She asked him anxiously, “Oliver, what are you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he fastened the seatbelt for her, a rare hint of teasing appeared in his eyes as he asked, “What did you think I was going to do?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did I think you were going to do? I thought you were going to open the door and push me out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Natalie had seen plenty of TV series and novels where the male lead would kiss the female lead or flirt with the female lead under these circumstances. However, whether it was kissing or flirting, she did not think they applied to Oliver. Even if he wanted to do such things, she did not think he would choose her. She had always been self-aware. Moreover, she had no interest in love now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents, Adrian, Hailey, and even Flora taught her a lesson. She did not want to let those people make her doubt her love; she wanted to believe in love. However, she was frightened and no longer wanted to risk her heart. It was the safest for her to keep her heart to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid quickly brought a first-aid kit and a cool compress. When she saw Natalie was about to do it herself, she quickly said, “Madam, let me do it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid organized everything carefully and worked meticulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a mirror, Natalie could not see the condition of her face. The ice pack was pressed against her face, and it felt comfortable. She did not find it too cold, and it alleviated the heat from the swelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid was very careful, and Natalie did not feel any pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought that the maid’s skills were very good. Not only that, but she was very beautiful as well. She had almond-shaped eyes and a pleasant temperament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Madam, you’re too polite. This is my duty,” the maid replied as she changed the ice pack for Natalie.</p>
