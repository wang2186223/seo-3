                <p>Natalie did not dare to look up as she wiped Oliver’s body. She could clearly feel his burning gaze on her. She worked quickly, wanting to get this over it was as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was finally done, she stood up, ready to leave. However, Oliver suddenly held her hand. She instinctively looked up at him, and when she saw the meaningful look in his light brown eyes, she blushed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached up and held her chin as he said teasingly, “Natalie, you’re blushing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“L-let’s… Let’s not do this now…” Natalie said, not knowing where to look. She was so embarrassed she wished the ground would swallow her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re my wife. Moreover, you’ve already done it before…” Oliver coaxed in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, the drawn-out ‘clean-up’ was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hurried into the bathroom, washing her hands frantically. She was slightly panicked and confused at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she came into this marriage thinking that it would only be a marriage in name. She tried to distance herself from Oliver and her identity as Mrs. Windsor. She had already accepted the reality of only being a trophy wife. However, Oliver’s recent behavior and words seemed to indicate that he took their relationship seriously, bringing their relationship on the right track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie spent a long time in the bathroom, hiding from Oliver. She showered, washed her hair, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and even blew dry her hair. When she was done, about one and a half hours had passed. She only came out when there was nothing else left for her to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had just sat on the edge of the bed when Oliver asked her, “Why are you wearing so many layers? Take your robe off…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?” Natalie asked warily. After all, he did not make such demands before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow and asked, “Do you want me to help you take it off?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘If he helps, things are definitely going to escalate!‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood up, intending to remove her robe in the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Oliver said, “Just do it here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘This pervert!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was helpless against the domineering man. In the end, she could only turn away reluctantly and quickly remove her robe. Following that, she hurriedly jumped into bed, hiding under the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was stunned by how swift her series of movements were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie found it difficult to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since they returned from the hospital, Oliver had demanded they share one blanket. He would hug her every night, treating her like a human pillow. She was still unaccustomed to it, especially tonight because she was without her robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Wasn’t he unhappy when he thought I was seducing him before? I thought he was unwilling to have too much contact with me? Why did this man, who used to consider me trash, change so greatly?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A relaxing fragrance permeated the room. Although Natalie was nervous, she could not resist the hypnotic effect of the fragrance and quickly fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the contrary, Oliver was wide awake. Even a regular sleeping pill would have no effect on him at this moment, let alone a relaxing fragrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the person in her arm who was sleeping with a peaceful and gentle expression on her face. Her presence seemed to dispel the infinite loneliness of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking care of Oliver for another two days, Natalie made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, where can I learn how to shoot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked up from his documents, surprised. After all, she did not look like she would be interested in such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie explained, “I just want to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances in the future. I don’t want to be powerless if a situation like that day happens again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you doing it for me?” Oliver asked in slight disbelief. At the same time, a hint of warmth surged in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I promised to be good to you and treat you well,” Natalie said as she thought to herself, ‘… until you decide to divorce me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt that whenever he said these words, things never turned out well for her. Previously, he had kissed her after saying that. She walked over and stopped a few steps away before she looked at him vigilantly and asked, “What’s the matter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come a little closer,” Oliver said, setting the documents aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath with emotions swirling in her hazel eyes. Before she could react, the man had already hooked his long arms around her waist. Her surroundings spun for a moment before she was firmly caught in his arms. When she looked up, his face was already approaching her. In the next moment, she felt the familiar feeling of being kissed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘When did this cold man become so passionate?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie could only lean against Oliver, unable to resist his advances. In the end, he only released her when she was almost out of breath. She gasped for air for a long time before she finally managed to muster up some strength and asked, “W-why have you been kissing me so often lately?”</p>
