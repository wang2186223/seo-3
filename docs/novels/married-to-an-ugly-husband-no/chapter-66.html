                <p>Adrian immediately shifted all the blame to Natalie, standing up for Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac could not help but roll his eyes at Adrian. At the same time, he noticed Oliver looking at Adrian coldly and mockingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie laughed. “Hailey, did I explicitly say that it was you? Why are you eager to assume that it was you? Also, Adrian, shouldn’t you understand the situation first before you speak?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew the evidence in her hand was not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey pretended to play the victim again, saying, “Adrian, look at how speaks to me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Adrian did not respond to Hailey. Instead, he said magnanimously, “Natalie, I won’t pursue the matter today, and I’ll cover the cost of repairing the car for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Oliver, who had been silent all this time, laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laugh sent shivers down everyone’s spines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian looked at Oliver. He had noticed Oliver as soon as he arrived. After all, with such an outstanding appearance and temperament, it was difficult not to notice Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood with one hand in his pocket. He was taller than Adrian. Just by standing, he already made Adrian look inferior. At this time, he looked at Natalie and said domineeringly, “You, come here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched in silence. They could tell Oliver was not someone to be messed with, and they wondered if Natalie was about to get in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie walked over, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver grabbed a hammer from the tool rack near him and handed it to Natalie before he said, “Take this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie accepted it, bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Oliver gestured at the Hummer with his chin and said, “Go and smash it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at Oliver as though he was crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was the only calm one. He said, “Natalie, if he tells you to smash it, then smash it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire place was silent. No one dared to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hammer was not light. Natalie closed her eyes and swung her arm, hitting the hammer on the hood of the Hummer. However, the car was of such good quality that there was only a small dent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone’s ears, the sound of Natalie smashing the Hummer was the sound of money being thrown away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian frowned. He could not hold back any longer and asked unhappily, “Mr. Windsor, what exactly are you trying to do?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver ignored Adrian and moved to stand behind Natalie. Then, he held her hand holding the hammer before he guided her and brought the hammer down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two people’s arms were tightly pressed together, complementing each other perfectly. The man was extremely handsome, and the woman was extremely beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three loud bangs rang out consecutively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt that her hand had gone numb from the force of the recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was much stronger than Natalie. With his help, he managed to deal considerable damage to the hood of the Hummers with just three strikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Windsor, are you deliberately making things difficult for me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian’s eyelids twitched. After all, fixing the car now would cost much more than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver raised an eyebrow and sneered. “Who are you for me to make things difficult for you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver was about to withdraw his hand, he noticed that Natalie’s arm had lost its strength. He took the hammer from her and quickly threw it to the side. Then, he said casually, “Since I told her to smash it, I’ll naturally take responsibility for the car.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, the person in charge said, looking somewhat embarrassed, “Adrian, in fact, this gentleman said that he was going to buy this car before you arrived.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian could no longer hide his frustrations. He felt that the other party was deliberately targeting him. He said mockingly, “You’re going to buy a broken car?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes,” Oliver said arrogantly as he raised his chin. Then, he looked at Natalie before he continued, “I bought it for her to vent.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was annoyed by Oliver’s previous actions, but Oliver’s words now filled him with a sense of betrayal and anger. He questioned, “Natalie, are you really having an affair with him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood next to Oliver and said, “I’m not your girlfriend, Adrian. It’s none of your business whether I’m having an affair or not. You should just take care of Hailey.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had watched enough of the show, and he was getting hungry. Hence, he said, “Alright, that’s enough.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, Isaac continued to say, “Adrian, Hailey, why is it that every time I see you, you’re bullying Natalie? I really don’t know what ulterior motives you have…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ulterior motives could I have?!&#34; Adrian quickly glanced at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How would I know what goes on in your mind?” Isaac retorted with a shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“In any case, I was wrong for jumping to conclusions earlier,” Adrian said. He knew that he had to take a step back now. After all, it was true that he had ulterior motives and still had hopes for Natalie. However, he could not say anything more in front of Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright, alright, this matter is over,” the person in charge said, trying to end the matter as soon as possible before it escalated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clicked his tongue, wondering why the company put such an inept fool in charge of the autumn car exhibition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey was dissatisfied with the outcome. She looked at Natalie and pretended to advise, “Natalie, be careful during work from now on. After all, you may not be so lucky next time to have this gentleman clean up your mess for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>”I didn’t scratch the car,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Natalie was going to let the matter go. After all, Isaac had spoken. He was responsible for the car exhibition, and she did not want to make things more troublesome. However, she did not expect Hailey to add fuel to the fire again at this moment. If she remained silent now, people would assume that it was her fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hailey, may I ask what’s the green mark on your ring?” Natalie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s face paled immediately when she realized that she had worn her ring while she scratched the car earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike everyone, Oliver’s focus was on a different matter when he heard Natalie’s words. He looked at Natalie’s unadorned fingers, and his expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No wonder something felt different when I held her hands earlier…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This… I…” Hailey stammered, panicking. She instinctively moved to remove her diamond ring, but she froze when she saw Adrian looking at her in shock.</p>
