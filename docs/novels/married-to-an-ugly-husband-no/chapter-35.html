                <p>“Oliver, are you passing by RK Media? If it’s not on the way, I can just take another car,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had already opened up the laptop on his lap at this time. The light from the laptop illuminated his face, making his features more distinct. Upon hearing her words, he stopped what he was doing and glanced at her, asking, “You don’t want to ride with me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Oliver found out that her previous actions might not have been to attract his attention, he would be inexplicably irritated and angry when she tried to maintain a distance from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What a disobedient pet!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had yet to figure out how to respond when she heard him say in an icy and ruthless voice, “If you don’t want to, then get lost! You can walk there!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could have walked down the mountain, she would not have sat in a car with him. In the end, she bit her lip, cursing the bad-tempered man a hundred times in her heart as she got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, you can just stop the car on the side of the road there. I’ll walk over. Thank you,” Natalie said as she pointed at the road near the building of RK Media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked over. The distance between the place she pointed and RK Media was just a few hundred yards. Moreover, based on the way she was looking around outside, he could tell what she was thinking. His gaze was cold as he said mockingly, “What? Are you embarrassed to be seen in my car?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, no, I just feel like I’ve troubled you enough for sending me here,” Natalie said. At the same time, she complained inwardly, ‘If someone sees me getting out of a luxury, they might think I’m some wealthy man’s mistress.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not believe her nonsense. He told the driver to stop the car and said, issuing an eviction notice, “Get out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie got out of the car and looked at the building that was over half a mile away, biting her lip in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘That man definitely left me so far away on purpose!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie arrived, there were already many people there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People stood in groups of two or three, chatting. Some looked confident, and some looked nervous and worried, seeking reassurance and comfort from their companions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I heard only thirty people will be selected out of more than 200 applicants! The competition is super fierce!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone laughed. “An unknown model like me probably doesn’t stand a chance at all. In any case, I only came to RK to see Isaac. I heard he’s one of the interviewers today. They say he’s even more handsome than in photos. His appearance is that of a refined gentleman!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Speaking of which, no one seems to have seen RK’s CEO before. No one knows what he looks like. Some say he’s a balding middle-aged man while some say he’s even more handsome than Isaac.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie heard the words ‘CEO of RK’, Oliver’s face suddenly appeared in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘It can’t be, right? Oliver is so young. If he’s really the brain behind RK Group, then he’s really too terrifying…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie continued to listen to the conversation absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The young miss from the Watson family is here today as well. She’s quite famous in the modeling industry. The main model for the B segment will definitely be her. Not only that, but the second miss of the Harrington family is also here!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Paykston, the Harrington family was among the top ten families. Noah, the second miss of the Harrington family, was anything but low-profile. She was a social media influencer, frequently flaunting her wealth for everyone to see. She could be considered a small Internet celebrity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Hailey, Noah…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned, irritated when she heard the mention of those two people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah was Adrian’s sister, and since the moment Natalie and Noah met, they had not gotten along very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah was spoiled and arrogant. In the past, Natalie tolerated Noah for Adrian’s sake. However, now that things had ended between her and Adrian, she would not spare any patience for Noah if Noah provoked her today!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Isaac parked his car, he saw a familiar Maybach pulling into the VIP parking space. The string of sixes on the number plate confirmed the identity of the owner of the car immediately. He walked over to have a look and confirmed that it was indeed Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, why are you here?” Isaac asked, pleasantly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver held a cigarette between his fingers, and the smoke from the cigarette obscured his handsome face. He asked, “There’s an audition for the car campaign today?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac perked up immediately. He asked, “Did you come because you knows Natalie is auditioning today? No wonder you weren’t interested in the models I introduced you! As it turns out, you already have someone you like! I have to say, if you hadn’t taken a liking to her, I would’ve been tempted to pursue her myself… I, uh…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stopped speaking abruptly when he realized the temperature in the surroundings had dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s expression was also extremely icy at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac asked tentatively, “Oliver, are you… upset?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No,” Oliver said. He got out of the car and put out his cigarette before he closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac scratched his head, wondering inwardly, ‘Was it my imagination then?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knew how rare it was for Oliver to be interested in a woman. Hence, he quickly sent a message to the audition team, telling them that the models would have to wear only their bras and underwear for the audition. Perhaps he would be able to stimulate Oliver on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie heard about the requirement, she froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Underwear will be provided in the fitting room, and we’ll have to be in our bras and underwear during the interview?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s expression changed slightly. If she had known about this beforehand, she might have… No, she still would have come. After all, she needed the money, and RK’s car campaign was extremely prestigious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audition team also prepared black robes for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After changing, Natalie came out of the dressing room. She did not expect to meet the two people she least wanted to see so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Noah saw Natalie, she said disdainfully, “Hailey, that despicable woman is here as well. I really don’t understand how a talentless person like her passed the first round of audition…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Noah were classmates in high school. In the past, Natalie was the school beauty, and Noah could not stand the woman whom she felt stole her spotlight. What was even more infuriating to her was that Natalie even got together with her brother! In her opinion, it was fortunate that her brother had seen Natalie’s true colors now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Noah, don’t talk like that,” Hailey said, pretending to persuade Noah. Then, she looked at Natalie and said with a smile, “Natalie, you’re here too.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the models in the surroundings looked at Natalie curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, some people had already noticed Natalie earlier. After all, she was stunning, and her delicate bone structure was captivating. Even among a group of models, she was very eye-catching. They thought that she was a formidable competitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s Miss Watson and Miss Noah, right?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone looked at Natalie and asked in a low voice, “Who is she? How does she know Miss Watson and Miss Noah?”</p>
