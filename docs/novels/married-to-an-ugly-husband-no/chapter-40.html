                <p>Oliver’s expression did not change as he thought to himself, ‘Seven rounds? We haven’t even gone one round yet…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, Oliver did not say this to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie came out after changing her clothes, Oliver and Isaac were still outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac spoke first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, we’ve already met early on. Why didn’t you say anything?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had very high emotional intelligence. He was skilled at livening up the atmosphere and maintaining relationships. He was often able to befriend strangers in a short time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at Oliver, who was holding a cigarette between his fingers and ignoring the two of them. After a moment, she replied, “Isaac, Oliver and I are just married in name. We…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s enough.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver interjected, cutting Natalie off. He smoked the cigarette a final time before he flicked the cigarette butt into the trash can. Then, he walked away with a cold expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was confused, unsure of what she had to anger him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why does he always get angry for seemingly no reason?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced at Natalie before he hurried after Oliver, wondering what else she was going to say earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘They’re only married in name? I can’t guess what’s happening, so I might as well stop guessing.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was used to Oliver’s predictable mood swings. He asked, “Oliver, didn&#39;t you say you were going to wait for Natalie?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver continued to walk. He did not seem like he cared about the woman he left behind as he said, “When I did I say I was going to wait for her?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac thought about it for a moment. After they came out of the men’s bathroom, Oliver had leaned against the wall with no intention of leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘We’ll, you didn’t say it, but you sure acted like it… In any case, something fishy is definitely going on…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not know what had happened between Oliver and Natalie in the past or what their current relationship status was. However, he knew that his initial assumption had been wrong; Oliver definitely did not see Natalie as just a trophy wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one exit from here, so Natalie could only follow Oliver and Isaac, keeping a few feet away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie heard a familiar voice calling out to her, she wanted to ignore it. However, worried that Oliver would stir up trouble, she could only stop and deal with Hailey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey had changed back into her Chanel dress, looking very elegant. She said, “Natalie, where are you going? Adrian is picking me up. We can give you a ride.“</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s current gentle and graceful appearance was a stark contrast to her ferocity when she yelled at Natalie half an hour ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah rolled her eyes. “Hailey, this woman has impure intentions toward my brother. Why do you bother with her? Only someone as kind as you would be worried about someone like her!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie knew Hailey only said those words to show off her affection with Adrian. She said with a smile, “Hailey, have you apologized to Adrian for causing trouble at the Windsor mansion? Has Adrian forgiven you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s expression turned unsightly immediately when Natalie touched her sore spot. After that incident, she had to coax Adrian for a long time before he forgave her after all. She had to make up all sorts of excuses and shift the blame. Fortunately, Adrian was simple-minded; he was easily satisfied as long as she took care of his needs. When she was done with him, he had gone back to criticizing Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve already resolved my issues with Adrian, so you don’t have to worry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh,” Natalie replied dismissively, looking bored, before she added, “In any case, I don’t need a ride. I’m going back to Rosewood Estate after all. I’m afraid your car won’t be able to enter.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is she looking down on me?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey gritted her teeth in anger before she said, “By the way, Noah, do you know she’s married to Oliver?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah’s eyes lit up immediately, and she said gloatingly, “You married Oliver? Why are you so proud about when you married a disfigured man? Look at your clothes. How shabby!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What&#39;s wrong with being proud of my husband?” Natalie asked before she said with the air of an elder, “By the way, you should address me as ‘Aunt’.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who do you think you are? Why should I address you as ‘Aunt’?” Noah said angrily before she suddenly fell silent as her gaze landed on someone. With that, a joyful and surprised expression appeared on her face immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s heart skipped a beat. She turned around stiffly and saw Oliver and Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘They haven’t left? Does this mean they heard what I said? Did Oliver hear me say that thing about me being proud of my husband?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood nearby with his hands in his pocket. He looked cold and arrogant, clearly not bothered by what Noah had said about him. He had heard countless comments in the past, and they did not bother him at all. He only felt that those people were fools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile could be seen on Isaac’s handsome face as he thought, ‘These ignorant clowns…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, seeing the indifferent expression on Oliver’s face, she thought that perhaps they did not overhear the conversation after all. It would be great if that was the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, when Noah reacted, she ran over in her high heels, looking thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isaac! What are you doing here? Weren’t you supposed to be present during the audition? I didn’t see you earlier. When did you arrive?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was famous in their circle. He came from a prestigious family, and he held a high position in RK Group. Not only was he talented, but he was also good-looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As such, it was not surprising that Noah admired Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced at the idiot who ran up to him and asked, “Excuse me, miss, do I know you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don&#39;t recognize me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah’s smile froze for a moment. However, she quickly recovered and said gently, “It’s me, Noah. We met last month at a charity event. Do you remember?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not have any impression of Noah at all. After all, Noah looked ordinary, not particularly beautiful. However, he had heard of her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, so you’re Oliver’s niece. Sorry, I had no impression of you,” Isaac said bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey walked over and said with a gentle smile, “Isaac, it’s an honor to meet you. I’m Hailey. I wonder if you remember an insignificant person like me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had a great influence in both the fashion and entertainment industry, and many people wanted to establish a good relationship with him, and Hailey was no exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac deliberately looked at Natalie as he said, “Of course, I remember you, Miss Watson. You’re Natalie’s sister.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey&#39;s smile stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does Isaac know Natalie?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Isaac, do you know my sister?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, we know each other,” Isaac replied. At the same time, he glanced at Oliver and thought to himself, ‘Not only that, but I think we’re only going to be closer in the future.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Hailey took the opportunity and ask about Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And who’s this gentleman?”</p>
