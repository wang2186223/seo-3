                <p>&#34;Natalie, you’ll attend Adrian and my engagement party early next month, right?” Hailey asked coyly before she continued to say, “Adrian promised to give the most lavish engagement party, so the preparation time is a bit longer. Look, this is the engagement ring he got me. It’s designed by a designer from Milan whom I really like!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey extended her left hand, revealing a dazzling seven-carat diamond ring on her ring finger. The design and the quality of the diamond were top-notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, compared to Natalie’s wedding ring, it was not worth mentioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah raised her chin and smirked as she said disdainfully, &#34;Hailey, Natalie likes my brother. How can she have the heart to attend your engagement party with my brother? Moreover, what if she cries at the party? That’d be such a downer!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the other models began to congratulate Hailey. During the audition, they had already heard about the juicy gossip; Hailey and Adrian were madly in love while Natalie was abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hailey, you’re so lucky!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Hailey! I wish you and Adrian a hundred years of happiness in advance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, one of the models said, “Natalie, your name is Natalie, right? To be honest, it’s one thing to get your way by sleeping with the judges, but being a third party in someone else’s relationship is just going too far. You should leave the couple alone. Don’t embarrass yourself.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, the others began to chime in one after another, criticizing Natalie with words as such as swords.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Hailey and Adrian are about to get engaged. You shouldn’t harbor any delusions.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the models laughed. “Previously, during the audition, you said that you weren’t interested in Adrian. As it turns out, it’s just a case of sour grapes!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Natalie felt like these people were mentally ill. Why did they all think she was in love with Adrian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, a cold and domineering female voice suddenly said, “What sour grapes? Who said that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Based on the tone of that voice alone, one could sense the superior air of the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing the voice, Natalie called out delightedly, “Jane!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane wore a long and fitted black dress today with a pair of Grecian high heels. Her height of 1.7 meters was not outstanding among the female modes, but her aura was extraordinary, just like a queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the model who had spoken earlier did not dare to speak again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane, what are you doing here? I thought we were meeting tonight?” Natalie asked. She had made plans to have dinner with Jane after the car exhibition was over. She also planned to explain more about her marriage later and apologize for not saying anything until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’m not going to let your ex-boyfriend’s sister and current girlfriend bully you,” Jane said as she held Natalie’s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey’s face turned pale, and she stood up immediately, saying, “Jane, please watch your words!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was in the midst of drawing Hailey’s eyebrows, and the sudden movement caused the eyebrow pencil to slip down to Hailey’s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey yelped in pain before she turned to glare at Vivian fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian scoffed inwardly at how two-faced Hailey was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane’s beautiful eyes swept past everyone as she twirled a strand of hair. Then, she said with a smile, “Did I say something wrong? When your boyfriend was pursuing Natalie in Sense Academy, everyone knew about it. Just ask around, and you’ll be able to find out the truth.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane clapped her hands twice as she continued to say, “The truth is that Miss Watson is the third party, but she has the audacity to insult others.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, someone could not help but burst into laughter before quickly covering their mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, people began to whisper about Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this woman? She dares to insult the young miss of the Watson family…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, someone said, “I heard from a friend in Sense Academy that the young master of the Harrington family was pursuing the academy’s top beauty. Could it have been Adrian and Natalie?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah lost her temper. She pointed at Jane and scolded furiously, “Jane, what nonsense are you spouting? My brother was just bewitched by that vixen, Natalie, at that time! Do you think you’re still the young miss of the Watkins family from three years ago? You’re nothing but a poor woman who has lost everything! How dare you insult our Harrington family! You better shut your mouth!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had always had a good temper, and she was not like her fiery and stubborn best friend, Jane. In the past, among the three friends, Flora was aloof, and Jane was feisty; as such, Natalie was the easiest to get along with. She usually did not pay attention when others insulted her. However, insulting her and insulting her best friend were two different matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a loud smack echoed in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stared at Natalie, the cause of the noise, in shock. They could not believe that she had just slapped someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said to Noah, “Apologize to Jane now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Noah!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailey rushed to Noah’s side immediately, saying, “Oh, no! It’s swelling up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after that, Hailey discreetly sent a text message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Noah finally reacted, screaming, “How dare you hit me, you little sl*t!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah raised her hand, intending to return the slap. However, just as her hand was about to strike, Jane stopped her, saying, “You should be glad that Natalie acted first. If I had been the one to slap you, you’d be lying on the ground right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, realization finally dawned on the others after they heard Noah’s earlier words.eard Noah’s earlier words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So she’s Jane!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can’t believe I met Jane!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Jane was a top socialite in Paykston. Apart from beauty and family background, she was also outstanding in other aspects, rivaling men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, a man appeared at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Noah saw the man, she ran toward the man and held the man’s arm as she complained like a brat, “Brother! You’re finally here! Natalie and that witch, Jane, bullied me! Natalie even slapped me! Look at my face, it hurts! Mom and Dad have never hit me before, but Natalie actually dared to hit me! Brother, you must do something about this!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With such a huge commotion, it was not surprising that everyone in the room had stopped working and were quietly watching the drama unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane stepped forward, shielding Natalie behind her. Then, she waved at Adrian as she said nonchalantly, “Long time no see, Adrian.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian looked at his sister’s face. The handprint on her face was very obvious, and her face was already showing signs of swelling. His sister had always been spoiled at home; how could she have been hit before? To think that Natalie actually hit his sister today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, Noah is my sister. How can you resort to violence? Couldn’t you have talked it out properly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you… Are you taking out your anger on Noah because of me? Apologize to Noah, and I’ll let this matter go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian did not know why he had a hard time getting angry with Natalie. Even after she hit his sister, he could not get angry at her at all. Moreover, he felt a hint of happiness when he thought about how she might have hit his sister because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Adrian, I think I’ve already made it clear that I’m not interested in you,” Natalie said as she wondered inwardly, ‘Why didn’t I realize how shameless this man was before?’</p>
