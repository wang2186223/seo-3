                <p>&#34;What on earth did you cook? Don’t you know Windsor is very picky about his food?” Cadence said contemptuously, “Natalie, right? Let me tell you, Windsor won’t eat such cheap food. Stop wasting your time and effort!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cadence!&#34; Rosy said reproachfully with an unfriendly expression on her face. She had never liked Candace, but as an adult, she had maintained civility. However, Candace had really crossed the line this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Oliver placed the pillow to the side and stared at Natalie silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath, glanced at Candace for a few seconds, suppressed her anger, and prepared to crouch down to clean up the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Oliver was not angry and that Natalie did not dare to say anything, Cadence became even more audacious. She said, “I’ll look after Windsor from now on. You better leave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Natalie suddenly hissed in pain when she felt a sharp pain on her fingertip, and she quickly withdrew her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, who was on the bed, rushed over immediately. He pulled her up and held her hand, looking at the cut on her index finger with a frown on his face. Then, he pointed at the door and said to Cadence, “You, get out now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cadence pointed at herself with an expression of disbelief. “Me? Are you confused? She should leave, not me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie finally regained her composure after being startled by Oliver’s behavior. She said, “Please lie down. Don’t make a fuss.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver pressed the communication device on the bedside, and the guard outside the door came in immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver pointed at Cadence and said, “Take her away!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard responded, &#34;Yes, sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I’m not leaving! I’m the young miss of the Aura family! You can’t touch me! Windsor, I…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Candace’s voice gradually faded as she was dragged out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check her injury,&#34; Oliver instructed after seeing that blood had already trickled out of the cut on her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just a superficial wound. There’s no need to trouble Dr. May. I’ll just put a band-aid on it,” Natalie said. She wanted to pull her hand back, but Oliver’s grip was too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Oliver’s anger, Rosy quickly said, “No, no, we need to disinfect this. The cut is quite deep.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy knew that if she did not say anything now, Oliver was sure to blame her for it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s hurt, but he’s still so stubborn!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rosy treated the small cut on Natalie’s finger, Oliver sat on the bed and watched. He thought that Natalie was too fragile. Who knew her tender skin would break with just a slight touch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Oliver began to lecture Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalie, are you a fool? When someone bullies you, don’t you know how to retaliate?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘She’s my wife. No one’s allowed to bully her except for me! She could clearly handle her sister very well. Why is she so timid today?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said, feeling aggrieved, “I didn’t retaliate for your sake. She’s your friend after all!”</p>
