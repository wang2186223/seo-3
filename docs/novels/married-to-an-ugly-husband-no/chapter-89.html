                <p>“Natalie, we can go and get the food ourselves,” Wyatt said. He stood up immediately and pulled Rosy away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt less embarrassed now that no one was watching her, but she still could not relax. Being in the ward alone with Oliver made her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try it. It’s good,” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he did not object, she blew on the food softly before she brought the spoon to Oliver’s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver could smell the delicious fragrance of mushrooms and chicken. He stared at her slightly in a daze as he recalled her gentle and patient expression and her rosy lips as she blew to cool the food down. When he returned to his senses, he quickly parted his lips. He chewed on the food carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘As expected, the food she cooks is delicious…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that there was no complaint, Natalie silently fed him a piece of beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Oliver suddenly asked, “Who did you take care of in the past?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could tell that her actions were skillful. It was definitely not the first time she had fed someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas,&#34; Natalie replied as a hint of warmth appeared in her eyes, “I have experience taking care of Lucas. He was weak when he was young, so I had to look after him whenever he fell sick.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver’s eyes flashed briefly. He felt a twinge of pain in his heart. After all, when Lucas was young, she was not much older than Lucas. She was only four years older than Lucas, but she had to look after Lucas. Later on, the Watsons also did not care about the two siblings, so Natalie had to shoulder the responsibility of looking after Lucas as his older sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had been neglected by his father and had to take care of his brother, so he could empathize with her. He could not help but wonder if he had met her earlier, could he have spared her some hardship?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver? Do you not want to eat anymore?” Natalie asked, unaware of his thoughts. She only found it strange that he only ate half of what he usually ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver did not respond to her question. Instead, he asked, &#34;Have you eaten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, I’ll eat later,” Natalie said. She felt strange seeing that he seemed to be concerned about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m full.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Does he not have an appetite because of his injury?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie put away the food before she grabbed a damp towel to wipe his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to their proximity, Oliver could smell her sweet scent. The light was bright enough so he could see the peach fuzz on her face as well. Her focused gaze and gentle movements made her seem like she was caring for someone very important, and it warmed his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strand of her hair fell as she leaned down, and just as she was about to tuck it behind her ear, Oliver beat her to it. Although his movement was awkward, he was very gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned by the ambiguous and intimate action while Oliver continued to stare at her silently with a dark gaze. She quickly regained her composure, pretending to be calm while she took a step back. While doing so, she refrained from looking into his eyes, and her ears were slightly red. She said, “I’m going to go eat. Let me know if you need anything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her embarrassed and flustered appearance, Oliver smiled slightly and hummed in agreement. After she left, she looked at the meal she had forgotten to bring away and wondered why he had not invited her to share a meal with him earlier. However, when he thought about how she would likely refuse him because she did not like him, his expression turned cold immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After two seconds, Oliver skillfully picked up the cutlery with his left hand and continued eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy did not expect that she and Wyatt would be able to try the food that Natalie made, which Isaac had failed to taste previously. Unable to contain her excitement, she took a few photos and sent them to Isaac, intending to boast about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy: The food Natalie made is amazing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had returned to the company earlier to deal with some important work. If he had known that he would miss out on Natalie’s food, he would not have returned to the office even if it meant losing a million-dollar deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac suppressed the unfairness he felt and sent a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: Where’s Wyatt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited for Rosy’s reply with a hint of anticipation. If Wyatt did not eat Natalie’s food, he would feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alas, he received a photo of Wyatt happily eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac: How can both of you do this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy laughed gleefully. She could sense Isaac’s frustration through the screen and continued to taunt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy: Ah! It’s so delicious! Her skills are definitely on par with that of a Michelin chef!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Rosy was about to send another message, she received a prompt notifying her that she was no longer friends with Issac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Isaac had deleted her out of annoyance, Rosy muttered, “Childish!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Rosy saw Natalie, she called out, “Natalie!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the food to your liking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s delicious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt gave Natalie a thumbs-up. Now he understood why Charles had to return to Rosewood Estate every day to pick up food for Oliver. The food she made was truly delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was slightly embarrassed by the praise. She said, “I prepared the food according to Oliver’s condition, so it’s a bit bland. I’ll cook for you another time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There’ll be another time?&#34; Rosy asked, smiling in delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie laughed, thinking that Rosy was really easy to get along with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Wyatt left the hospital, and Rosy returned to her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie returned to the ward, the nurse had already cleared the table for Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was looking at some documents on his laptop at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at it and asked, “It’s in French?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you know French?” Oliver asked, surprised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded. &#34;Just a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Read it for me,&#34; Oliver said, wanting to know the extent of her knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; Natalie pointed at herself as she said, &#34; Aren’t you worried about me knowing your company secrets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver resisted the urge to ruffle her hair and said, “Just read it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Legally, half of RK Group’s assets belonged to her, so it did not matter even if she read the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh,” Natalie replied reluctantly, worried that if something happened in the company, she would be implicated.</p>
