                <p>Rhys disappeared from my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care if he was in jail or in a hospital, as long as he wasn&#39;t six feet under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fine Friday, and I was at the Nyx Collective studio admiring the necklace I&#39;d just designed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d used my employee perks to get it custom-made-my design,my materials, my signature, my everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was literally only one of these in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in two days, it was going to be Yvaine&#39;s birthday present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had barely had time to breathe in its perfection when my phone lit up with Yvaine&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. Had she somehow found out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up, bracing myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,I got:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That dickstain! Next time I see him, I&#39;m stapling his lying mouth shut. The balls on him, spewing bullshit like he&#39;s got a diploma in defamation. Did he eat shame for breakfast or was he just born this scummy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, slow down, what happened?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check your phone. I just sent you some screenshots.That sewer rat&#39;s mouthing off again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the images.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; I muttered. &#34;Rhys actually said that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Said it, sent it, and broadcast it,&#34; Yvaine spat &#34;Someone in his boys-only group chat leaked it. It&#39;s already in, like, fifteen chats. I saw it in a spin class group I don&#39;t even remember joining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it&#39;s going viral,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Everybody loves a good scandal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got myself added to his little dick-swinging group chat. Don&#39;t ask how. I tagged him in every message and asked him to retract his damn lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing he didn&#39;t comply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went silent, that weasel. Then someone kicked me out of the group, probably after Rhys went crying to the mod like the spineless little coward he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;You got the coward part right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not just a coward. He&#39;s a half-baked twatwaffle with a megaphone for a mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twatwaffle?&#34; I laughed. &#34;You, uh, seem to have picked up some new vocabulary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got loads more. That sad little fart-stain, walking around like his mouth&#39;s directly wired to his arse.Honestly, if he had half a brain cell, it&#39;d die of loneliness. Calling him useless is an insult to actual useless things. He and Catherine should get married already-perfect match, right down to the trash they spew. Cupid&#39;s algorithm finally doing its job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the phone away from my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her volume was breaking the sound barrier and rattling my skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breathe, Yvie,&#34; I told her. &#34;He&#39;s got nothing, so he&#39;s making stuff up to shift the blame. Don&#39;t give him the satisfaction of a reaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine huffed, but her voice dropped a decibel or two.&#34;He even sent voice messages, like he&#39;s the one being wronged. Can you believe the nerve? I could scream.I am screaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone would have been furious getting publicly dragged through the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I had already slipped into strategy mode. &#34;Cool your jets. Don&#39;t go back in the ring swinging just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope. No chance in hell. I need to get back in that group. I&#39;m not done with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could practically hear her rolling up her sleeves.War mode: activated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, don&#39;t, Yvie,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;Let them keep yapping. The worse it gets, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you fucking serious right now?&#34; she yelled. &#34;It&#39;s getting worse by the second. I swear, I&#39;m two clicks away from hiring some hacker to nuke their phones from orbit. You haven&#39;t seen everything I have. What I sent you was just the tip of the flaming shitberg.Rhys&#39;s idiot friends are talking so much shit, it&#39;d need a bleep every other word if I read it out loud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s okay. Let them keep talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You serious right now? Is this Mirabelle I&#39;m talking to?Or has some peace-loving alien taken over your body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just hear me out. Do you know anyone else in the group? Someone who can keep feeding us screenshots?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hell yes. One of my friends is in there. Rhys has no idea we&#39;re connected. He&#39;s my little undercover spy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. Tell him to keep grabbing everything. I want every single lie Rhys spits about me on record.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. Then Yvaine caught on. &#34;You&#39;re going legal, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn right I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up, messaged Savannah to cover for me,and left work early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t go home. I took a left instead, down the street behind Nyx Collective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered seeing a law firm near here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small place, nothing flashy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Rhys wanted to run his mouth, he could do it in court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist looked up from her computer with a  tired smile. &#34;Hello. Do you have an appointment?&#34;&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re closing soon, and all the lawyers are in meetings. Maybe come back on Monday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to turn, already planning to hit another firm or maybe just call someone online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a voice called out behind me: &#34;Mirabelle?Mirabelle Vance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped, glanced back, and saw a guy in a perfectly ironed suit stepping out of the lift with a black briefcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawyer vibes were written all over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at his face for a beat before it clicked.&#34;Finnigan Carter, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guilty as charged.&#34; He walked over, grinning. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could ask you the same. Are you working here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. You did pre-law in college, I remember now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, it&#39;s been ages,&#34; he said. &#34;You here for legal advice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I nodded, but glanced at the clock. &#34;But you guys are closing, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;Nah, come on. I&#39;ll take you. I just wrapped up my last case anyway. Was gonna sneak out early. Guess fate had other plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? I don&#39;t want to mess up your plans.&#34;</p>
