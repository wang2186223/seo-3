                <p>&#34;Hi, yeah, I&#39;d like to report stolen property. A vintage brooch, pearls and diamonds, easily worth seven figures. If someone refuses to return it, does that count as grand larceny? What kind of sentence are we talking-ten years minimum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing?!&#34; Caroline shrieked, full banshee mode. &#34;Have you lost your mind? Put that phone down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged from the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One slipper flew off mid-sprint, but she didn&#39;t even notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too busy flailing at me, trying to snatch the phone from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back calmly, dodging her grab like we were doing slow-mo tai chi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late.I already called the cops. They said they&#39;re on their way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs went wobbly, like someone had pulled the plug on her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called the police? Over this little thing? Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,now it&#39;s just&#39;alittle thing&#39;?&#34;I folded my arms. &#34;If it&#39;s so unimportant, why have you spent the last ten minutes playing keep-away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t call the police on your mother!&#34; she shrieked. &#34;What the hell is wrong with you? Do you even see me as family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got two minutes to bring down the brooch. If you do, I&#39;ll cancel the police report. If not, I&#39;tl tell them you stole the brooch from me and that it&#39;s worth millions. Let&#39;s see how that goes over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me like I&#39;d slapped her with a frying pan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her mouth twisted into something sour and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.You win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around and stomped upstairs, muttering God knows what under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably hexes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth was, I never made the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just wanted to scare the hell out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d paid any attention, she&#39;d have noticed I didn&#39;t give the &#39;police&#39; my address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just some light psychological warfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I wasn&#39;t exactly doing a happy dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I wanted was my own damn thing back, and she acted like I&#39;d demanded a kidney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This family had stopped seeing me as one of them a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of heels clattering down the staircase snapped me out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline came barreling down, looking like she&#39;d aged ten years in three minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved a mahogany box into my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.You got what you wanted. Now cancel the bloody call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I popped the box open and inspected the brooch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No scratches, no substitutions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I snapped the box shut and turned on my heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline came flapping after me like a pissed-off goose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle! Cancel the damn call! You really want the cops showing up on my doorstep? What will the neighbors think? Do you hear me? Tell them not to come!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t break stride. Just waved my phone over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. They&#39;re not coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was halfway down the driveway before she even hit the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I got a few houses away, I stopped. Turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three-story homes, all smug and cookie-cutter, lined both sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the fanciest part of Skyline City, but anyone living here wasn&#39;t clipping coupons either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grew up here, but that house wasn&#39;t mine anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun back, power-walked out of the neighborhood, and spotted Ashton&#39;s car parked by the curb like a black jaguar waiting to pounce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my face into something vaguely neutral, slid into the passenger seat, and buckled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got what you came for?&#34; he asked, eyes flicking to the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I set the box on my lap, fingers curling around the carved edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started the engine. &#34;Right. Off to the Office of the City Clerk. No backing out now, Miss Vance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;No backing out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we hit the main road, he glanced over. &#34;So, what was so important you had to show up at the crack of dawn to grab it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my thumb along the floral carving on the lid. &#34;It&#39;s the engagement gift the Grangers gave me. From back when we were still pretending that was a good idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? The Grangers gave you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I&#39;d caught a slight edge in his voice, but maybe I&#39;d just imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. It&#39;s a brooch. Passed down from Aunt Louisa&#39;s side. Some kind of family heirloom. Since the engagement&#39;s off, I can&#39;t keep it. Figured I&#39;d drop it off later. Tie up loose ends, you know. Maybe Aunt Louisa will finally see that I&#39;m serious about the breakup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good idea.&#34; He sounded sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The City Clerk&#39;s office came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We parked, got out, and headed straight in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were first in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no clue what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ashton moved like he&#39;d memorized the floor plan and speedran the tutorial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew every window, every form, every &#34;sign here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also looked like he was racing a bomb countdown. Just in case I bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, I was holding a crisp little piece of legal commitment in both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,I exhaled for the first time all morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My death grip on the marriage certificate loosened.⑦</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White. Boring fonts. Embossed stamps. Names, date, time, location, the usual robot-language confirming,yep,we&#39;d officially tied the knot. Signatures. A witness line I hadn&#39;t even registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, surprise-l learned my new husband&#39;s full name was Ashton Jules-Sylvain Laurent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared down at his signature like it might bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d really married him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Rhys Granger. Him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I okay? Unclear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing still felt floaty and unreal, like I&#39;d tripped and landed in someone else&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked side by side to the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped.&#34;Umn...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should I call him hubby? That sounded weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent, you go ahead. I&#39;m heading straight to the Grangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already pulling out my phone to call a cab when he said, &#34;I&#39;m not busy today. I&#39;ll drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the passenger door like it was non-negotiable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated.</p>
