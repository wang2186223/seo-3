                <p>I floated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in water. Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my limbs felt loose, weightless, like gravity had forgotten me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drifted in and out of sleep, memories slipping through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s arms. The sting of pool water against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A towel.A bed.Sleep. But not for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the blur of movement-his chest under my cheek, the lurch of a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was somewhere else after that. Multiple voices, hands on my forehead and wrist, an electronic beep,receding footsteps, then a different kind of quiet. Cooler air. Sterile, sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hospital. I knew the smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, something slid into my arm. A tube. IV fluid dripping, seeping into my bloodstream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold trickled in. I shivered in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were voices again. One of them soft, tight with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine? Maybe. I couldn&#39;t hold onto it long enough to be sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then sleep again. Real this time. Deep. Still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body sank, just for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But peace didn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something inside me stirred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a steady burn, crawling under my skin like lava waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every breath stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pillow was wet. The sheet stuck to my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clawed at the fabric near my collarbone, yanked it down, but it wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something moved beside me.Weight shifted. Air brushed my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the electronic beep of a thermometer, then a damp towel draped over my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached.Found a chest. Solid, broad, warm, but not scorching. The shirt was soft with wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed it and pulled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, Mira. I&#39;m not leaving. Just going to the bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a guttural sound. My arm locked around his middle. Yanked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my cheek to his chest. His heartbeat thumped, steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surface of his skin felt cooler than mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not cool enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my face lower, across the fabric, searching for more coolness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers popped a button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand caught my wrist.&#34;Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another button gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skin. Cooler there. I pressed my mouth to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He twitched. His stomach rose under my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there, inhaling. Laundry soap. Salt. The faint scent of sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My leg hooked around his hip. My thigh slid against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath changed. Slower. Rougher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the rest of the shirt free, shoved it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands spread over his chest, mapping the shape of him. Smooth skin, soft hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My palms moved with purpose, flattening, roaming, learning him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted again, rubbing my face over his chest, tracing the dips and contours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Found cooler patches and chased them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath his collarbone. Along his ribs. Down to his navel. Pressed my cheek there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jerked. His thigh tensed under mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers slid under the waistband of his trousers, searching for the line between warm and cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a shape.Rounded, soft. Definitely not cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grunt. &#34;Mira!&#34; His hand gripped my shoulder and dragged my face away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another hand threw a blanket over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked it off the bed. Air hit my skin.Better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any time I felt fabric-shirt, sheet, waistband-I shoved it aside. Too hot. It held the heat like insulation.I wanted none of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked at his trousers. Tugged at mine. Anything that clung to skin, I fought off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught my wrist again, this time laughing under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much as I&#39;d like to see you naked, this is a hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care.I growled.Clung tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he left. The bed shifted, his weight gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huff escaped my throat. I struggled to open my eyes, but my eyelids weighed a ton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then cool pressed to my forehead. Damp. Soft. A towel or ice pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief hit like a gust of wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let myseIf sink into the mattress. Muscles unknotted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He climbed in behind me, his arm sneaking around my waist. Warm again.Heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved at his chest, annoyed. I wanted the cold, not the furnace of his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused. Didn&#39;t move. Then pulled back. The mattress lifted slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered something. I didn&#39;t catch the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two more ice packs later, the coolness settled my skin. My breathing evened out. My head stopped throbbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the human blanket came back and was heating me uup again. His chest, his arms-too warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin started to prickle. I squirmed. My thigh rubbed against his. Still too hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to slide out of his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm clamped around my waist like a seatbelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered under my breath. Pushed at his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried twisting, rolling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half my body slid off the mattress before he pulled me back in with one swift tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful,&#34; he muttered, his voice thick with sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might have glared. Maybe I just imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too hot,&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence, then the weight shifted. He rolled away. The bed dipped. Rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Air filled the space he used to occupy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the ice pack and didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hte said something, maybe an oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His weight left the bed, but his scent lingered.</p>
