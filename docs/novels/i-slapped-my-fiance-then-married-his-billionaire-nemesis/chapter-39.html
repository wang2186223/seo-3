                <p>When I opened the door to grab the mail, Ashton was already standing there with a coffee tray and a paper bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked. &#34;Uh, morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came out awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couldn&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, I&#39;d somehow agreed to marry the man,and my brain was still buffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; he said smoothly. &#34;I brought breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. Come in. You look... nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understatement of the damn year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wearing a three-piece charcoal grey suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the stiff Wall Street kind, but something sharp and clearly custom-made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lapels were narrow, the trousers tailored within an inch of their life, and the stitching at the cuffs was subtle hand-embroidered initials-AL.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesus. Even his tie looked smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People complimented well-dressed men by saying they looked like a million bucks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Ashton, I&#39;d have to add three more zeros, and that still felt like lowballing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ate in the living room, though neither of us ate much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My croissant sat there flaking quietly while my brain looped through the phrase &#34;I&#39;m getting married today&#34;like a bad ringtone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about fifteen minutes of poking at the pastries,I glanced at the clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still early</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The City Clerk&#39;s Office wouldn&#39;t open for another hour and a half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you mind making a detour first?&#34; I asked,not quite meeting his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; he said instantly.s long as we&#39;re not late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In silence, mostly, because there were only so many ways to fill the air between &#34;Want to get married?&#34;and &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled up outside the Vance residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unbuckled. &#34;Thanks. I won&#39;t be long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to come with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, then shook my head. &#34;No. I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the door handle, then paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. He deserved context.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said. About Aunt Louisa. You were right-I shouldn&#39;t let guilt steer my decisions just because she&#39;s been... decent to me.&#34;l sighed. &#34;Marriage should be about me and the person I&#39;m actually marrying. Not how charming his mum might be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just gave me a slight nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave Rhys the ring back ages ago. But there&#39;s something else I forgot to return to theGrangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been an exchange of gifts when our families arranged the engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad gave the Grangers an heirloom gold ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa had it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Grangers&#39; gift had been a vintage brooch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to family lore, it once belonged to Louisa&#39;s great-great-great-grandmother, who probably wore it while judging people in oil paintings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My parents had kept it locked away in a safe somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I stepped inside the house, only Caroline was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the sofa, sipping coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well. Look whno finally showed her face,&#34; she sneered, without looking away from her mug. &#34;You sounded real tough on the phone the other day. And now you&#39;ve come crawling back? After slapping Catherine and Serenna in front of half the city? Unless you&#39;re here to apologize, save your breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got nothing to apologize for. If anything Catherine should be apologizing for sleeping with my fiancé, and Serenna for trying to steal hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her coffee cup hit the table so hard I thought the glass would crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! I raised you. I fed you, clothed you,paid for your bloody orthodontist. And now you think you can just cut us off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here we go. Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t start with the Greatest Hits,&#34; I cut her off fast.&#34;I didn&#39;t come here for a lecture. I came for the brooch the Grangers gave us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned like I&#39;d asked for her kidneys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a full five seconds to even remember what I was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you want that brooch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s your business. It was given to me. It belongs to me.&#34; My patience was already on a three-second fuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not,&#34; she snapped, all tight-jawed fury.&#34;You&#39;re planning to return it, aren&#39;t you? To the Grangers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if I am? Louisa gave it to me. I can do with it whatever I like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked my watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d stupidly thought this would be quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In, out, done. Five minutes, max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no,Caroline was digging her heels in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your mother. I have every right to hold on to it for safekeeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, safekeeping. As in, you&#39;re just the storage unit. And newsflash, when something&#39;s mine, I can take it back whenever the hell I want. Like...now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not. It&#39;s way too valuable to just hand over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes. &#34;Are you giving it to me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffed,mouth curling into that nasty little smirk she probably practiced in the mirror. &#34;Even if I did give it away, it wouldn&#39;t be to you. If Rhys gets engaged to Catherine, she should have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then wait till they&#39;re engaged. Until then, it&#39;s still mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I didn&#39;t hand that brooch back to Louisa myself,she&#39;d keep thinking there was still something between me and Rhys.Which...ew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still no.&#34; Caroline&#39;s eyes darted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew damn well if Louisa had the final say, she&#39;d never let that heirloom piece land on Catherine&#39;s backstabbing chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised a brow. &#34;Oh, I see. You&#39;re scared Louisa and the Grangers won&#39;t accept Catherine, right? Scared that even if Rhys does propose, Louisa&#39;s going to pretend she doesn&#39;t see her? So you&#39;re just going to hoard the brooch like some paranoid dragon and hope no one notices? That&#39;s delusional, even for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nostrils flared so wide I thought she might actually combust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How I handle things is my business,&#34; she hissed. &#34;And mind your bloody tone. I&#39;m your mother, not someone you get to lecture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool. Then you&#39;ll love this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whipped out my phone and started dialing.</p>
