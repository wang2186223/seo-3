                <p>I didn&#39;t bother with a sob story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just apologized for the delay and launched straight into my pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tugged my shirt into place and let the projector warm up, using those precious seconds to steady my breathing and slow my heart down from hummingbird -on-espresso mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t looking at sketches yet, just raw concept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called mine BloomState.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every piece was based on the fleeting moments flowers go through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started with the bud: tiny stud earrings, twisted into a barely-there spiral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the open heart necklace. A stylized bloom,fully open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Seed Pod Ring was the show-off. All structure and sharp angles, but with a kind of quiet rhythm to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, the Dewdrop Collar. Fine chain, light-catching stones that looked like drops of morning dew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d studied Eliza Black&#39;s whole catalog, stalked every fan theory thread, and read every fashion blogger&#39;s take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was known for being playful, but this was going to rebrand her as a bloody icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through, I found my rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice evened out, and my words stopped tripping over each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliza didn&#39;t react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a blink, not a twitch, not even a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just sat there, still masked, legs crossed, arms folded, the human equivalent of a locked phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at least she didn&#39;t look like she was about to bolt anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I wrapped, her agent stood up. &#34;She has a shoot. We&#39;re already running late. We&#39;ll let you know our decision soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the door shut, Savannah rounded on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know how many people were sat here twiddling their thumbs waiting on you? If I hadn&#39;t begged and bartered like a bloody hostage negotiator,they&#39;d have walked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah had a mouth like a guillotine but a heart made of marshmallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t mad at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was mad at how close I&#39;d come to flushing the opportunity of the year down the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swigged an entire bottle of mineral water before l could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Savannah, babe, I swear I didn&#39;t know they changed the time. If I&#39;d known the meeting was today, do you seriously think I&#39;d have been at home passed out in my pajamas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the gears grinding behind her smoky eyeliner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the kind to ditch work without a damn good reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d done late nights voluntarily, just to use the studio&#39;s centrifugal caster when no one else was hogging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freelance or not, I&#39;d earned my stripes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Savannah turned her head slowly and aimed that laser glare at Chloe Shaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you not tell Mira the meeting time was moved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The admin assistant looked like a startled fawn caught in headlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe was fresh off probation, officially signed on last month, and still walked like she hadn&#39;t broken in her heels yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did! I told her!&#34; Her voice took on a whiny, panicky edge. &#34;I told everyone, like, two days ago. I swear l told Mira. I said it to her in person. There&#39;s no way she didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped my laptop shut. &#34;Funny. I haven&#39;t seen you in days. What time exactly did you tell me? Give me the full deets, timestamp and all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twitched. &#34;It was right before the end of the day, around 4:30? Savannah told me it was super important everyone knew, so I told everyone one by one.Just to be safe.Face-to-face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice piped up behind me. &#34;Yeah,Chloe was really clear about it. Kept reminding me like ten times. You don&#39;t get interns this conscientious anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy piping up had Violet Lin&#39;s scent all over him-same fake charm, same smug loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her little fan club had clearly rehearsed their lines ahead of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes chilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Chloe Shaw and asked, slowly, like I was offering her a last chance to stop digging her grave,&#34;If you really came to tell me, in the office, on Friday afternoon, then someone must&#39;ve seen you. Who can back you up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, ah, I went to you when the office was empty. No one was around. So... no, no one saw me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a haha-funny laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More of a you&#39;ve-got-to-be-fucking-kidding-me laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.Four-thirty,just before clock-out? You expect me to believe the entire floor was a ghost town?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a single day when that place was quiet at 4:30.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were usually hovering by the printer, bitching about deadlines, stealing snacks from the breakroom,or pretending to work while online shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms and stared her down. &#34;If no one saw you, no one can back up your story. Maybe you should&#39;ve thought of a better lie than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the tears came-messy, theatrical, just the right amount of pitiful to stir sympathy in the cheap seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle, I swear I told you! Why would I lie? I know you think I&#39;m inexperienced. Fine, I am just a fresh grad, but I take my job seriously. It means everything to me. You can&#39;t say that... you&#39;ll get me fired!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet Lin glided over and handed Chloe a tissue.&#34;Mira,come on. Chloe&#39;s never had any beef with you. Why would she leave you out on purpose? You were late and you&#39;re just lashing out at a newbie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another one jumped in. &#34;Yeah, poor Chloe. She&#39;d never do that on purpose. Look at her. She&#39;s crushed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the first one in, last one out. Always working her arse off. Don&#39;t throw her under the bus like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd murmured their approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, I was now the wicked witch who picked on interns for sport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a slow breath. &#34;I haven&#39;t even raised my voice,and she&#39;s already sobbing like I keyed her car. No one saw you tell me, Chloe. You&#39;ve got no proof. I&#39;m the one you were allegedly talking to, and I don&#39;t remember it happening. Make that make sense. Or we can just check the security footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were red, nose running, full-on ugly crying now. &#34;I did tell you, I swear! It just so happened no one saw it. You were late, you almost screwed everything up, and now you&#39;re blaming me because you&#39;re scared of getting in trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled. &#34;If you really want to throw accusations at me, fine. I&#39;m the lowest-ranking nobody here. All I do is fetch coffee and alphabetize the stationery cupboard. I&#39;ll just quit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And boom-crowd reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps.Murmurs. An entire chorus of &#34;don&#39;t quit, Chloe!&#34;bursting out like she&#39;d just announced she had two days to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah smacked thetable like a judge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care if Chloe forgot to pass the message or if Mirabelle hit snooze too many times. This mess ends now. From today on, every communication gets documented-text, email, whatever. Meeting over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left with my jaw tight and my face frozen in neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before I reached the door, I caught Violet Lin watching me,smirking</p>
