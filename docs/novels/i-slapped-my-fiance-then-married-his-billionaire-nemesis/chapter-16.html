                <p>Ashton was scanning the hallway when the stairwell door flew open and Mirabelle barrelled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked furious. Gorgeous, obviously-but furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, like a nasty aftertaste, Rhys Granger followed her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw tightened. He&#39;d never met the guy in person, but he recognized himn from photos and the extensive background check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys, the ex-fiancé. A trust fund guy with anger management issues, and apparently, the emotional maturity of a wet sock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Ashton saw the expression on Rhys&#39;s face,he knew what was about to happen. The guy had that look-the same look idiots get right before they do something incredibly stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton moved fast. Long strides, no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle saw him coming, surprise flickering in her eyes, but there wasn&#39;t time to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys was already raising his arm, going for a cheap shot from behind like the absolute coward he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t,think. He just moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His left arm wrapped around Mirabelle&#39;s waist,yanking her out of range, while his right leg shot out and slammed into Rhys&#39;s knee with the kind of precision that made footballers cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys folded like a broken deckchair and crashed into the stairwell wall with a satisfying thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she understood what just happened,Mirabelle didn&#39;t flinch. She simply stared at Rhys with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? That&#39;s your move?&#34; She shook her head.&#34;Trying to punch me when my back&#39;s turned? Christ,Rhys, I knew you were a spineless little worm, but this is pathetic, even for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton looked down at her, checking her face. &#34;You all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle hesitated. &#34;Louisa&#39;s still in surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton gave Rhys a pointed glance. &#34;Yeah, but you don&#39;t need to spend the next few hours in a corridor with him. My assistant&#39;s on standby. He&#39;ll call the second there&#39;s any update. The surgery could take all night. You being here doesn&#39;t make the clock tick faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it over, then nodded. &#34;Fair enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton walked her to the car, opened the door, and waited until she was tucked inside before sliding into the driver&#39;s seat and starting the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even as they pulled away, his eyes kept darting to the rear-view mirror like she might vanish if he blinked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked pensive. What was she thinking about?Louisa? Rhys? Him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t believe in fate-he trusted planning,power, and contracts-but he still thanked whatever cosmic nonsense had convinced him to return to Skyline City earlier than planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t have seen her break up with Rhys, wouldn&#39;t have been the man she dragged away from a bar for a one-night stand, and definitely wouldn&#39;t have ended up playing the role of her fake fiancé.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know it yet, but Ashton had no intention of staying fake for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning in the hotel, when he asked if she remembered him, her blank stare hadn&#39;t surprised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointed him,yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But surprised? Not really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years was a long time, and she&#39;d only been a teenager back then-baby-faced, all nerves and big dreams, standing on a stage at some inter-school tech expo, pitching her clunky smart jewellery prototype like she was about to revolutionize the entire industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d looked terrified, but there was a kind of fire in her,the sort that made people stop and pay attention,even in a room full of bored judges and cynical  investors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hadn&#39;t been one of them, not officially. Just doing a favor for a friend, reviewing submissions for a grant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she tripped on her way out, and he caught her before she hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d looked up, breathless and wide-eyed, thanked him like he&#39;d saved her life, and disappeared before he could say a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never knew his name. Probably didn&#39;t even register his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he remembered everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now here she was again, older, tougher,still standing tall after being dragged through hell by a man who didn&#39;t deserve her and a family that never protected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton wasn&#39;t letting her walk away. Not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fake engagement was just the opening move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he&#39;d told her his family was pressuring him to get married,he hadn&#39;t lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vultures had been circling since he landed back in Skyline-cousins with matchmakers, uncles with ultimatums, his stepmother with her trademark emotional blackmail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he left out was the part where he could&#39;ve shut it all down with one Look. His family didn&#39;t push him;they tiptoed around him. They feared him, and that suited him just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he let her believe the pressure was real. Gave her the whole &#34;expectations&#34; speech because he knew it would make her soften, make her say yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he knew this wasn&#39;t about convenience or family pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only woman who&#39;d ever made his heart stutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only one he&#39;d ever wanted for more than a night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only one he wanted for every night, for the rest of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was in his passenger seat,legs crossed,face turned to the window, breathing like she hadn&#39;t completely undone him just days ago in that hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should&#39;ve been watching the road, but his eyes kept sliding to her-her profile in the low light,the way her fingers twitched against her thigh, the soft scent of her shampoo threading through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smelled like sugar and fire. Like trouble he&#39;d gladly ruin himself for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been tipsy that night. He hadn&#39;t. He remembered it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the exact sound she made when he kissed the inside of her thigh. The way her hands gripped his hair. The way she arched her back as she came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they shook hands on the fake engagement deal, she didn&#39;t know he already had the ending written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A real ring. A real marriage. Her signature next to his on everything from a marriage license to a cemetery plot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe she still thought this was a favor. A temporary fix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ashton knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she didn&#39;t know it yet, he&#39;d make damn sure she did-soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stole another glance at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could feel the heat rise just thinking about that night. The sound of her voice, her skin against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But another thought made his jaw clench: if he hadn&#39;t shown up at that bar, would she have gone home with someone else? Someone with a pretty face like that smug bastard Rhys?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s grip on the steering wheel tightened. He would burn down the city before he let anyone like that near her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to move faster. Cut the pretence. Turn this engagement into something permanent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he had to lie, manipulate, or play every dirty card he had to keep her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So be it.</p>
