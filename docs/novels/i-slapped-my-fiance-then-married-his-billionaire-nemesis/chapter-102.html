                <p>&#34;None of your business,&#34; I said, already turning away now that the show was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys barked, &#34;Stop! I&#39;m not done talking to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you have something to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys was scrutinizing my face as if he were searching for a crack in the wall. &#34;Cathy&#39;s pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed at my ear. &#34;I know.I heard.Not deaf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine, who had been busy scowling at me, snapped her head toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw dropped. Her eyes went wide, suddenly so bright they outshone the lights overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good for you,&#34; I said. &#34;Guess that means wedding bells. Do us both a favor and leave me off the guest list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys! I-&#34; Catherine beamed. She looked radiant. Maybe it was the pregnancy, maybe it was his love-who could tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush.&#34; Rhys disentangled her arm from his and stepped up to me. &#34;You don&#39;t want to come to our wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Are you afraid it&#39;s going to be awkward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m afraid there won&#39;t be enough seats for all your exes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not just one of my exes. You&#39;re Cathy&#39;s sister, which means we&#39;ll be family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a heroic effort not to gag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he hear himself? Or was it some kind of honor to brag that he used to sleep with his sister-in-law? Ugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m happy for you,&#34; I said dryly, though my tone was anything but. &#34;Hope you two go the distance,because once this one tanks, there aren&#39;t enough single women left in Skyline City for you to date. Not unless you start recycling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together. The corners of his mouth turned down. He shifted his shoulders as if his jacket had suddenly stiffened into cardboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all?&#34; I glanced at my nonexistent watch. &#34;I&#39;ve got stuff to do, so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s eyes kept ping-ponging between me and Rhys-gloating at me one second, beaming lovingly at him the next. She was like a human traffic light with only two colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys looked over my shoulder. &#34;You&#39;re here alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Seems that way. But, once again, none of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;d shown half this much interest in me back when we were dating, my heart might have done somersaults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now? Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine chimed in, &#34;That&#39;s depressing. No one came with you? You&#39;re here all by yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your husband?&#34; Rhys spat the last word like it had an aftertaste. There was no&#39;s&#39; in it, yet he still managed to hiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s busy.&#34; Ruling his business empire from two floors up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Rhys&#39;s tone lightened, as if pleased. &#34;So that&#39;s the kind of man you picked. Can&#39;t even bother showing up for a hospital vist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a short laugh. &#34;As if you ever came with me. Name one time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The few times I&#39;d had a fever and called, he&#39;d said I was faking it for attention and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I learned not to bother after the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine cut in, clearly sensing we were drifting into dangerous nostalgia.&#34;Don&#39;t you have somewhere to be? We&#39;ve got a room tour scheduled. Can&#39;t stand around all day talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys shook off her arm and eyed me again-my outfit, my hands-and something flickered in his expression.A smug glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum told me you showed her a wedding certificate. Said it looked legit. But I knew it was fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Because you&#39;re such an expert in document forgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re not wearing a wedding ring,&#34; he announced his big discovery. &#34;If you&#39;re really married,and to a man like Ashton Laurent, why didn&#39;t he give you a ring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore it to Edouard Laurent&#39;s party as part of the charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But somewhere between falling into the pool, getting dragged out, and the mad dash to the hospital, it must&#39;ve slipped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mental note: Ask Ashton about it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No clever comeback?&#34; Rhys tilted his chin. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you did to rope Ashton in, but it won&#39;t hold.Not forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine looked more than ready to cut the conversation short. She tugged at Rhys&#39;s sleeve again.He ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;ve really got Ashton under control, I&#39;ll eat my shoes. You two have been married how long,and no one&#39;s seen a single photo, no statement, nothing. You ask me, you got lucky pulling that bluff, but it&#39;s not going to last. Once whatever hold you have over him wears off, he&#39;ll come after you-hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of hold do you imagine I have over him? Nude selfies?&#34; I looked down my nose at Rhys, which was hard to do considering he had the height advantage. &#34;You think he&#39;s the type to cave to blackmail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, you&#39;re supposedly married and he&#39;s not even here,&#34; Catherine backed up her boyfriend. &#34;You never brought him home. He hasn&#39;t even met Mum and Dad. No one knows you two are married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one? Try the four hundred guests at Edouard Laurent&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to point that out, then stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was I even engaging in this argument with the sister I couldn&#39;t stand and the ex I&#39;d rather see under a bus?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;Like I said: none of your business. Stay out of my life, and I&#39;II stay out of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Running off now that we&#39;ve seen through your lie?&#34; Rhys&#39;s grin was obnoxious. Then he softened his voice into something mock-sympathetic. &#34;I get it, Mira. You&#39;re trying to save face. You don&#39;t have to fake a marriage just because Cathy and I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save what face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just because Cathy and I are getting married doesn&#39;t mean you need to conjure up some fake husband.It&#39;s not a contest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fake? I wasn&#39;t aware l&#39;was fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all turned.</p>
