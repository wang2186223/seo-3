                <p>Ashton watched Mira snap photos of the marriage certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she mentioned Yvaine, he&#39;d had the dumbest thought: I want to show someone too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s how he ended up calling Cassian Langford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drinks tonight. The Rookery. Nine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 9:02 p.m., Cassian was there in their usual private room, already half a bottle deep and complaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ghost me yesterday, drag me out tonight, and now we&#39;re just... sitting? Mate, what&#39;s the deal? And where&#39;s the rest of the crew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had barely opened his mouth when Cassian suggested, &#34;Should I call in a couple of waiters to play Omaha or something? This is tragic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two waiters came in and shuffled cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton sat to Cassian&#39;s left, casually placing his right hand on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right in Cassian&#39;s line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ring wasn&#39;t just visible-it practically screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian squinted. &#34;What the hell&#39;s that on your hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ring. Just got it today. Haven&#39;t resized itt yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian tossed back his drink. &#34;Who gave you a ring?&#34;&#34;My wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your-wait-your what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian shot upright like the chair was electrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hit your head? Are you high? Who the fuck is your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s lips twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled the marriage certificate-now laminated-from his inner jacket pocket and slid it across the table like it was an ace of spades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian stared for a full thirty seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he picked it up gingerly with two fingers as if it might explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle Vance?&#34; he read, syllable by syllable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes glazed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand went to his temple as if he was about to faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I forgotten how to read? Is this real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton snatched the certificate back before the grease from Cassian&#39;s fingers could do any damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked it away with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You read it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian let out a howl that shook the chandelier. &#34;You are married?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took a lazy sip of his whisky. &#34;Why? Jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jealous? Mate, I&#39;m traumatized!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian dropped into his chair as if his legs had given out, arms sprawled on either side as he stared at Ashton like he&#39;d sprouted an alien head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your bloody mind? Everyone and their therapist knows Mirabelle Vance is tangled up with Rhys Granger. And you married her? I thought you were going to die single. You didn&#39;t even say a word to me before signing the damn papers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton flicked him a look like he was slow-witted.&#34;She and Rhys broke up ages ago. Called off the engagement. Why can&#39;t I marry her? What,you want her to wear widow&#39;s weeds for life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what l-&#34; Cassian grabbed the glass of water as if it was vodka and chugged half of it. &#34;But how the hell did this even happen? Don&#39;t tell me she conned you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t con me,&#34; Ashton said coolly. &#34;I conned her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian froze. &#34;Come again? You conned her? How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told her my family&#39;s been harassing me to get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian flung his arms up like a referee calling foul.&#34;Who in the Laurent dynasty would dare harass you?You&#39;re just out here lying to innocent women for sport now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton caressed the ring on his finger. &#34;I also said my grandfather&#39;s dying. Guilt-tripped her for sympathy points.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Your grandfather&#39;s got chronic gout, not terminal cancer. When was he dying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He dies when I need him to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian stared at him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, what the fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a psychopath. A literal villain. This is fraud.You should be in prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton let out a dismissive snort through his nose. 2He didn&#39;t even try to deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian suddenly sprang forward. &#34;Hold up. This doesn&#39;t make any sense. You&#39;ve been hung up on someone for years and suddenly-poof-over it in a week back home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s mouth curved. &#34;I didn&#39;t get over her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... what?&#34; Cassian&#39;s brows nearly hit his hairline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton leaned back. &#34;It&#39;s her. Mirabelle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian stared, completely blanking for a second.&#34;Mirabelle? I thought the girl you were obsessed with was in Italy. You told me so yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not from Italy. She went to Italy. That&#39;s where I met her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian flung an arm out and waved away the two waiters. &#34;Out. Door. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They scrambled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poker&#39;s off?&#34; Ashton deadpanned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Screw poker. Start talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton chuckled under his breath. &#34;It was Florence.Seven years ago. I met her at an international jewellery design competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian blinked. &#34;Seven years-wait, that means she was what, sixteen, seventeen? Jesus. You were-dude,you were an adult. That&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton smacked his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not hard. Just enough to shut himn up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow! Assault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was still in school. Finalist in the under-twenty category. I was there as a sponsor. We spoke for maybe five seconds. That was it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian grabbed the bottle, poured one for Ashton,then himself. &#34;So what, it was love at first sight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stared at the glass. Then shook his head. &#34;No.Not love. Not then. She was-almost grown, but still figuring herself out. I remembered her, yeah. But it didn&#39;t hit me then. Not really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So when did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second time.Eindhoven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian clicked his fingers. &#34;I remember. You&#39;d already built a damn empire in Europe. Moved your headquarters to Eindhoven, right?&#34; He nudged Ashton  with a smirk. &#34;And I remember the queue of men and women lining up to get in your bed. Some even tried flirting with me, thinking I was the side door to the main event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,Cassian wasn&#39;t wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Ashton had been in his mid-twenties,drowning in attention from people who saw his money and assumed he was easy prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was young. Alone in Europe. Surrounded by staff,assistants,hangers-on-but no family, no safety net.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with all his paranoia, there had been moments when his guard slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night, it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fancy venue, expensive wine, fake smiles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been careful-he was always careful-but someone still managed to drug his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d fought through it, barely stayed on his feet,stumbled out of the hotel like a drunk boxer in the twelfth round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And ran straight into her.</p>
