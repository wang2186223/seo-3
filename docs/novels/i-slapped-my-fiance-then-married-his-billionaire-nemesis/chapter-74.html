                <p>I walked in a minute later, tipsy, still giggling at some dumb meme Yvaine had just sent me. Something about a guy trying to deep-throat a corn dog and nearly dying forit-quality content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t thought Ashton would still be awake.Definitely hadn&#39;t expected him to be sitting dead center in the living room like some kind of final boss,staring straight at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes met. Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grin froze. I snapped my phone shut too hard and wobbled sideways, pressing my fingers to my temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drank way too much,&#34; I mumbled.&#34;Gonna crash.Nightttt...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I staggered like my knees had melted, clinging to the banister like it owed me rent. Giving him a wide berth, I dragged my feet upstairs, feeling his gaze right up my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t break character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second I made it to the bedroom, I shut the door behind me like I&#39;d just outrun a serial killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped straight into the shower and let the water blast me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it.&#34; I thudded my forehead against the ceramic tile, while a mental porno featuring Ashton played on a loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks,Yvaine,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d met up earlier and she&#39;d picked up right where she&#39;d left off at her birthday, as if no time had passed. Apparently, my &#39;married life&#39; was now her favorite drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grilled me like I was on trial for Crimes Against Horniness, cross-examining me over every single sexless second I&#39;d spent under the same roof as Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her we hadn&#39;t slept together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well. Not since that one time in the hotel room, pre-fake-marriage, pre-everything. So technically, it didn&#39;t count.Right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a look like I&#39;d just told her I enjoyed beige wallpaper and abstinence. &#34;What the hell&#39;s wrong with you? You sleep next to that and don&#39;t tap it? Where&#39;s your libido? Menopause hit early or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t sleep next to him,&#34; I corrected her. &#34;And my libido&#39;s doing just fine, thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes. &#34;Yeah, clearly. Thnat&#39;s why you&#39;re living with a guy who looks like sin on legs and not riding him like a stolen bike. I&#39;d be on him every morning before coffee and again after dinner, just for the cardio.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not you, Yvaine. And it&#39;s all fake, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fake marriage doesn&#39;t mean fake orgasms. If you met him under normal circumstances, you&#39;d have nailed him, admit it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,I would.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And,technically, I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s stopping you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to make things more complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You overthink everything. Mira, babe, I love you like family, but you&#39;re a damn coward. You move slower than-what&#39;s a slow-ass animal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tortoise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Slower than a constipated tortoise. Look, life&#39;s short.You admit you like him,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Like&#39; is a stretch-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, you like his body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, yeah. I mean, I have eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You emotionally tangled up with anyone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And he&#39;s not either?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t asked him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means no. So what the fuck are you waiting for? Go home, yank his trousers down, and ride him like a champion. And if you&#39;re feeling rusty, I&#39;ve got a few instructional videos-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when the pub&#39;s PA crackled on with an apologetic, &#34;We&#39;re closing early tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was out of the shower, in an oversized T-shirt,flopped on the bed like a regret-flavored pancake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you, Yvaine,&#34; I muttered, dragging a pillow over my face.&#34;Could&#39;ve at least airdropped me the vid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late. My brain had already started shooting its own movie. And Ashton was the star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost screamed when there was a knock at my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Laurent,&#34; Carmen called gently. &#34;&#39;You probably need hydration. I&#39;ve brought you some lemon and honey in warm water, and Advil if you&#39;ve got a headache.May I come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked away the X-rated image. &#34;Thanks, Carmen.Door&#39;s open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except when it swung open, it wasn&#39;t Carmen standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took the tray from her hands and strolled into my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him. He stared back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-like some divine slapstick punishment-my phone slipped and smacked me in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; I muttered, rubbing my cheek. Great. A black eye to go with the slow.death of my dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, thank you. Can you just put the tray on the nightstand? I&#39;ll drink it in a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned, slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still there. Still staring. Standing two paces from my bed. He said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled over and buried my face in the duvet likean ostrich. &#34;Ugh, migraine. So tired. Gonna pass out.Bye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please leave, please leave, please get the hell out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there, holding my breath as if I were auditioning to be a corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the quiet clink of the tray hitting the nightstand. But no footsteps walking away. Just an awful silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was beating so hard I could hear it in my ears. Every second dragged like a horror film jump scare that never came..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly suffocating, I poked my head out and risked a peek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wardrobe mirror caught his reflection. His eyes were lowered, his gaze fixed somewhere on my back.And I was suddenly very aware that I was wearing only a T-shirt. No bra, no panties. And the shirt had ridden up when I&#39;d jumped into bed, the hem now somewhere mid-cheek. Where his eyes were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t moving. Just watching. Just standing there and staring at me like he had nothing better to do than mentally strip me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I couldn&#39;t fix my shirt without admitting that l knew he was looking. That I cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I just played dead. A half-naked, very humiliated corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after what felt like a decade, he moved.I tensed like a cat about to bolt, but all he did was step forward, lean down, and gently pull the blanket up over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked it around me like I was five and not actively dying of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned into the pillow.</p>
