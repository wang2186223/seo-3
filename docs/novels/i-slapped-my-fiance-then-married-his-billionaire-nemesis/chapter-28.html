                <p>Thirty seconds later, the giant screen in the center of the ballroom lit up, crystal-clear like some Hollywood premiere,every detail sharp enough to catch the sweat prickling on Catherine&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where I stood near the open door, I had the perfect view of the disaster unfolding downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys whipped around to stare at Catherine. &#34;You said Mirabelle was stirring up trouble, pulling the tablecloth and trying to pin it on you. So explain to me why, in that footage, it&#39;s your hand yanking the cloth,and Mira&#39;s nowhere near it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine burst into tears on cue, shaking so hard her diamond earrings rattled. She stammered for ages,blubbering, &#34;Maybe I, I tugged it by accident? Mirabelle kept provoking me, and I panicked, I thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was buying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine grabbed Rhys&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Rhys, I didn&#39;t mean to cause trouble! Mirabelle set me off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton cut in, &#34;Miss Vance, the cameras record audio too. If you insist on your innocence, I can have them pull the full footage from when you arrived. Let&#39;s all hear exactly how Mirabelle &#39;provoked&#39; you, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Catherine yelped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut up after that, probably realizing no amount of ugly crying was going to spin this train wreck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mascara was sliding down her face in greasy black rivers, but Rhys wasn&#39;t even looking at her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, breathing like he wanted to strangle someone, before forcing himself to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could smell the regret sweating off him. He was probably wishing he could go back five minutes and take back every stupid thing he had said to Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, in a voice so stiff it could snap in half, Rhys muttered, &#34;Catherine made a... a mnistake. She didn&#39;t mean to wreck the party. It was... an impulsive lapse of judgment. Catherine, apologize to Mr... Laurent.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s eyes widened at Ashton&#39;s name. She stared at Rhys in disbelief, then at Ashton. Then, finally,like Rhys, she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she scrambled to throw out a million &#34;sorry&#39;s&#34;in Ashton&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut her off, voice like a blade: &#34;You&#39;re apologizing to the wrong person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine froze. Her gaze slid to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah. I was the one she needed to grovel to. And judging by her twisted face, she&#39;d rather eat glass than say sorry to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; she stammered, the words choking in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like Miss Vance isn&#39;t exactly drowning in remorse,&#34; Ashton said, flashing a look at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cue the bouncers. Two guys in black suits stormed in and grabbed Catherine by both arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had time to blink before they started dragging her towards the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;ll apologize! Mirabelle, I&#39;m sorry!&#34; she howled, flailing desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guys didn&#39;t even slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton watched her with all the emotion of a marble statue. &#34;Too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys! Help me!&#34; Catherine shrieked, kicking her heels against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys twitched like he was about to sprint after her, but stopped dead when Ashton said, &#34;Walk out now, Mr.Granger, and you make her cause yours. Your name on tonight&#39;s mess. And your name on the Laurent family&#39;s blacklist. Is that what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I swear, I didn&#39;t know anything!&#34; Rhys blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I thought he might still throw himself at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he just looked at Catherine-screaming, heels scraping over marble-and then looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never looked so cowardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys shuffled over to Ashton, fake smile stretched so tight it looked painful. &#34;Mr. Laurent, I actually came here tonight to discuss a potential deal with LGH. I&#39;d never dream of causing trouble at your party. If y/ou might have a moment...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was actually bowing. The desperation stank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t even look up. He lounged in the armchair, scrolling his phone like Rhys was background noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silent treatment hit harder than a slap. Rhys&#39;s face was a shade of red I&#39;d never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he gave up trying to talk business and leaned toward me instead, whispering, &#34;When did you meet Mr.Laurent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;That&#39;s none of your business. Now scram.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw ticked. &#34;Since you know Mr. Laurent... maybe you could, you know, put in a good word later? I&#39;ve got a project I want to pitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot him a look. &#34;And what&#39;s that got to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for my hand. Tight enough to be annoying, not tight enough to leave a mark. &#34;Come on, even if we&#39;re broken up, we&#39;re still friends, right? We grew up together, after all. Besides, whether I marry you or your sister, we&#39;d still end up as family. Our interests align, don&#39;t you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes the sheer stupidity of men is so overwhelming you have no choice but to laugh.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted right in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys Granger, even if we were still together-which, newsflash, we&#39;re not-you think I&#39;d give a damn about your family&#39;s business? Our interests align? I don&#39;t see my name on your company&#39;s stock certificates. You lot could be rolling in gold bars, and I stil wouldn&#39;t see a penny. Why should I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys opened his mouth, then thought better of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smart for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked my hand free and snatched a tissue off the table, scrubbing my wrist like I was wiping off a cockroach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face twisted. It took him some moments before he found speech again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re still pissed about... the fight,&#34; he said, pretending to sound all reasonable.&#34;How about this?I&#39;m free tomorrow. I&#39;ll take you out shopping. Maybe pick a wedding dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Ashton, then lowered his voice. &#34;The invites are already printed. The wedding&#39;s happening,Mira. You can kick and scream all you want, but it&#39;s not getting canceled. Not till my mom...you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently tired of talking to a brick wall, Rhys grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards the door.&#34;Let&#39;s talk outside.&#34;e</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; Ashton looked up from his phone. &#34;Miss Vance is my guest. You can leave. She stays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation:get lost,loser.</p>
