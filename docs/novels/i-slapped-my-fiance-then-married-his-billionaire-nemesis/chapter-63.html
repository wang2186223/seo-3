                <p>My first night at the house passed without incident,and without a single sighting of Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I jolted awake to my alarm before remembering-I&#39;d torched my job at Nyx Collective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was basking in my unemployment glow,someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carmen Alvarez stepped in, followed by what looked like half the staff of Harrods on Black Friday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Racks of clothes, shoe boxes stacked like Jenga towers, handbags, coats, dresses for every season and occasion-all designer, all new, all in my size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll arrange these in the closet,&#34; Carmen said,already directing her team like a runway general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. Really. I don&#39;t need this many clothes. Just send them back,&#34; I said after gawking for a full minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These were selected from Mr. Laurent&#39;s preferred designers. All pieces are custom-ordered for you.Returns aren&#39;t part of the arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was halfway to telling her where to stick the &#34;arrangement&#34; when it hit me-right,the role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s doting wife wouldn&#39;t pitch a fit about couture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pasted on a smile that was more grimace than anything and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Carmen&#39;s crew buzzed around the walk-in,Geoffrey Croft appeared, balancing trays on both arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I sat up straighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trays were lined with velvet boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he had my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey opened one box at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A platinum necklace with Colombian emeralds cut so clean they looked radioactive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cuff bracelet in brushed rose gold with pavédiamonds wrapped in a helix design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One pair of earrings had sapphires so deep and inky they looked like bottled midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The craftsmanship made me want to cry and then steal it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be fresh deliveries every month,&#34; Geoffrey said.&#34;The latest from Mr. Laurent&#39;s usual ateliers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely heard him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands were twitching like a toddler in a toy store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was basically porn for a jewelry designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent the rest of the morning cocooned in my room,surrounded by enough gemstones to fund a minor coup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ashton had walked in right then, I might&#39;ve kissed him to Sunday and back, no questions asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carmen knocked on my door for what had to be the twentieth time, I reluctantly peeled myself off the carpet, where I&#39;d been having a deeply spiritual moment with a tray of diamond chokers, and trudged downstairs for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Post-eggs-and-something-l-couldn&#39;t-pronounce, I headed back to my room and yanked out my old BloomState pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had already been rejected, sure, but I wasn&#39;t ready to bin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I liked it. A lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t some trend-chasing fluff cooked up to impress Eliza.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d poured too much of myself into this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Might as well flesh it out properly, turn it into something real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d already decided when I opened my own jewelry studio,BloomState would be the first line I launched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, the jewelry haul this morning had totally juiced my inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing all those pieces from Cartier, Graff,Boucheron...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like taking a masterclass in stone setting,symmetry,and detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scribbled a few new layout ideas, reworked my bezel placements, fiddled with a hybrid claw tension mount I&#39;d never quite cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Mira, it&#39;s me, Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my favorite lawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted. &#34;Ten bucks says I&#39;m the only lawyer you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha,you caught me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you busy right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun a pencil between my fingers. &#34;Believe it or not,I&#39;m free as a bird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On a Monday morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long story. What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was gonna ask if you could meet later this evening,but if you&#39;re free, want to come down to my office now? It&#39;s about the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve reviewed the stuff I sent you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of it. Audio, video, it&#39;s an absolute goldmine.Since the defamation&#39;s both written and spoken, I&#39;m amending the complaint to include libel and slander.More charges, more damages, as we lawyers like to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| need to go over it all with you-evidence, potential witnesses, rough timeline, damage estimates, the works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like a long meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might be. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll buy you lunch if we go over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey offered to have the car brought around, but I waved him off; I was already feeling like Elly May Clampett from The Beverly Hillbillies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Finn&#39;s office, he looked like something out of &#34;Suits,&#34; all pressed lines and smug competence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, you clean up well,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned.&#34;Court appearance this afternoon. Gotta look the part or the judge assumes I still live with my mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got into the case while a paralegal made notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere between dissecting screenshots and playing a particularly juicy voice memo, we took a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn leaned back. &#34;Gotta say, I was shocked when l found out you and Rhys were a thing. Even more shocked when I heard you weren&#39;t. But after hearing all this,&#34; he gestured at the mountain of evidence I&#39;d brought, &#34;I&#39;m honestly surprised you didn&#39;t dump him sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a rueful laugh. &#34;Yeah, love is blind, deaf,and possibly concussed. Took me forever to realize he wasn&#39;t the man I thought he was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... you single now?&#34; he asked, like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain immediately sprinted to Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And our fake marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the fact that I didn&#39;t have a ring to prove it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must&#39;ve paused too long, because Finn backtracked with a wince. &#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s fine,&#34; I cut in. &#34;I&#39;m not dating anyone right Jewellery Porn now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which, strictly speaking, wasn&#39;t a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn checked his watch. &#34;You hungry? Let&#39;s head out for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>said, grabbing my phone and standing up.&#34;But I&#39;m buying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;Alright, but I&#39;m picking the place.There&#39;s this little bistro near Park &amp; Fifth. They&#39;ve got the best spicy Cacio e Pepe in the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked. &#34;Ha. You remembered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, we slid into a booth at the bistro and ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the waiter left, I leaned back and said, &#34;So.Catch me up. What&#39;s life been like post-graduation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You know my story now. What about yours? Seeing anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Lawyer life&#39;s a black hole. Billing hours kills romance. Plus... I&#39;m waiting for the right girl.&#34;</p>
