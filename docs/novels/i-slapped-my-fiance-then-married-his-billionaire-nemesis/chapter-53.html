                <p>Rhys was chained to a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands cuffed. Ankles shackled. Designer shirt wrinkled beyond salvation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cops had rattled off a laundry list of charges: &#34;Theft. Breaking and entering. Trespassing.Assault. Disturbing the peace. Kidnapping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys screeched, &#34;You&#39;ve got it all wrong! That&#39;s my fiancée! We just had a little lovers&#39; spat, that&#39;s all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the officers didn&#39;t even look up from his notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stole a passcard to Oakwood Apartments. Broke into her flat. Dragged her out against her will. That&#39;s not a spat, Mr. Granger. That&#39;s criminal trespass. And according to our records, she&#39;s not your fiancée. You two broke off the engagement. You&#39;re strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys opened his mouth, closed it, then blinked. Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically true. But still. Bit harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me!&#34; he whined. &#34;I&#39;m the one bleeding!Check out the bruises! I&#39;m the real victim here. Arrest Ashton Laurent while you&#39;re at it-he&#39;s the one who smashed my face in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another officer raised an eyebrow. &#34;Given the circumstances, it looks a lot like self-defense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys groaned like his soul had been kicked in the nuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sagged against the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I at least post bail? I need a hospital. If I stay here any longer, I&#39;m gonna die of internal bleeding or whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll live. Sit tight.&#34; The officer shot him a flat look and left the room with the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, someone upstairs wanted to make an example of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Top-tier treatment, maximum punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way he was getting out any time soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, Clive Granger found out what happened and went absolutely nuclear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out,&#34; he barked at his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No Luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive knew someone was pulling strings behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, yanked on his coat, and decided to grovel in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s how long it took to call in favours, bend over backwards, and kiss arse from one end of Skyline to the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But finally, he got Rhys out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys had barely stepped into the car before Clive slapped him so hard his vision pixelated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Useless piece of shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys, already looking like he&#39;d been thrown down an escalator, clutched his face and whimpered, &#34;Dad,seriously, it wasn&#39;t my fault. Ashton set me up-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth! Drive to the hospital,&#34; he told the driver, then turned back to Rhys with a snarl. &#34;What the hell were you thinking? You picked a fight with Ashton bloody Laurent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys flailed weakly. &#34;I didn&#39;t! He beat the crap out of me unprovoked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know what you were doing at Oakwood?&#34; Clive shot him a glare that could&#39;ve melted steel. &#34;I told you how to spin the story.Direct the heat on Mirabelle. You can&#39;t even do that right!What do I have to do, write you a damn script?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone dropped, serious now. &#34;Leave Mirabelle alone for now. I&#39;m booking you into a hospital. Stay there and heal up. And for the love of God, don&#39;t cause another scandal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,yeah...got it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive hired a full-time nurse to watch over Rhys and very intentionally barred Louisa and Willow from visiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys lay in the hospital bed, staring at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine had been calling him nonstop, leaving increasingly frantic voice messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d replied with a curt &#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; then shut off his phone before she could ask him again if he preferred èze or Nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if he could be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt for him to sit up, to wince, even to spit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more his blood boiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even thrown a punch, and now his whole body felt like it had been run over by a garbage truck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Mirabelle got to waltz around town looking smug,probably/ shopping for her wedding dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the reason Rhys was bleeding, yet somehow,she came out of it squeaky clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage crawled under his skin like ants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screw what his father said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t going down without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys yanked out his phone and opened the group chat with his closest friends, his inner circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys: [Mirabelle ran off with someone else. Wedding&#39;s off.I&#39;m done.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Message sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boom. It was like setting off a grenade in a crowded room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group chat lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Montgomery Hayes was the first to bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monty Hayes: [Wait, what the hell? Mirabelle cheated on you?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More came flooding in:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[She used to follow you around everywhere. What&#39;d you do to piss her off this time?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Didn&#39;t we bet she&#39;d come crawling back in,like,three days? And now she&#39;s run off with someone else?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Is this a joke? @Rhys, did you get blackout drunk again?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys stabbed his thumbs at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys: [I&#39;M NOT drunk. Mirabelle screwed me over.She&#39;s been sneaking around with some random guy.The engagement&#39;s off. So&#39;s the wedding. You can burn the invites.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he was dropping Ashton&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell no. That was suicide by group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he kept it vague.</p>
