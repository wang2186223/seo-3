                <p>Rhys blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked mildly concussed, and maybe he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he snarled, &#34;Why the hell should I? She poured the damn drink on purpose, she hit Catherine,you hit me. Now you want us to say sorry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked around as if searching for support</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad no one was on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every guest was shouting for him to apologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some even pulled out their phones-classic Skyline behavior. Justice via Instagram Live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole body was shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If we&#39;d been alone, I bet he would have swung back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But we weren&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might be stupid, but there was no way he was hitting a woman on camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he used his mouth instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle, who the hell do you think you are? You cheated, you ran off with some other guy, you broke off the engagement. If anyone should apologize, it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;You&#39;re saying I cheated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys went red. Loud red. &#34;Yes! You cheated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re saying I ran off with some random guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn right! You&#39;re heartless. You slept around while we were still together, then dumped me like trash.You&#39;re a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept yelling, his voice cracking, arms flailing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for him to run out of steam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I asked, &#34;So... you got proof of any of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gave him pause. &#34;No... but it&#39;s true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brilliant,&#34; I said,giving my phone a little twirl between my fingers. &#34;Because I recorded all that. Every word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw dropped. &#34;You recorded it? What for?&#34; He sneered. &#34;Gonna cry over it at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;You really are an idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I turned to the crowd behind us and raised my voice just enough. &#34;You all heard that, right? Rhys Granger slandering me at a public event. I&#39;ve already got a lawyer. Consider yourselves witnesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys started sweating. &#34;What the hell are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun back. &#34;I was worried I didn&#39;t have enough to go on. But then you showed up and handed me evidence on a silver platter. Thanks for that, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there gaping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Took him a full ten seconds to reboot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re suing me?&#34; he spluttered. &#34;You seriously think you&#39;ve got the guts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine was whispering under her breath like l couldn&#39;t hear her. &#34;Rhys isn&#39;t totally wrong. You were messing around with some random guy, weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed my phone in her direction. &#34;I recorded that,too. And I&#39;ll be adding your name to the lawsuit. You and Rhys can split the court fees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth snapped shut. Fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys must&#39;ve finally noticed the way everyone was staring at him-like he&#39;d just farted in church-because he grabbed Catherine&#39;s arm and turned to bolt for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oi!&#34; Yvaine shouted after them. &#34;You still owe me for my bloody dress!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept walking like their lives depended on getting the hell out of there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t get far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian Langford stepped in from the side,casual as anything, and blocked their path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nudged Yvaine. &#34;Is he part of your plan, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nudged back. &#34;No. Didn&#39;t even know he was coming today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Granger,&#34; he said,&#34;we&#39;re not quite done here.You&#39;ve yet to apologize, and the dress still hasn&#39;t been paid for. Surely that&#39;s not the way the Grangers handle things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian was smiling, but there was no warmth in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His familiar predator-like expression reminded me of Ashton, and I suddenly understood what Cassian was doing here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might have been dumb enough to piss off Yvaine but even he wasn&#39;t suicidal enough to cross a Langford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s dad, Clive, basically bowed when he saw Cassian at corporate events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Langford, you saw what happened,&#34; Rhys tried. &#34;It was Yvaine and Mirabelle who got physical. Catherine and I were the victims.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually sounded like he believed that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then call the police,&#34; Cassian said. &#34;I don&#39;t care about the scuffle. That&#39;s for the court to sort out. But you&#39;re not denying that your girlfriend here&#34;-he tilted his chin at Catherine-&#34;ruined Yvaine&#39;s dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not my girlfriend,&#34; Rhys said in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine looked like she wanted to say something but Rhys shut her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Will you at least acknowledge that she&#39;s your date? You did show up to the party with her, didn&#39;t you?&#34;Cassian glanced at the photographer Yvaine had hired.&#34;If you need help jogging your memory...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need! Yeah, she&#39;s my... date,&#34; Rhys admitted reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I imagine fifteen grand isn&#39;t beyond the Grangel family budget?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys could definitely afford it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But handing over the money would mean admitting Yvaine and I had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was an accident,&#34; he tried vainly.d Yvaine ruined Cathy&#39;s dress, too. Maybe we should just call it even?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear Granger Development Group is bidding on that Redwood Creek redevelopment project? I happen to have friends who are sitting on the City Planning Commission...&#34; Cassian didn&#39;t need to finish the sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys got the hint fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he fumbled that deal over a dress, his dad would actually murder him with a caviar spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll pay,&#34; Rhys blurted. &#34;Of course we&#39;ll pay. It&#39;s all a misunderstanding, just a stupid dress...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Catherine a look that basically screamed: pay up or I will drown you in the punch bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him that wide-eyed, damsel-in-distress stare, hoping he&#39;d swoop in and save her wallet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Catherine, transfer the money. Now.&#34;&#34;But, Rhys!&#34; she whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys didn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, with half the room watching, Catherine pulled out her phone and tapped through the transfer Yvaine&#39;s phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the screen, saw the money had landed.and gave a tiny nod. &#34;You&#39;re free to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys and Catherine slithered out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine looked disappointed. &#34;I&#39;ve got more stuff planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;Maybe next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looped her arm through mine. &#34;Come on, now it&#39;s time for the real party. Also, where&#39;s your boyfriend?I did send Ashton an invite, didn&#39;t l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not my boyfriend,&#34; I said automatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine grinned. &#34;Sure, sure. Because he&#39;s obviously much more than that now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in,eyes gleaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen it too many times not to brace for impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to squirm away, but she was fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So? How&#39;s married life treating you? You climb that man yet or what? What position did you use? Were you on top or-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bolted for the bathroom before her questions got even more X-rated.</p>
