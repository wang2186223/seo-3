                <p>Dominic waited until Mirabelle Vance disappeared down the street before heading back in, the laundry bag dangling from his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front desk, one of the reception girls stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dom, who was that just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to play it casual, but he could see the regret all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d clearly thought Mirabelle was a nobody earlier and now wanted a do-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t give her name. Is she really here to see the big boss? How come she doesn&#39;t have an appointment? I thought-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop asking so many questions,&#34; Dominic said, barely slowing down. &#34;Next time she shows up, don&#39;t make her wait. Let her through straightaway. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl swallowed. &#34;Y-yeah. Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic hit the lift and rode up to thesixty-eighth floor, where the C-suite had their offices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His boss was standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic wasn&#39;t sure if he was watching the skyline or tracking Mirabelle&#39;s movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed the laundry bag on a nearby coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss. I said everything you told me to. Dropped enough pressure on her to make her nervous. She&#39;s definitely thinking now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was calm, but his eyes had that look again-sharp, locked in, like he was already planning how to corner her next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His personal phone lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic checked the caller ID. &#34;Boss, it&#39;s your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton turned around, took the phone, and answered,&#34;What.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what I want to ask,&#34; Reginald snapped. &#34;You walked out of your own damn party. The one meant to introduce you to every major player in Skyline. Half the city&#39;s still buzzing about it. Do you realize the media&#39;s gone feral?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not my problem.&#34; Ashton leaned back against the glass, fingers drumming on the window ledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re LGH&#39;s CEO. Every damn twitch you make rattles our stock. I happen to own some of it, you know.This affects me,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then maybe diversify.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald ignored that. &#34;They&#39;re saying you collapsed. Or that LGH is sinking and you&#39;ve fled the wheel.I haven&#39;t slept since. Been running PR interference, trying to slap a gag order on some of the more outrageous stories floating out there. You know, you could&#39;ve given me a heads-up before pulling a vanishing act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t owe anyone an explanation. Least of all the jackals circling for a quote. The people who mattered got a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some of those &#39;jackals&#39; are long-time partners. Investors. Businessmen who flew in from three time zones away to shake your hand. They were left with hors d&#39;oeuvres and no heir in sight. Do you think that&#39;s good for business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll live. And if they want to keep doing business with LGH, they&#39;ll get over it. Let&#39;s not pretend the economy&#39;s doing great. We&#39;re the last ship worth boarding. They need us more than we need them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Reginald tried a new angle. &#34;Fine, You handle the business. But what about the girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw ticked. &#34;What about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one you said we&#39;d meet but didn&#39;t. What am I supposed to say to your grandfather? He&#39;s convinced he&#39;s got one foot in the grave. He wants awedding. A great-grandkid. Gwen and I were supposed to meet the girl,and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Il talk to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut Reginald up for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he conceded, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll leave that to you,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, don&#39;t hang up yet!&#34; Reginald&#39;s voice changed, awkward and slippery. &#34;There&#39;s... an opportunity.Some new fund. Hedge-adjacent. I&#39;d need some liquidity to get in early-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just hear me out-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Ashton didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;You said that with the golf resort in North Korea. It tanked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that too, about the cryotherapy chain. Which, last I checked, froze your assets into near bankruptcy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither was the NFT art gallery. Remember that? The one that &#39;just needed influencer traction&#39; and ended up being a PowerPoint scam with a domain hosted on GoDaddy.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright. I got your point. But I&#39;m your father and I could use-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might consider helping you,&#34; Ashton said coolly, &#34;if you keep your wife from treating me like the finalrose on The Bachelor. I don&#39;t need another list of &#39;eligible&#39; daughters from the Manhattan Yacht Club. Or a random heiress texting me at 3 a.m. because Gwendolyn has given out my number without my permission,again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald sighed. &#34;She&#39;s just trying to help. You&#39;re.almost thirty-one and still single. She wants to see you settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll settle when I want. What I need now is for her to stop bleeding money on events no one remembers and clothes she&#39;ll never wear. You rein her in, maybe I write a cheque. No promises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.I&#39;H talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic stepped in, arms full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss. These are flowers from Miss Grey. Concert tickets from a-uh-Miss Kendra Lucille? Gift baskets from... Miss Yvette Summers, Miss Liliana Hart, and Miss Noemi Bancroft. Oh, and this...&#34; He set down a long velvet case. &#34;An antique flintlock from Miss Desiree Lang. Guess she heard about your little shooting club phase in Switzerland.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t even glance at the pile.&#34;Chuck the flowers. Tickets go to whichever secretary fixes the office printer. Gift baskets-food goes to the staff. Whatever can&#39;t be eaten, sell it online. Donate the money to a children&#39;s charity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic grinned. &#34;On it, boss. Can I keep one of the concert tckets? I happen to like the band.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, boss.&#34; Dominic turned to leave, then paused.&#34;Oh. The safe you ordered has arrived. Installed five minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Ashton opened the drawer behind him and pulled out a small velvet box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flicked it open with one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside sat a necklace. Clean lines, high-contrast design, platinum sharp as a whisper.</p>
