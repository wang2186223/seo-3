                <p>As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and raw-they&#39;d been sleeping together behind my back all along. And me? I was just the foolish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I couldn&#39;t figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes stung.I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. Catherine&#39;s back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and1...1was finally free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira... I&#39;m so sorry. I had no idea they&#39;d be there tonight. I didn&#39;t even know Catherine was back.&#34;Yvaine&#39;s eyes were full of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. &#34;Neither did But I heard it loud and clear-they&#39;ve been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those goddamn assholes!&#34; Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth. &#34;You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine&#39;s not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys&#39;s parents? No way they&#39;ll tolerate a scandal like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys&#39;s parents were the only people who had supported me.But he was their son. They wouldn&#39;t choose me over him. Not in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired.&#34;You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I&#39;ll never replace her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine grabbed my shoulders, worry darkening her gaze. &#34;So what now? You&#39;re just going to let them humiliate you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; My voice dropped to a whisper, a weariness weighing it down. &#34;Maybe if I accept it, it&#39;ll finally be over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Yvaine&#39;s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her brows knitting in frustration. &#34;Mira, my agent just called. There&#39;s a last-minute ad shoot-1have to go now. Can you get home on your own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, managing a faint smile.&#34;Go. Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll call when I get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she left, I hailed a cab. Instinctively, I gave the driver my home address. But barely two minutes into  the ride, a wave of suffocating pressure settled over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, wait,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;Take me to a bar. Any bar.Just... far away from Roxanne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver didn&#39;t blink-clearly used to the erratic demands of Skyline City&#39;s broken-hearted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We eventually pulled up outside some unfamiliar nightclub. Velvet ropes. A crowd of influencer-types wielding selfie sticks. I didn&#39;t bother checking the name. I handed the bouncer some bills and strode inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straight to the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whiskey sour. Large. Keep them coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, maybe you should slow down,&#34; the bartender said gently, concern in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed my empty glass on the counter and shoved my card across. &#34;Did I stutter? Top me off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender sighed but obliged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That guy&#39;s right,&#34; a smooth, magnetic voice murmured beside me. &#34;Too much alcohol can impair cognitive function and judgment. Unless you want to wake up in a stranger&#39;s bed tonight-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned, irritated-then froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man from last night. My new neighbor. The one who&#39;d handed me my keys with all the casual elegance of a Renaissance statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well. You again.&#34; I raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at my lips. &#34;You really can&#39;t resist other people&#39;s business, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled softly, completely unfazed. &#34;Think of it as a well-developed instinct for being helpful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave an exaggerated sigh. &#34;You&#39;re a hero, truly. But I don&#39;t need saving, Mr. Key Man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he said calmly, lifting his glass and taking a slow sip. His eyes were clear and sharp. &#34;But you do seem in desperate need of clarity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;&#39;Is this how you treat all your neighbors?First their keys, then their dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed-a low, rich sound. &#34;Only when the neighbor looks like she&#39;s on the verge of self-destruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...But I am always self-destructing,&#34; | muttered,suddenly quieter. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it seem kind of pathetic?Like my whole life is just one mess after another?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t laugh. He didn&#39;t rush to reassure me,either.He didn&#39;t even deny what I&#39;d just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just looked at me. Calm. Quiet.Like he was watching a slow-motion disaster unfold-but had no intention of stopping it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong,&#34; he finally said, his voice low and steady. &#34;You are pretty good at making a mess of things. Like right now-you can&#39;t even stand properly and you&#39;re still demanding more alcohol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze,frowning instinctively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he went on, his tone unhurried-like he was flipping through a book and had landed on a sentence he already knew by heart:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But strangely, you always seem to meet someone who refuses to walk away... right before everything falls apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, half in shock, half in suspicion. you...flirting with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a slow smile, his eyes lazily curving with just the right amount of mischief. His voice came out smooth and provocative, like velvet wrapped around steel. &#34;Does it make you feel any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low and warm, like whiskey being poured into a glass at midnight-just a little dizzying,just a little dangerous. He looked at me with an intensity that felt nearly uncontrollable, like he might lean in close and whisper things in the dark, on a bed,asking if his touch was hard enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. My cheeks flushed instantly.My fingertips tightened against the edge of the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to look at him properly. Really see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That face-it wasn&#39;t just handsome. It had the kind of quiet,devastating maturity that no amount of cologne and hair gel could fake. Not the kind you&#39;d find among the over-groomed boys who danced to house music like they were owed the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\A wild, uninvited thought flashed through my mind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I let him walk awvay tonight, maybe I was rejecting one of those rare, merciful moments when fate offered a second chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop myself, my hand wrapped around the sleeve of his suit jacket. I rose from the barstool,heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Mr.Keys,&#34; I said, my voice hoarse but firm, &#34;since you&#39;re so committed to helping... why not help all the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clearly hadn&#39;t expected that. His brow lifted slightly, surprise flickering across his face-but he didn&#39;t step back. He didn&#39;t laugh. He simply said, calm and steady:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. As long as this is something you won&#39;t deny when you&#39;re sober.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure.&#34; | answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping his wrist tighter, I pulled him through the crowd and out of the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night wind struck us like a cleansing slap, city lights flickering above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let myself pause. No time to think, no space for regret</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We crossed the street. Entered the nearest hotel lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because tonight, I needed to know if I had the courage to accept what fate had placed in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It must have been one hell of a night, because when I woke up, sunlight was spilling through the curtains,and the red LED numbers of the digital clock blinked 10:07 AM at me with the judgmental smugness of a nun catching you sneaking out of the church.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheets still carried his scent-bergamot and sin-and my body buzzed from the lingering aftershocks of what we&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the ceiling and thought: That was absolutely phenomenal sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind that wrecks you, delights you, and makes you stupid enough to want another round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ached everywhere-in the best, most regrettable way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my head... my head was a battlefield. It felt like a hundred tiny jackhammers were drilling through my skull. The alcohol from last night had declared mutiny,and my brain was paying the price, like someone had jammed a red-hot poker through my temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea how much | drank-definitely more than I should&#39;ve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The details had vanished into a fog thicker than a London morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Groaning, I rolled out of bed. Groaned again. Began gathering the scattered pieces of my clothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan was simple: Get dressed. Sneak out. Pretend this never happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just picked up my skirt when a voice stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leaving so soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned-very slowly, thanks to the hangover and the shame-and saw him standing in the bathroom doorway,a towel slung low on his hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Droplets clung to his abs, catching the morning light,trailing down the deep V of his torso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared. Unashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images from the night before surged back into my brain. I suddenly felt... very, very thirsty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; he said.</p>
