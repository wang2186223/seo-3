                <p>Chaos was breaking out, but Yvaine wasn&#39;t exactly losing. She&#39;d landed a kick on everyone who came near,even knocked one guy flat on his arse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All those kickboxing classes are finally paying off.&#34; She even had the time to gloat to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Rhys finally decided to show up, fresh from whatever mirror he&#39;d been admiring himself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took one look at the scene and his face went from &#34;Skyline City heartthrob&#34; to &#34;incoming category/five hurricane&#34; in half a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle! What the hell are you doing? If you&#39;re pissed off, take it out on me! Leave Catherine out of it!&#34;he snapped, storming towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving fast, he grabbed my wrist, trying to yank my hand out of Catherine&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t letting go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stay out of it!&#34; I snapped, tightening my grip. &#34;You just assume it&#39;s my fault without even asking,yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re literally dragging Catherine around by her hair! Am I supposed to pretend I&#39;m blind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was full of Skyline&#39;s top-tier elite-the type of people Rhys used to stalk on Linkedln and now desperately wanted to impress. His ego must&#39;ve been melting faster than an ice cream on a July pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, naturally, he took it out on me, yanking my arm so hard I thought my bones would snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely had time to swear before a hand clamped down on Rhys&#39;s arm. Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys stiffened. &#34;Who the hell-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton ripped Rhys&#39;s hand off me like peeling gum off a shoe and took hold of my wrist.&#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he was glaring at Rhys, you&#39;d think he was two seconds away from breaking every bone in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down. A bright red mark was blooming across my wrist like some godawful brand. Fantastic. Just what I needed-battle scars from my ex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton saw it too. His eyes narrowed. He shot Rhys a look so cold it could&#39;ve frozen the Hudson. Rhys actually flinched, breaking into a nervous sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stood there, dumb as a lamppost, while Ashton led me upstairs without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted some guy in a suit storming towards Yvaine, with a swarm of security guards on his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me! Not my fault!&#34; Yvaine shrieked. &#34;Everyone saw it! Rhys has been cheating, parading his side chick around like it&#39;s spring break, and they ganged up on Mira! The wedding&#39;s off! And it&#39;s not Mira&#39;s fault she&#39;s bailing-it&#39;s because Rhys is a lying piece of shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get to my friend,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll be fine,&#34; Ashton said curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the guy in the suit barking orders at the guards, waving them towards the knot of people crowding Yvaine. They waded in, peeling the mob off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine was still on her feet, looking pissed but perfectly fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton added, &#34;They&#39;re coming this way. Don&#39;t worry, your friend&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No time to argue. His grip on my wrist was firm but not rough, dragging me into a side room that looked like a private lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, the suit came barging in, hauling Yvaine by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raked a hand through his immaculately groomed hair and barked at her,&#34;Right. Start talking. What the hell happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine grabbed a napokin and started dabbing at her wine-soaked dress. She launched into a play-by-play of the mess downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she ranted, Ashton brought out a med kit, his hand surprisingly gentle as he dabbed antiseptic on my wrist. His touch was careful,almost...reverent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The iodine burned slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it was the worst part. The real problem was how bloody close he was. Ashton was half-kneeling in front of me, breath ghosting over my skin, and between the sting and the heat of him, my whole arm was ready to catch fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked over me, sharp and thorough, like he was scanning for damage. I felt stripped bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked my hand back and shrugged like it was no big deal. &#34;I&#39;m fine, really. I box, you know. If it had come down to it, those girls wouldn&#39;t have stood a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pushed himself upright, grabbed his phone, and made a call. When it connected, he said, &#34;Pull the security footage from the first floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked on Yvaine, blotting at the giant wine stain on her designer dress. The guy in the suit hovered nearby,passing me tissues like he was trying to make himself useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That dress is a goner,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ll tell the housekeeper to bring you a fresh one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine waved it off. &#34;The dress is fine. If you hadn&#39;t dragged me off, I swear I would&#39;ve roasted Rhys into a permanent meme!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she shot me an apologetic wince and said, &#34;Mira, about me yelling the whole engagement&#39;s off in public-you&#39;re not mad, right? It just sort of...slipped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;I&#39;m not mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked over at Ashton. &#34;I didn&#39;t realise you&#39;d arrived. You were upstairs this whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when fists were flying and glasses were smashing, I hadn&#39;t missed it. Ashton had appeared from the second floor, not the front entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say anything, the guy in the suit cut in, &#34;Why can&#39;t he be upstairs? He lives here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at Ashton. &#34;You live here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine butted in too, eyes flicking between the guy in the suit and Ashton.&#34;Wait, you two know each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy nodded. &#34;Duh. We&#39;ve been friends for ages. That&#39;s Ashton Laurent. Just got back from Europe.This whole party&#39;s for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nearly fell over. &#34;Ashton Laurent? You told me your name was Ashton Girard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Yvaine screeched too: &#34;Ashton? Mira, this is your new fiancé?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton, calm as a dead heart monitor, said to mne, &#34;Girard&#39;s my mum&#39;s surname. Laurent&#39;s my dad&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friend&#39;s jaw hit the floor. &#34;Wait, what? You&#39;re engaged?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton side-eyed him. &#34;This party is to announce it. Didn&#39;t you get the memo?&#34;</p>
