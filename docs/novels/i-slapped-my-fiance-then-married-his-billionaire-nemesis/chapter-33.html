                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyingly persuasive silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated how tempted I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys Granger used to be the guy every woman in Skyline had on her dream board. Me included, back whenl didn&#39;t know he was a full-time bastard. Catherine, Serenna-hell, we were all drunk on the fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now Ashton Laurent was the real obsession. Not just the last name-though, yeah, being a Laurent definitely opened doors-but the man himself. The brains, the backbone, the unnerving calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying him would be the ultimate power move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And unlike the other preening, entitled bachelors, he actually acted like a decent human being. Every time we&#39;d crossed paths, he&#39;d been polite,respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which made him even more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, if I had to pick someone out of everyone I knew, he was the safest bet by a mile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was the bit that didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d barely seen each other. A few run-ins, some short conversations, and, yes, one wild night together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nothing remotely close to &#34;hey, let&#39;s-ruin our lives together&#34; territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why the hell was he offering to marry me like it was no big deal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could have anyone. Literally anyone. There were women in Skyline who&#39;d trample their own sisters to get his number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I have that made me wife materia in Ashton Laurent&#39;s billionaire brain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him and straight up asked,&#34;Why me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t have to be a permanent situation. If things don&#39;t work out, we can split after a year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes. &#34;That&#39;s not what I asked.I said-why me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth curled slightly. &#34;Doesn&#39;t have to be you. You&#39;re right, l&#39;ve got options, and I&#39;m guessing you do too. But out of all the people we could have dragged into a pretend marriage, I&#39;m still your best pick. That&#39;s why you came to me in the first place, yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Vance, I&#39;m not playing house. This wouldn&#39;t be some cutesy charade. It&#39;d be a real, legal marriage.With paperwork. With rings. You&#39;d have a marriage certificate and a title that means something. And with that, you can tell Mrs. Granger to back off, and your family to shove their matchmaking plans. You&#39;d finally have the upper hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused just long enough to make it clear he wasn&#39;t bluffing. &#34;Think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no clue how I made it back to Oakwood Apartments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Ashton had dropped me at my doorstep, then headed back to the office like he didn&#39;t need sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unlocked my door, stumbled to the sofa, and flopped down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words wouldn&#39;t stop replaying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your best option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there, staring into nothing, trying to digest the world&#39;s weirdest proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage.Real marriage. Not the fake kind. This was legit, legal, and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if we were just putting on a show for our families, it&#39;d still be a show with contracts and paperwork and probably a joint tax return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed a buffer from his family. I needed to shut down Louisa and her delusions. Fine. Strategic partnership, one-year term, no sex, no drama. Easy,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told myself it was fine. Totally fine. Very normal to consider marrying a man I barely knew just to get my life back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t help that my brain had turned into a courtroom. One tiny lawyer-me was screaming &#34;Run!&#34;; the other one was already drawing up the prenup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bickered so loudly in my head I thought I might throw something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay sprawled like a zombie for a bit, then gave up trying to think and stumbled into the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two minutes later I was face-planted in bed, lights still on, hair still damp, consciousness entirely gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I got to Nyx Collective the next morning, I looked semi-human.Barely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whole flock of interns had formed a human shrine around Violet Lin, who was basking in the attention and waving her hands around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Laurent party was insane. I swear, the road was lined with luxury cars. Only the crème de la crème of Skyline City even got through the gates... Obviously, I was on the guest list. Oh, and I talked to the heir,you know, the one who just got back from overseas? He&#39;s hotter than any actor. I mean, movie-star jawline, a killer bod. You get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get it. Or care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swerved around the Violet fan club and headed straight for my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she spotted me, her whole vibe shifted. Her smile twitched. She continued her story but kept glancing over at me like I might jump up and shout &#34;You lie!&#34; any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t say anything, she relaxed. Her shoulders dropped, her voice got louder, and the fake stories flowed like boxed wine at an office party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried sketching.Five design drafts, all garbage. I gave up after I realized draft six looked suspiciously like Ashton&#39;s face and headed for the break room, hunting for caffeine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his voice followed me there like a persistent ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your best option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked and realized the water dispenser was overflowing. I fumbled to turn it off before the flood reached my shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got you so spaced out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped, nearly launching the bloody cup across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet was leaning against the door jamb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked her tongue. &#34;Seriously? It was an innocent question. You look like you just got caught burying a body. You up to something shady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer. Just grabbed some napkins, wiped down the counter, and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; Violet blocked my path. &#34;Didn&#39;t you hear me talking to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to talk about.&#34; I didn&#39;t even slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our mutual fake-nice era was very much over, and I wasn&#39;t interested in reruns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she stepped in front of me again and hissed in a low voice,&#34;You&#39;d better keep what happened at the Laurent party to yourself. Don&#39;t go running your mouth to the others,got it?&#34;</p>
