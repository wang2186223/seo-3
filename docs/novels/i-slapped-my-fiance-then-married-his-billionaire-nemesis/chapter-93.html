                <p>Her bra and panties were soaked through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a good idea to leave them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle squirmed when he reached for the bra clasp, but his voice cut through the fog again-low, steady,close to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me. Ashton.You&#39;re safe now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched, then she went still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stripped off the last of the soaked fabric, toweled her off again, and reached for the change of clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A white dress shirt and suit trousers, both at least two sizes too big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wvere women in the house-his brother&#39;s wife, his stepmother-but the idea of Mirabelle wearing anything of theirs made something primal crawl under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped the shirt over her shoulders, buttoned it up, rolled the cuffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trousers he folded at the waist and cinched loosely with one of his ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she&#39;d wandered out of his closet half-asleep, hair damp, skin flushed, drowning in layers of fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were barely open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was somewhere else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stood and shifted his weight, running a hand over his collar like it was strangling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His own suit was drenched and clinging to him, but he didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Mirabelle&#39;s breathing began to even out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes stopped twitching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t shivering as much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid returned with a hairdryer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took it, set it to the lowest and least noisy setting, and gently worked through her hair with his fingers as the warm air blew softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle didn&#39;t let go of his shirt the entire time, her hand clenched in the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another maid stepped in, balancing a tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the hot chocolate you asked for, Mr.Laurent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed by her side, her fingers still twisted in his shirt, murmuring to her under his breath. Over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, her shivering stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curled into the blanket he&#39;d tucked around her and didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stood, eyes scanning her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked young like this. Defenseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely recognizable as the woman who&#39;d once dragged him off a bar stool and hauled him into the nearest hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the maid. &#34;Stay with her. If she wakes up, get her anything she asks for. And inform me immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Mr.Laurent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered for a second longer, then walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another room, he changed into a fresh suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing at the top of the staircase landing, he surveyed the crowd below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin was flapping a towel.uselessly around a woman, who sat on a sofa, dripping, face pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had clearly taken a dip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hair soaked, dress plastered to her skin, mascara running down in tiny rivulets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But otherwise, her breathing was easy, her eyes clear, her voice functional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stepped into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd silenced instantly, then shifted, parting without being asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel stood up immediately, her spine snapping straight, an automatic response of most people when they met Ashton face to face for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent,&#34; she said with wide eyes and forced concern, &#34;how&#39;s Mirabelle? I hope she&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s resting.&#34; His tone could have iced a cocktail.&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated the little monologue she&#39;d just fed the others-high school, old friends, catching up, slippery tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must&#39;ve panicked,&#34; Isobel added, wringing her fingers. &#34;When she slipped, she just grabbed for me.I don&#39;t think she even realized it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin eased forward gingerly. &#34;Ashton, um, can l use one of the rooms upstairs? Isobel&#39;s soaked through.She&#39;s freezing. I want her to change into something dry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t look at him. &#34;Just a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he pivoted back to the star of the sob story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re telling me Mirabelle pulled you into the water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel blinked rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted, but no sound came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second too long passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave an involuntary shudder, this time not from the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean... I guess she did, sort of. She was probably just startled. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t intentional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes slid away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s fingers twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to physically drag the truth out of her was visceral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it sat there, humming under his skin like static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Mirabelle here, Isobel must have thought she could spin whatever tale she liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe with someone else, it would have worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ashton trusted Mirabelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she&#39;d been half-drowned and half-delirious, he trusted her more than he&#39;d ever trust a stranger wrapped in a damp towel and bad acting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure that&#39;s what happened?&#34; he asked, giving her one last chance to come clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel missed it completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers clutched at the terry cloth. &#34;Yeah, I think so. I mean, it all happened so fast...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I pull the surveillance footage, will it back up your version?&#34; Ashton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know the cameras had been turned off at the request of a few privacy-obsessed guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Ashton wasn&#39;t about to enlighten her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel turned to Quentin with a desperate look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ventured, &#34;Ashton, why don&#39;t we deal with this later, yeah? Let&#39;s get Isobel upstairs before she catches pneumonia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can leave when she answers the question,&#34; Ashton said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes never left her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will the tape back you up? Or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked.Fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe could almost see the internal map in her mind, scrambling to remember where the cameras were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t fill the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just stared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She buckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flinch behind the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slight hitch in her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a fraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty centimeters, maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel jolted like she&#39;d been shocked, stumbled back onto the sofa without meaning to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat worked around words that never made it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin dropped into a crouch beside her, resting one hand on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even he looked uneasy now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, honey,&#34; he said, voice a notch too high.&#34;Just tell Ashton what you saw, then we can go get you changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel licked her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small voice piped up from the far side of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw what happened!&#34;</p>
