                <p>&#34;Fake, of course.&#34; I caught the faintest trace of a smile as he answered. &#34;And arranged partnerships for mutual benefit happen more often than you think.We&#39;re just skipping the dinner dates and going straight to the paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he gestured for me to sit down, pulled out a sleek black notebook, and began listing terms. Like this was a bloody,client meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat through the whole thing in a fog, nodding along as we discussed timelines, appearances, and what counted as acceptable hand-holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one point, he used the phrase &#39;public intimacy quotient,&#39; and I had to fight the urge to check if this was all some elaborate prank being livestreamed on TikTok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after we shook on it, I still felt like I&#39;d slipped into an alternate reality where men agreed to fake marriages without blinking, and I somehow wasn&#39;t being scammed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a party in three days,&#34; he said casually, like it was no big deal. &#34;I&#39;ll need you there. It&#39;s time to announce our engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, looking at me with that same predatory &#34;And I&#39;ll do the same for you, with your family. Let&#39;s give them a show they won&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left his apartment in a daze, drifted back to mine like I&#39;d just been abducted by aliens and dropped back on Earth without the instruction manual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when I slid into a booth across from Yvaine at our usual dinner spot, I stilI felt like I&#39;d accidentally wandered out of my own body and into someone else&#39;s wildly overdramatic Netflix show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Earth to Mira.&#34; Yvaine waved her hand in front of my face. &#34;You look like someone just told you your flat&#39;s been repossessed by a cult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked myself back to consciousness and gave her the rundown: getting fired from the coffeehouse,my mother&#39;s role in it, the continued repercussions of cutting ties with Rhys-everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine&#39;s face scrunched up as if she&#39;d just tasted battery acid. She let out a string of expletives sO colorful it could&#39;ve qualified as abstract art, most of them directed at my mother. I politely ignored the part where she called Caroline a &#39;fire-breathing dementor in a Chanel suit.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not why I called you,&#34; I said, waving away the job thing. &#34;You know I couldn&#39;t care less about the barista job. I mean, yes, RIP to my 40% staff discount,but that&#39;s where the mourning ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still,&#34; Yvaine huffed,&#34;&#39;that&#39;s no excuse for what Caroline pulled. I mean, does she wake up and choose villainy every morning or is it a spontaneous thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could continue her spirited campaign to have my mother tried for emotional war crimes, I hit her with the real headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve, uh... sort of gotten engaged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine froze mid-sip. Her eyes went so wide | was half-worried they&#39;d roll right out of her head and into her cappuccino.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve gone back to Rhys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God, no.&#34; I made a face like she&#39;d just suggested l marry my cousin. &#34;This is worse. Or better? I don&#39;t even know anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I launched into the full saga: my mother trying to auction me off to Skyline City&#39;s edition of Daddy Warbucks, my desperate bluff about already having a more powerful fiancé, and how I somehow ended up convincing my absurdly hot neighbor-who also happened to be my rebound one-night stand-to go along with the madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine didn&#39;t interrupt once. Her eyes just kept getting bigger until I was convinced she was morphing into a human bush baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; she finally said, after a long pause and possibly some internal screaming. &#34;Now I&#39;m dying to meet this mystery man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will. There&#39;s a party in three days. He wants to make the engagement public. You know, the usual fake fiancé PR package. I&#39;ve got you an invite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine nodded slowly, as if her brain was still buffering.Then she raised her coffee mug. &#34;I suppose this calls for a celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a fake engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but no one else knows that, do they? Besides, I&#39;m not celebrating that. I&#39;m celebrating the fact that you&#39;ve finally told Caroline where to shove it. And that you&#39;re officially free from Rhys, the walking red flag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clinked my mug&#39;against hers. &#34;I&#39;ll drink to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And we did. Then we smiled at each other. Yvaine had this uncanny talent for turning total chaos into a party theme. With her around, even my absolute train wreck of a life felt kind of... fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This calls for wine, not caffeine,&#34; she declared,snapping her fingers at a passing waiter. &#34;Bring us the wine list!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was shaping up to be a properly celebratory afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right up until Rhys waltzed into the same bloody restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Catherine hanging off his arm like a Dior handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swanned over to our table, gave us this wide-eyed look of manufactured surprise, and said, &#34;Oh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira? I didn&#39;t expect to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say anything remotely scathing, she leaned in just enough to seem intimate and murmured,&#34;Mum mentioned you&#39;re seeing someone now...an older gentleman, wasn&#39;t it? Mr. Shaw, I think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it casually, but her eyes flicked to Rhys, like she wanted to make sure he was catching every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sigh, soft, almost regretful. &#34;I believe he&#39;s been through, what... four divorces?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let that hang in the air just long enough to stíng,then added, with this serene, saintly little smile, &#34;But of course, to each their own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was all indulgent big sister, the kind who wouldn&#39;t dream of judging your choices out loud-though she was clearly dying to hand you a pamphlet titled Why You&#39;re Doing It All Wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s expression shifted like someone had just told him his stocks had tanked. He looked straight at me,eyes all moody and brooding, and demanded, &#39;So this is why you ended the engagement?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I briefly considered baptizing them both in merlot,but this place was far too classy for that kind of scene.Also, I really didn&#39;t want to end up on a viral TikTok titled &#39;Local Woman Loses It in Midtown Bistro.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine crossed her arms, eyes blazing, and sneered at Rhys as if she was seconds away from launching her drink at his face. &#34;You of all damn people know exactly why Mira ended the engagement. Don&#39;t you dare stand there and play the victim you&#39;re not fooling anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a disappointed look. &#34;You know, I used to think you were better than this. Turns out I was giving you way too much credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she tilted her chin towards Catherine with a cold little smirk. &#34;You two really are a perfect match. Trash finds trash, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s face went redder than the merlot in my glass.&#34;Say that again and your modeling career&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when I&#39;d had enough.</p>
