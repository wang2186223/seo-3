                <p>For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets,and the crushing weight of humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That slap from Rhys wasn&#39;t just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a slap across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing.It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I&#39;d ever done to make him notice me,everything I&#39;d done for a fantasy called &#34;us&#34; that had never truly existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God,where do l even begin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he&#39;d once praised. My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, &#34;It&#39;s fine-some allergic reactions are worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning howv to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain. He didn&#39;t even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me,&#34;Don&#39;t bother next time. I don&#39;t like sweets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was that night at his friend&#39;s dinner party.I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem &#34;graceful and agreeable.&#34; I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m.He didn&#39;t ask if I was ok&lt;ay. He laughed and said, &#34;Can&#39;t even handle seafood? That&#39;s just dramatic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the worst?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party. I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, &#34;Don&#39;t pretend to like things you clearly don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I laughed. I laughed and said, &#34;You&#39;ve got such a good memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the &#34;perfect and untouchable&#34; Catherine. A cheap stand-in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook.Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn&#39;t contacted me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he&#39;d done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it didn&#39;t stop ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full five minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed.&#34;What the hell happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; | said,trying to sound casual. She wasn&#39;t buying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind.The kind that comes right before something explodes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who hit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come inside,&#34; I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors&#39; attention. That would be mortifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine didn&#39;t move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. &#34;Mira. Who.Hit.You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn&#39;t the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone. One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation,money,status-he had it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex. When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Scotch in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People called him arrogant. No one ever called him violent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why, when Yvaine processed what I&#39;d just said,I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way,&#34; she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. &#34;Rhys?Your Rhys? He couldn&#39;t have...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>untouchable good guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was him,&#34; I said quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. &#34;Tell me what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed. &#34;I was at his place. l, uh... accidentally broke a mug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire body tensed. &#34;Just a mug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, &#34;I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted,one-of-a-kind family heirloom-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Catherine&#39;s mug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine&#39;s hand froze mid-pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. &#34;It&#39;s over between Rhys and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn&#39;t marry him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stopped her from storming out to commit homicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Catherine. That venomous snake-&#34; Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her. &#34;She&#39;s not even here anymore and she&#39;s still managing to wreck your life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they&#39;d hand her the matches. It&#39;s unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated,exhausted.That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my chest. I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing l could do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile. &#34;Actually, I think it&#39;s a good thing. At least I found out,what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. &#34;Mira,you know no matter what happens, I&#39;ve got your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you&#39;d be like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed.What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the half-open door,I heard her on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t catch every word, but the ones I did hear..were iconic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A pile of shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Total fucking psycho.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you think that&#39;s bad? Wait till I tell you what this violent bastard actually did-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t something she did lightly. Rhys&#39;s family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable.And I had no doubt her parents wouldn&#39;t be thrilled to see her go up against them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t my parents love me like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini&#39;d her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn&#39;t mean they forgave my existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let&#39;s be honest: the only reason they&#39;d stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys. That little arrangement somehow elevated me from &#34;irreparable family disgrace&#34; tootential saving grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and know how pathetic this sounds-was because | thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection. A crumb of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that the engagement was off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was disposable again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I&#39;d spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were absolutely capable of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned into my pillow. What the hell do I do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless... I married,someone more powerful than Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A face flashed in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days ago. My new neighbor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking l wouldn&#39;t mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought.I didn&#39;t even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Way too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hadn&#39;t broken that stupid mug, everything might&#39;ve been okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t. And it&#39;s not. And there&#39;s no going back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn&#39;t even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam,the door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine marched in. &#34;Sleep is just going to make you feel worse. We&#39;re getting up, and we&#39;re going to find a dick worth loving-one that&#39;s better than Rhys&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WHAT?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, we were off to Skyline City&#39;s most exclusive club-members only.</p>
