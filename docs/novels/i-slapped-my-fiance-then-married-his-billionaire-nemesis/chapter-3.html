                <p>&#34;Is this really necessary?&#34; I stood at the end of the line,shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt. I could practically feel it-if |opened my mouth to speak, my underwear would be on full display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart,we paid a fortune to get into this place.Of course we&#39;re going all in. Do you not get it?&#34;Yvaine declared,like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But isn&#39;t this a little too-&#34; | didn&#39;t even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face likeit had a personal vendetta. I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine let out a dramatic groan. &#34;Mira, come on.We&#39;re going to a bar, not an Arctic expedition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just glad I won&#39;t be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,&#34; I snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d thought we&#39;d have to wait in line like everyone else.That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had zero plans to follow the rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the ease of someone who&#39;d done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer&#39;s hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard chest like a Bond girl who&#39;d forgotten her martini.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten seconds. That&#39;s all it took. We were in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of champagne. I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she&#39;d personally hired the man.Regal,effortless, born for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who&#39;d just woken up from a freezer nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hadn&#39;t known each cocktail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might&#39;ve even convinced myself I was pulling it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus Christ!&#34; I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just insulted my entire bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. &#34;Relax.Tonight&#39;s on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude. Considering I&#39;d nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones,wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We found a table near the bar and hadn&#39;t even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shouldn&#39;t be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior&#39;s newest fragrance campaign. Maybe that&#39;s why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two 75s,French brandy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the bartender. &#34;Make it strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, she didn&#39;t forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between sexy and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say	&#34;Oops,didn&#39;t mean to flirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender reached effortlessly for the gin, giving her a half-smile. &#34;Rough night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More like an engagement-level disaster,&#34; she said,casually pointing her thumb at me. &#34;And it&#39;s wrapping up real soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her. &#34;Thrilled that my personal life is nOW public broadcast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She patted my hand with mock sympathy. &#34;Sweetie,this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned away and melted into the crowd,flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A:Six-foot -two, hair neater than your ex-fiancé&#39;s moral compass,shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream sexy without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or,at the very least, a VIP card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked to a new direction. &#34;Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn&#39;t happened yet, but he&#39;s hot enough you&#39;d forgive him You&#39;d fund his next album and still sleep like a baby.&#34;&#34;Pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, then pointed again. &#34;Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like &#39;books your doctor&#39;s appointment and your breakfast&#39; dad, not &#39;calls the waitress &#39;sweetheart&#39; and thinks climate change is a myth&#39; dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned into my hands. &#34;Yvaine, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t back down. &#34;Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, far too casually, she said, &#34;Hey, want to hit the bathroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes.&#34;No?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...Or maybe let&#39;s move tables? The vibe here&#39;s weird.&#34;Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weird vibe? We&#39;d only been sitting for ten minutes,and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine&#39;s standards, we hadn&#39;t even made it past the opening credits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I followed her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A half-private booth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need more details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That face-I would never forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances. I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply &#34;stepped aside,&#34; choosing to selflessly walk away fromn a future with Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fiancé&#39;s lap, locked in a pose so intimate it looked less like a casual bar date and more like a budget version of Fifty Shades of Grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We&#39;d broken up. It was done. Time to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until I heard what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d fall apart over a coffee mug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she&#39;d just killed someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently swirled the wine in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile. &#34;Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she still doesn&#39;t know you&#39;ve been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint,wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration.&#34;Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot -on. Even I almost believed you were worried she&#39;d find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene. She&#39;s so stupid-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your affair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. &#34;I had to act like | cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn&#39;t compete with you, she&#39;d lose it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his chest. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Knowing Mira, she&#39;s probably still scrambling to fix things. She&#39;s the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a blade. &#34;But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just &#39;happened&#39; to return home. Her parents don&#39;t know a thing. They didn&#39;t even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. &#34;Isn&#39;t this the best &#39;ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. &#34;You&#39;re right. You always are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine must&#39;ve been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything stupid-but l didn&#39;t hear a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped free from Yvaine&#39;s grip and turned to the bartender.&#34;Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger&#39;s tab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul -didn&#39;t even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I&#39;d just ordered mineral water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular,burning purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from hell-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys&#39;s forehead split instantly, a trail of blood beginning to drip down between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. &#34;Mirabelle?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice.&#34;You&#39;re misunderstanding, it&#39;s not what you think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm,his gaze dark and cold. &#34;Don&#39;t bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn&#39;t matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We&#39;re just correcting an old mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s panic twisted into smugness in an instant.She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed,&#34;Oh,honey, your head&#39;s bleeding. We have to get to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side,fury radiating from every pore. She raised her hand,ready to slap Catherine straight back to whatever pit she&#39;d crawled out of. &#34;You disgusting,two-faced bitch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. &#34;Yvaine,let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked eyes with Catherine&#39;s smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. &#34;After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s smile froze on her lips. Rhys&#39;s face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine,emboldened,lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. &#34;Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly escort these two walking health code violations off  the premises.&#34;</p>
