                <p>The night sucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just me and my traitor brain spinning in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the morning, I saw his shoes by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant he&#39;d come back sometime in the dead of night but was now gone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could&#39;t pretend I wasn&#39;t disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But work slammed into me, and I buried myself in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent the next few days camped out at Moss &amp; Flame, working ten-hour shifts, hunched over gem settings and wax casts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came home too wrecked to care about anything, let alone our &#39;rehearsal.:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was apparently busy too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sign of him for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even a shadow in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our whole flirt-to-convince-the-family thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dead in the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which-fine by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sort of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was hot, yeah, but cuddling with someone that good-looking without actual benefits was borderline torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, something worth celebrating: I wrapped up the custom set for Octavia Grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handmade, hand-set, one of a kind,absolute knockout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And too precious to be entrusted to couriers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took them straight to her agent&#39;s office myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia was all smiles and gasps, cooing over the necklace like it was a newborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed both my hands, shaking them like she was trying to absorb my talent through touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so much better than the overpriced crap those luxury brands churn out. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in their design departments. Half the time, it looks like they let a blind pigeon do the sketches. But this? This is art. I&#39;m wearing this to the festival, no question. I&#39;ll be the hottest bitch on the red carpet. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s Cannes or Cleveland-nobody&#39;s topping this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beamed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beamed at the jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But seriously,&#34; she went on, frowning, &#34;why are you wasting your talent at some no-name studio? I&#39;ve never heard of Nyx Collective before. It&#39;s small, isn&#39;t it? With your skills, you should be running your own label.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mostly because she was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of days later, my annual leave was officially up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no choice but to haul my arse back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quitting still wasn&#39;t on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Partly because Savannah had been the only one mad enough to sign a fresh-out-of-uni nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I owed her for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And partly because I wasn&#39;t planning on crawling into another design studio ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was done making magic for someone else&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My next step was my own studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My rules, my name on the door, my signature-and only my signature-on the designs,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only problem was, I didn&#39;t have the clout or the capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nyx Collective was in meltdown mode when I stepped back into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were speed-walking like it was an Olympic event, someone in comms was crying into their smoothie,and even Savannah&#39;s usually composed assistant had mascara smudged halfway to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha spotted me and lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira!&#34; she chirped, waving enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front desk girl was in her early twenties, blue braids today, holographic nails, wore cat ears unironically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d actually come back,&#34; she said, grinning as she leaned over the counter.&#34;We were taking bets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, rude,&#34;I deadpanned. &#34;What were the odds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sixty-forty you&#39;d rage-quit. I had faith, though. You owe me a coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe you nothing.&#34; I gestured to the hive of activity. &#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, total war zone today. Violet&#39;s been tweaking Eliza Black&#39;s designs like a maniac. Eighteen revisions.Eighteen. Can you believe it? | thought Savannah was going to start foaming at the mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked. &#34;Eighteen? Jesus. What&#39;s she doing, engraving runes on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t be shocked. They finally signed off on the final version like-two hours ago? So now everyone&#39;s basically speed-running production like it&#39;s a boss level. Eliza&#39;s flight is at 2 p.m.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already 10 a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were shouting over each other, elbow-deep in foam padding,checking every clasp and stone under brutal lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone barked about airport couriers, another yelled for a lint roller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet Lin was busy stuffing boxes into bigger boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t see me at first, so I just hung back, observing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t close, but I caught a glimpse when she cracked the lid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes locked on the set inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gorgeous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashy,but tasteful-just the sort of thing that made you tilt your head and go...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hang on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about it tugged at me, like I&#39;d seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squinted, but I was too far away to get a good look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably just my imagination,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet suddenly caught me staring, and it was like I&#39;d just triggered a fire alarm in her brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed the box shut, spun around to face me. &#34;What the hell are you looking at? You trying to steal my inspiration for your own designs? Is that it? Planning on copying me,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you seriously think I&#39;d waste my time copying your designs?&#34; I snorted. &#34;What is this, 2005? Get real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34; She glared at me like she was ready to throw hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she shouted at the nearest person, &#34;Get this to the airport, now. Don&#39;t even think about missing Eliza Black&#39;s flight. If you do, you&#39;ll be the one paying for the breach of contract, got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The poor guy was shaking, barely managing to hold the box without dropping it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think he thought Violet was about to explode if he didn&#39;t move fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet spun back to me, now all smug like she&#39;d just won the war. &#34;I&#39;ve got the final pieces done, the flight&#39;s still got hours to go, no need to panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congrats,&#34;I said dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear Vanna called you, told you to come back and help me, but you couIdn&#39;t be bothered, huh? You were just waiting for me to screw up so you could have a good laugh,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow and looked at her like she&#39;d lost her mind. &#34;Babe, do you have any idea how paranoid you sound right now? Have you seén a doctor about this, or should I take you myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. &#34;Then why&#39;d you pick today of all days to come back? You wanted to watch me crash and burn, admit it.&#34;</p>
