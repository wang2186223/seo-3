                <p>I&#39;d been stewing over it all day and stlll hadn&#39;t decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage wasn&#39;t Hke picking a flavor of ice cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You couldn&#39;t just go,&#34;oops, not that one,&#34; and hit undo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p># Ashton were just Ashton, some guy with a decent job and a halfway-decent sense of humor, I might&#39;ve jumped in headfirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Ashton bloody Laurent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As in Laurent Global Holdings, Laurent Towers, Laurent being-on-the-news-for-buying-a-small-country kind of Laurent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was busy spiraling in my flat, Yvaine texted me in all caps: GET YOUR ASS OUT. WE&#39;RE DRINKINVG.NO EXCUSES.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to shout,but whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>could use a distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe a bit of tequila would kill my indecisive streak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ithrew on a loose red jumper and skinny jeans, then headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skyline had dipped to near-zero this week, but the bar was sweaty as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loud music, overpriced drinks, and enough perfume in the air to set off a fire alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine slung her arm around my shoulders and leaned in, shouting over the bass, &#34;Just the two of us is boring. Let&#39;s order a few male hosts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Order some for yourself, babe. I&#39;m good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes. &#34;Wait. You&#39;re in a mood. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a sip-whlskey sour, not bad-and muttered, &#34;There&#39;s something I need to decide. I can&#39;t telf ff doing f would be insane or just... Impulsive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t tell me this is about Rhys again. If he shows up trying to &#39;fálk things out,&#39; I swear fo God, Mira,you must not cave, or I&#39;ll dlsown you on the spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about Rhys,&#34; I said, then paused. &#34;Actually, random question-aren&#39;t you kind of tight with that friend of Ashton&#39;s? Cas or whatever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian Langford?&#34; Her nose wrinkled.mates with my brother Emmett. Always hanging around the ouse like a stray. What about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s friends with Ashton, right? Think you could casually fish around for me? Get some intel on Ashton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>er eyes went wide. &#34;Why the hell are you digging into Ashton? Don&#39;t you already know him, being fake-ngaged to him and all? Why ask someone else about him? What exactly do you want to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dating history, maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come again?&#34; She blinked like I&#39;d glitched. &#34;Why do you care about that? Wait-don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve actually aught feelings? Wasn&#39;t this whole engagement thing just pretend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focus, gossip later. Just find out what you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine, fine.&#34; She sighed. &#34;I think I heard Cas say something the other day. Lemme call him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She disappeared into the loo with her phone and reappeared barely three minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Got the goods. Cassian says Ashton&#39;s been hung up on some girl for years. Problem is, she&#39;s got a poyfriend. He never had a shot, but appårently he&#39;s still not over her. Hasn&#39;t dated anyone else since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stared at my drink, my fingers tightening around the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was the ghost in his closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine went on. &#34;But that was ages ago. Ashton went off to Europe, and Cas doesn&#39;t exactly have eyes on his love life over there. So whatever intel he&#39;s got could be totally outdated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or he&#39;s still not over her,&#34; I said, half to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine gave me a long look. Then-bam-realization hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face morphed into a cocktail of pity, sympathy, and fulf-body cringe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. Oh no. Honey, you&#39;ve actually fallen for him? Are you serious? 「mean, yeah, he&#39;s hot. And richer than every ancestor l&#39;ve got going back to the Bronze Age. But ff he&#39;s stilf hung up on someone else and you go chasing him... isn&#39;t that just you and Rhys all over again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#f Ashton was still pining for some long-lost ex, that just confirmed one thing-he wasn&#39;t expecting anything from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then this marriage was exactly what he said it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, clean, no-strings deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s the case,&#34; I muttered, &#34;marrying him doesn&#39;t sound too bad...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine shrieked. &#34;What marriage? Who the hell are you marrying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even wait for me to answer. &#34;Please tell me it&#39;s not Rotten Rhys. Mira, babe, I swear, if you&#39;re even thinking about going back to that sentient trash fire-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not him,&#34; I cut in. &#34;It&#39;s Ashton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me in mute horror for a full two minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just blinking. Processing,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably trying to remember if I&#39;d hit my head recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then finally: &#34;You drunk? Did you eat something weird? Did Rhys spike your drink with stupid pills? You&#39;re marrying Ashton Laurent? Like, for real real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Thinking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine reached out and felt my forehead like she was checking for a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, are you okay? Do we need to call someone? The Grangers have clearly scrambled your brain.You think you can fust marry a Laurent like ordering a cake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 grabbed her wrist and gently lowered her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me explain,&#34;1 såld, then walked her through the whole quickie mnárrlage proposál situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more I talked, the wider her mouth got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I was done, she looked like someone could&#39;ve shoved a tennis balf in there and she wouldn&#39;t even notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached over and gently shut her jaw for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the deal. He came to me, not the other way round. I&#39;m still thinking it through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine rebooted after about a minute of blank staring, then shot off the bar stool like her arse had caught fire and grabbed both my hands in a death grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to think through? Mira, don&#39;t think, just do! Marry him tomorrow! He&#39;s, like, a million times better than Rotten Rhys. There is literally no man in Skyline more gorgeous and loaded than Ashton fucking Laurent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her back down onto the stool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, calmn the hell down. Marriage is still kind of a big deal, don&#39;t you think? This feels... too fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fast is the new normal,&#34; she fired back. &#34;Half the city&#39;s out here getting hitched after three Tinder swipes.Say yes first, panic later. Worst case, you divorce. Best case, you get to stare at that face every morning over coffee.Win-win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she smirked, her whole expression going full perv. &#34;And let&#39;s be real, you marry him,things are bound to liven up in the bedroom. I mean, you&#39;ve got first-hand experience, haven&#39;t you? He probably fuc-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smacked the back of her head. &#34;Jesus, get your brain out of the gutter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine dropped the act, her voice growing serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, all jokes aside, Ashton&#39;s solid, at least from what l&#39;ve known about him so far. Plus, can you imagine Rhys&#39;s face when he finds out you married a Laurent? He&#39;ll have a fucking meltdown. I&#39;ll throw a party just to rub it in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we&#39;d dissected every angle, drawn diagrams, and ránked Ashton&#39;s abs on a ten-point scale (he scored twelve), I&#39;d elready made up my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After work the next day, I was lying on my sofa like a corpse, clutching my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d written and rewritten the damn message so many times, my thumbs were sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time I hovered over Send, I chickened out and hit backspace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the clock hit eight, I&#39;d typed a whole novella and deleted all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the lights cut out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dead. Black. Silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just lay there blinking like, seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My old apartment went dark every time someone sneezed too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now this one was on the same bullshit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot upright and jabbed the property management number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tried again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third time-voicemail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brilliant,&#34; I muttered, already half-pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasri&#39;t Oakwood Apartments supposed to be under Laurent Global Holdings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton Laurent owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even had a flat here, so unless he liked showering in the dark, he should&#39;ve sorted this crap out ages ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved on some fluffy slippers and padded out into the hallway.</p>
