                <p>She was sitting like she&#39;d been poured into the seat,legs crossed, posture casual, her face so absurdly perfect it made me want to toss my entire skincare routine in the bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the Octavia-film awards, designer perfume campaigns, the kind of actress who could cry in a close-up and make the whole cinema sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d watched her latest film three times and still hadn&#39;t forgiven her for dying beautifully in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In person, she looked even more impossibly flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like someone had photoshopped her into real life without asking the rest of us for permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked in behind Ashton, mny legs moving on autopilot, and slid into the seat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all very polite and awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea what the hell was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time I&#39;d been anywhere near LGH, Dominic had let slip that Octavia was pursuing Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which apparently included dates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Romantic ones.⑪</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So now my options were:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A) Ashton had gone completely insane and decided to introduce me to his almost-girlfriend like we were in some weird throuple drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B) He was dumping me. In a restaurant. In front of Octavia Grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be a bold move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or was this some twisted arrangement where I got to meet the real woman in his life-while I played the decorative spouse for legal convenience?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shoulders tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every trashy soap twist I&#39;d ever half-watched started queuing up in my head like a playlist from hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ashton rested his hand briefly on mine. &#34;This is my wife,Mirabelle Vance. And this is Octavia Grey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia held out her hand. &#34;Lovely to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it, still half waiting for someone to shout&#34;C∪t.&#34;&#34;Hi. I&#39;ve seen your work. You&#39;re even more gorgeous offscreen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was easy. Friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single trace of competition or possession in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile took the edge off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not completely, but enough that I didn&#39;t feel like l needed to throw my drink in someone&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked exactly like she did in the films-only now l could see the tiny mole near her left ear and the way her lashes curled at the tips without mascara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what threw me was her vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The press always painted her as some frosty diva who&#39;d send back bottled water for being too wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the woman in front of me was warm, open, and totally lacking the catty energy I&#39;d braced for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by the cozy familiarity but zero chemistry between her and Ashton, I&#39;d definitely overthought the whole he&#39;s-about-to-dump-me-for-an-actress situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the food arrived, Ashton cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle, she&#39;s got a favor to ask,&#34; he said, nodding toward Octavia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; I jabbed my thumb at my chest. &#34;You sure you&#39;ve got the right Mira?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton gave Octavia a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, smiling like we were besties at brunch.&#34;Ash mnentioned you&#39;re a jewelry designer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m flying out to the Venice International Film Festival in a few days, and I still haven&#39;t locked in my jewelry. The big brands all sent stuff, but it&#39;s the same old shiny crap. I wanted something different.Something custom.&#34; She paused. &#34;So... Miss Vance,I was wondering if you&#39;d be interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton coughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia&#39;s eyes flicked to him, then she caught herself and corrected with a laugh, &#34;Sorry-Mrs.Laurent, would you be interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Ashton a sideways glance, like she was checking if she&#39;d passed the test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a tiny nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at her, completely floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me? Designing for Octavia Grey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could snap her fingers and have Cartier groveling at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here she was, asking me to do her red carpet jewelry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t going to just any film fest-she was going to that one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Venice gig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same one where Eliza Black, our current Nyx Collective obsession, was making her big splash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d practically turned the office into a shrine for that project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Octavia was a different league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of star who was the headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything she wore would be dissected, reposted,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sold out, memed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time&#39;s tight,&#34; she went on. &#34;Every designer I&#39;ve worked with said no. Too risky, too rushed. But if you&#39;re up for it...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I blurted, a bit too loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia&#39;s smile widened. &#34;Fabulous. It&#39;s a mad timeline though, so I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be pulling some very ugly hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine! I&#39;ve got a half-finished design set that might work-l can push to wrap it up, source the materials in parallel, and start production straight away. We&#39;ll make it in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded like she was impressed. &#34;Perfect. But I&#39;ll need to see the designs first. If I don&#39;t love them, l&#39;d rather hit the carpet in bare ears and a naked neckline. I&#39;m not wearing anything meh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. I&#39;ll send you the sketches tonight as soon as l get home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spent a few more minutes discussing details, and by the time we exchanged contact info,I was pretty sure I was floating two inches off my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt weirdly like meeting a childhood pop idol-only this one drank sparkling water and might wear my jewelry on a red carpet streamed to millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Ashton ducked out to take a call,leaving me alone in the room with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia glanced over, sipping her drink. &#34;You kept looking at me. Then at Ashton. Then at me again.Everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I choked on air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised a brow, clearly enjoying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, fine, I had been looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to figure out if she was secretly eye-banging Ashton under the table.</p>
