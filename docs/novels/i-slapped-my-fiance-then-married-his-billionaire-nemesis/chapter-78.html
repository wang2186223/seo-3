                <p>Verdict: she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a sheepish smile, cheeks burning like I&#39;d swallowed a radiator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I&#39;d been subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia laughed, a silvery sound. &#34;You thought Ash and I were a thing, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned. &#34;Yeah... I might&#39;ve read that whole situation completely wrong. Sorry, that was just me being dumb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grinned. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not the first woman to assume that. But trust me-he&#39;s all yours. Ash and I are related.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are?&#34; | tried to recall if I&#39;d noticed any resemblance in their features, but came up empty;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>after all, didn&#39;t all beautiful people sort of look alike?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a distant cousin on his mum&#39;s side. We weren&#39;t close growing up, only started reconnecting a few years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Dominic Everett had been chatting shit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe I&#39;d messed up the name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there another actress he&#39;d been gossiping about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before | could untangle that mess, Octavia continued, &#34;It&#39;s obvious he really likes you. I&#39;m happy for him, honestly. Took him long enough to find someone he actually wants to marry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me this look-warm and kind and a little nostalgic. &#34;Ashton was... difficult as a kid. Bit of a loner. For the longest time, I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d ever settle down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t elaborate, and I didn&#39;t press.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t seem right to dig into Ashton&#39;s childhood when we were out here lying to half of Skyline City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for her comment about him liking me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no bloody idea where she was getting that from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I pasted on my best bashful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia studied me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she leaned in across the table, eyes gleaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here. I&#39;ve got a secret for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in without thinking,totally hooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cupped one hand around her mouth and whispered into my ear, &#34;I&#39;m actually married. Two kids. So you don&#39;t have to worry about me and your husband getting too cosy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped so fast it nearly cracked the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared at her, blinking like a malfunctioning android.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia Grey-the goddess of the screen, everyone&#39;s favourite unattainable icon-wasn&#39;t just taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kids. Plural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never gone around shouting about being single, but no one had ever mentioned a husband,let alone tiny humans she&#39;d birthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman had been on every screen and billboard since I was fifteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the hell did she have time to grow humans?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised one finger to her lips like we were co-conspirators. &#34;You&#39;ve got to keep this between us,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... of course.&#34; I nodded like a dazed puppy, then blurted out, &#34;Can I get your autograph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smooth.Real smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Yvaine would&#39;ve killed me if I didn&#39;t ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia laughed. &#34;How many do you want? I&#39;ll sign &#39;em all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner wrapped, and I climbed into Ashton&#39;s car for the ride back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still halfway between impressed and scandalised about Octavia&#39;s mum-life reveal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entertainment industry was crawling with secrets, apparently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On screen, she was the ice-queen CEO type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm.Funny.Chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eliza Black, TV&#39;s favourite cupcake in heels, was about as cuddly as a parking warden in rush hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere between red lights, I remembered what Octavia had said earlier-that Ashton liked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peeked sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sitting to my right, silent, face unreadable as usual, eyes shadowed in the low lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It almost looked as if he was napping, except his posture was anything but relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dismissed Octavia&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton wasn&#39;t in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least not with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a precious ex stashed somewhere in his chest like a vintage wine no one else was allowed to touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still... even if he didn&#39;t like me, not really, he&#39;d been good to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That part I couldn&#39;t deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been careful. Attentive. Almost gentle, in his own terrifying way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneaked another peek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze stalled on that jawline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked intense even when he wasn&#39;t supposed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man tackled everything with the same laser-focused,maddeningly sincere attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he&#39;d climbed to the top of the billionaire food chain at an age when most people were still figuring out how not to drown in student loans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take our fake marriage, for instance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t just planned it; he&#39;d rehearsed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scheduled sessions. Run-throughs. Bullet points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, I&#39;d thought it was overkill, a kind of neurotic control-freak move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But apparently it worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia, an actress trained to lie for a living,hadn&#39;t suspected a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of rehearsals...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still one scene we hadn&#39;t nailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stole another glance at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the polite two inches of distance between us, I could feel the heat radiating off his thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in my lower belly fluttered-hot, reckless,and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached over and pressed a button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The privacy screen between us and the driver slid up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton glanced at me, eyebrows drawing together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twisted my upper body so I was facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for bringing me to meet Octavia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I leaned in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One quick kiss. Just a soft press of lips to his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, I was turning back to face front like it hadn&#39;t just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was dark. Quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could feel his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I dared look again, his eyes had gone low and dangerous, lit up with something wild and hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not the kind of kiss I want,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what kind of-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t finish the sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton lunged at me.</p>
