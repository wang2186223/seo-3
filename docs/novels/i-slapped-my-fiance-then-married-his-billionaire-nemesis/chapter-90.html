                <p>I tilted my head, smirking at her. &#34;So, how&#39;s life abroad been treating you? Since you&#39;re back in town, I&#39;m guessing your family decided to un-disown you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel&#39;s grin wavered, freezing for a heartbeat before she caught herself. &#34;Fine. Not that it&#39;s any of your business. FYI, my family treats me like the queen I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really? Like a queen? That&#39;s why they shipped you off with a single suitcase and no return ticket?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stomped her heel, but the tip bounced off the concrete by the pool, making her wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she stepped closer, invading my space. &#34;What are you even doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could ask you the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a friend of the Laurents. Engaged to one, actually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? I&#39;m married to one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone with at least one functioning ear must have heard about me and Ashton by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel was just being her usual petty, self-important self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped in again, and I jabbed a finger toward her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get any closer. That knockoff Chanel stench is triggering my gag reflex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared but stayed where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think you had it in you to snag Ashton Laurent.&#34; The sneer might have been fake, but the jealousy in her voice couldn&#39;t be hidden. &#34;Damn, girl. Gotta hand it to you. Heard Rhys Granger dumped you, but now I&#39;m thinking it was the other way around. Bet you ditched him for an upgrade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No point dignifying that with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 always knew you aimed high,&#34; she went on. &#34;You never dated in high school. Everyone thought you were just a stuck-up nerd. But I knew better. You weren&#39;t wasting that pretty face and perky rack on boys who still lived off theirmum&#39;s credit cards. And look where it&#39;s got you-married to the golden goose. Must&#39;ve taken a hell of a lot of effort to get Ashton into bed, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My patience cracked. &#34;What the hell do you want, Isobel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing major,&#34; she said, her tone turning ice-cold. &#34;I just want you to keep your mouth sut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what? About how you ruled the school with your little mean-girl dictatorship? How you got your arse handed to you for weeks after the winter dance and dropped out like a coward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shot wide. &#34;So you&#39;re admitting it! You were the one who jumped me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;I admit nothing. Just recapping what everyone at school knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It had to be you!&#34; she hissed. &#34;Only you had-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? A motive? Don&#39;t flatter yourself. You made enemies like it was a full-time job. If I lined up everyone who wanted a swing at you, l&#39;d need to rent out a whole city block just to manage the queue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>IsobeI floundered, mouth half open, eyes blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never admit it, but the years abroad must have changed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had knocked the edges off, sanded down the queen-bitch arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spoke again, her voice was noticeably softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, I didn&#39;t come here to reminisce,&#34; she said, trying for a more reasonable tone. &#34;Quentin and I are getting engaged soon. I&#39;m hoping the past can stay in the past, and I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t mention..anything to him about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just might,&#34; I said, purely out of spite, though I&#39;d never laid eyes on Quentin before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rose in her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel gripped her handbag. &#34;Don&#39;t. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s in it for me?&#34; I asked, just for the hell of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened. &#34;Are you blackmailing me? You want money?&#34; She was part incredulous, part scornful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re married to the richest man in the city-hell, maybe in the country. Why would you need my money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want your money. I want you to go to the police and admit it was you who hired that thug,you who spiked my drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then no deal.&#34; I turned to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; She scrambled forward a step. &#34;Come on, for old time&#39;s sake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked back over my shoulder. &#34;We don&#39;t have old times. And if we did, I should probably kick your arse for them. But lucky for you, I&#39;ve mellowed with age.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on!&#34; she whined. &#34;I&#39;m not asking you to do anything. I&#39;m literally asking you to NOT do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t respond, she dropped the sugar-coated act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t say anything if you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow. &#34;What have you even got to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like how you used to moon over Rhys like some tragic little fangirl. I saw you doodling his name in your sketchpad. Don&#39;t even bother denying it.&#34; She crossed her arms, her cleavage pushed up and on full display.&#34;You wouldn&#39;t want your current husband to know you were obsessed with another man,would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted. &#34;Please. Everyone within a hundred-mile radius knew about me and Rhys. Ashton included. If that&#39;s your big ace, you&#39;re welcome to tell him. See what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smugness slipped from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could tell I wasn&#39;t bluffing, and panic flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I said casually, twisting the blade just a little, &#34;1wasn&#39;t even going to say anything. But the more you beg, the more tempting it becomes. And if you really are marrying Quentin... well, that would make us in-laws of some miserable sort. Imagine having to see you at Christmas dinners. Ugh, no thanks. I&#39;d better go warn Quentin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t.&#34; Her voice dropped an octave, threatening now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t l?&#34; | stepped towards her. &#34;I don&#39;t know what kind of man Quentin is, but I doubt any Laurent would wantto marry a schoolyard bully. A mean girl turned social climber. People don&#39;t change, Isobel.Leopards don&#39;t sprout stripes. What if you have kids and raise a bunch of little bullies just like Mummy? I&#39;d be doing Quentin a favour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle Vance!&#34; she snapped. &#34;Don&#39;t think that just because you&#39;ve got Ashton Laurent wrapped around your little finger, I can&#39;t hurt you anymore.&#34;</p>
