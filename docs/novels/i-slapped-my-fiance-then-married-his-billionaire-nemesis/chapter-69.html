                <p>An hour later, Dominic delivered a red Ferrari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it out for a spin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wind in my hair, sunglasses on, death grip on the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even remember the last time I&#39;d driven, and I barely hit twenty miles an hour, gliding down the street likea pensioner on sleeping pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey rode shotgun, grinning like a proud driving instructor, tossing out compliments as if I was doing laps at Silverstone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after a few blocks, muscle memory kicked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loosened my grip, leaned back, and let the engine purr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I pulled back into the drive, there was an actual smile on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, just as I was about to retreat upstairs after dinner, Ashton said, &#34;My grandfather&#39;s birthday&#39;s coming up. We&#39;ll need to attend together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I remember.&#34; | stopped halfway up the stairs and flashed him an OK sign. &#34;I&#39;ll be the perfect fake wife.Promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Laurents aren&#39;t idiots,&#34; he said. &#34;Well, some of them, anyway. If we slip up, even slightly, they&#39;ll catch on. And if anyone starts thinking I&#39;m not serious about this... that I&#39;m using the marriage to manipulate Grandfather-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say no more. What do you need me to do?&#34;I dropped onto the sofa across from him, still riding the high from the Ferrari and feeling uncharacteristically agreeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed one leg over the other, long limbs folded like he was posing for a Vogue editorial without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this man ever got bored of being a powerful CEO,he&#39;d make a killing on magazine covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could rehearse,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real calm. Real nonchalant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my mind, &#34;rehearse&#34; meant something chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rundown of the backstory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fake engagement 101.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe even a few lines to memorize so I didn&#39;t accidentally say we met on Bumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I got was... choreography.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood side by side at the front door like a couple of understudies about to botch their big debut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton said, &#34;We&#39;ll rehearse how we walk in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him. &#34;You&#39;re kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, we were doing blocking like it was West End week at the Laurent Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I half expected a stage manager to pop out with cue cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was kind of fun, but also... kind of awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least the house was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey and the staff had cleared out, so there was no one lurking to watch me embarrass myself in socks and a faded hoodie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I relaxed. Slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I glanced down at my slippers, then back at him. &#34;We&#39;re going in dressed like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The costumes will come in later,&#34; he answered, as if he hadn&#39;t realized I was joking. &#34;If you walk in that stiff, they&#39;ll see right through it. Get closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted half a step toward him, already feeling oddly self-conscious. Then his hand landed on my waist from behind and pulled me inlike I was a prop that needed repositioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed against him, chest to chest, all breath and heartbeat and...fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up, ready to make a joke about personal space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our faces were so close I could smell his cologne and feel his breath on my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away.Fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, it tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I muttered, eyes glued to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid his arm more snugly around my waist and started guiding us forward, leading like we were about to waltz into high society instead of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made it from the door to the sofa and back again.Twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped. &#34;No. This won&#39;t cut it. We&#39;re way too stiff.Anyone with eyes will know we&#39;re faking it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I licked my lips. &#34;So what do we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t just walk like strangers and hope no one notices. If we want them to buy this, we need chemistry. Real intimacy. And we need to cultivate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how exactly do we &#39;cultivate&#39; that?&#34; | asked,air-quoting with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We start simple. With a hug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean, technically he was my husband now, but mentally I was still stuck in that awkward co-tenant headspace where our deepest bond was shared Wi-Fi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hug?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My soul wasn&#39;t ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, even Rhys and I had rarely hugged-and that was a man I&#39;d seriously been in love with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took one forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So did he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It went on like some ridiculous mating dance until my back hit the bloody kitchen island and I had nowhere else to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head slightly, bringing his face level with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was a low purr against my ear. &#34;Would you be willing to give it a try, as a favor to me? Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hairs on my neck stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So did other things I wasn&#39;t going to acknowledge in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I turned bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was this man leaking sex appeal like it was his second job?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw. &#34;Yeah. Fine. Let&#39;s do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting. That&#39;s all it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d watched enough TV growing up to fake a convincing hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could channel every romcom heroine who ever had to pretend she didn&#39;t want to jump the male lead&#39;s bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton opened his arms, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, muttered something unrepeatable under it, then stepped into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yeah, alright, he felt... expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cotton Henley was soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body was not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my arms around his waist and instantly hit a wall of solid muscle under all that casual fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bloody hell. The man was built like a secret weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands settled on my back, one at my waist, one brushing my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a light tap, almost a pat. &#34;Relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easy for him to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t the one trying not to pass out from pheromone overdose.</p>
