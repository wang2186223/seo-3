                <p>The building sat like a smug, glass monolith right in the middle of downtown, prime real estate with a reflective metal fa?ade that flashed sunlight in every direction, as if it were trying to blind the poor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slxty-eight floors of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It towered over everything, like ft knew it owned the skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LGH didn&#39;t just deal in real estate and finance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had their fingers in every pie-tech, hospitality, tourism, you name it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it generated income, they were knee-deep in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was also a hotspot for influencers and wannabe TikTok stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d passed it plenty of times and seen people doing twirls or filming dance routines right outside the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never actually gone in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, it was all clean lines, matte finishes, and subtle displays of wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like, &#34;Yes, this chair costs more than your car, but we won&#39;t mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You couldn&#39;t get past the lobby without clearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which meant I was promptly intercepted by the front desk, where a girl with perfect eyeliner looked me up and down like I&#39;d shown up to a Met Gala in Crocs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t go upstairs without an appointment,&#34; she said, smiling the way dentists do before drilling into a nerve. &#34;Mr. Laurent gets swamped with requests every day. His calendar&#39;s booked out months in advance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me another once-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell exactly what she was thinking-here&#39;s another one, trying to land a billionaire with a fresh blowout and a hopeful bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joke&#39;s on her. I hadn? even bothered with mascara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe come back in thee months,&#34;she suggested, this time with á sprinklé of pity</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found a seat in the lobby&#39;s vlsitor zone and texted him: I&#39;m at LGH. Can I leave the jacket at reception?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes ticked by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then five more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the reply came, I was seconds away from hurling the jacket at the nearest bin and calling it a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton:Contact Dominic Everett, my assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent a phone number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No &#34;thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the message, already annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this hassle for one stupid jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, I had to take time off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I got treated like a groupie or wannabe gold-digger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I had to track down his assistant like Iwas hand-delivering the Ark of the Covenant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, I was such a mug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this effort for a guy who texted like a contract clause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I&#39;d already come this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Might as well see it through and avoid the karmic curse of unfinished favors.</p>

                <p>Dominic glanced around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a kid sitting on a Christmas secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly dying to spill, but also shackled by his corporate leash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the leash snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Octavia Grey,&#34; he whispered, like it was classified intel. &#34;She&#39;s been after our boss for ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia Grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hottest A-lister on the planet right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just won the biggest film award in the country for some critically acclaimed indie drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You couldn&#39;t open your phone without her face popping up-red carpets, interviews, aesthetic brunch pics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had that lethal combo of fame, talent, and bone structure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I&#39;d seen her in clips-she was the definition of icy-hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always looked like she&#39;d sooner roll her eyes than flirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now she was chasing Ashton Laurent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was trying to process the mental image of those two breathing the same air, Dominic dropped another bomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Vance, I&#39;m sure you know, um, our boss is in a rush to get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that even Ashton&#39;s assistant openly discussed his desperation to tie the knot made my brain glitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said,&#34;Yeah,I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had said he wanted me to think about his little marriage proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the looks of things, I wasn&#39;t the only one with a spot on the shortlist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I said no, maybe he&#39;d be signing marriage papers with Octavia Grey by tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wasn&#39;t kidding about being in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a business deal for him, obviously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably thought any warm body would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was it the same for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I said no to him, would I also have options?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically,yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was Rhys, with Louisa&#39;s blessing, and Leonard Something my mother tried to set me up with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, I blocked Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt amazing for about seven hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then this morning, he called me from two different numbers, like a desperate Tinder ghost who couldn&#39;t take a hint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my mother had been blowing up my phone too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even need to pick up to know what she&#39;d say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at it now, marriage with Ashton might actually be the smartest move I could make, and possibly the only move, short of moving away and changing my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please excuse my being so direct, but l&#39;ve worked with Mr. Laurent for years and, trust me, he&#39;s not into those celebrity types. You&#39;re the one he&#39;s most satisfied with, Miss Vance. You should really consider your position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; I nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll think about it.&#34;</p>
