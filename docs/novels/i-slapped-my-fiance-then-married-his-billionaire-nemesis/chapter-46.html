                <p>Cassian frowned. &#34;Hold on. I visited you a couple of times in Eindhoven. You never said you knew Mirabelle.I never even heard you mention her name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know it was her,&#34; Ashton said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he remembered from that night was the woman-warm skin, steady arms-who must&#39;ve noticed something was wrong with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d taken him to the hospital. Paid the bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I woke up,&#34; Ashton said, &#34;she was already gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian blinked. &#34;So how the hell did you know it was her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had my assistant look into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he saw the photo-Mirabelle Vance,design student at Eindhoven University-he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl from Florence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one with the quiet fire in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian leaned in, eyes gleaming. &#34;And then? You tracked her down and asked her out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got the first part right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did track her down. He had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he never approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were too many eyes on him. Too many knives out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want her anywhere near the blast zone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then business exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His life became airports, mergers, new markets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he could think about her again, she was back in Skyline City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And engaged to Rhys bloody Granger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t forget her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian drained his drink and slapped his own forehead.&#34;Wait! So all those calls you made to me, protending you cared about gossip-Skyline&#39;s charity galas,who wore what, who was dating who-that was all about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton gave him a look.&#34;Since when do you know me to give a shit about gossip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian barked a laugh. &#34;Ha. So you weren&#39;t just nosing around Skyline&#39;s corporate scene.You were low -key stalking Mirabelle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t stalking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; Cassian drawled. &#34;You landed back in Skyline less than twenty-four hours after I mentioned the rumours. Not suspicious at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Cassian told him what he&#39;d heard-that things between Mirabelle and Rhys Granger were spiraling, that Granger had his eye on someone else,that he&#39;d only proposed because his family twisted his arm-Ashton felt something crack open inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something dark and stupid and completely impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t living the glossy, charmed life he&#39;d imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t planned on coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d built a whole empire from scratch. all of it his own,none of it tainted by his family&#39;s maddling hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second he heard Rhys Granger might be out of the picture, he was on the mext flight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that followed was scripted. Comtrolled.Calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle-sharp, lovely, frustratingly trusting-ended up married to him in less time than it took most people to choose a phone plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few conversations, a little emotional pressure,and the perfect storm of heartbreak and rebound... boom.Married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he knew she wasn&#39;t over Granger. Not really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t married him because she loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d married him because she was cornered, and he&#39;d offered her a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But love could be built. Brick by brick. Kiss by kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d take the cracks Rhys left behind and fill them with gold if that&#39;s what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care how long it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian was two bottles deep and halfway through his third by the time it finally sank in-this wasn&#39;t a prank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton Laurent, their resident forever-bachelor,had actually gone and got himself hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not fake-married. Not some stunt. Married-married</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smug bastard didn&#39;t stop at flashing the ring either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d pulled out the marriage certificate like it was a business card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stamped,signed,government-issued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looked legit enough, at least to Cassian&#39;s booze-blurred eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congrats, I guess,&#34; Cassian muttered. &#34;If it makes you happy.You finally bagged the girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton clinked glasses with him. &#34;I amhappy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian slapped a palm to his forehead. &#34;Bloody hell,I knew something was off. You moved too fast! I didn&#39;t even get to throw you a stag do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I don&#39;t care about that sort of thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate. It&#39;s not for you. It&#39;s for us-your mates-to gather and mourn your freedom. A symbolic send-off before you&#39;re locked in the eternal tomb of marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton just shrugged. &#34;I&#39;ll live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but what about the wedding?&#34; Cassian waved a hand at the paper. &#34;Sure, that cert looks all official,but you&#39;re not about to flash it every time someone asks if you&#39;re single. You need a reception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s smile dipped. &#34;There&#39;s no wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian squinted. &#34;What, like... is that a new thing now?No ceremony? Not even a quiet one at City Hall with the fam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t want a wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian snorted. &#34;Every girl wants a wedding. That&#39;s literally what the industry was invented for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton remembered those bridal magazines stacked on Mirabelle&#39;s kitchen counter in her old apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bookmarked dress pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notes on flower combos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d tossed everything out when she moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian gave him a nudge, half-drunk. &#34;You sure about the whole no wedding thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there would be one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he played his cards right-and didn&#39;t piss her off too much in the meantime-there&#39;d be vows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;d be flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;d be Mirabelle in white, walking toward him for real this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian burped. Loudly. &#34;No wedding, no gift, yeah?That&#39;s how this works. No open bar, no obligation.I don&#39;t get to chat up the bridesmaids, you don&#39;t get a toaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. You&#39;re off the hook for the gift.&#34; Ashton leaned forward. &#34;But I need you to do something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian perked up like a retriever. &#34;Anything, bro.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a gossip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian looked wounded. &#34;Excuse you. I&#39;m a high-end information distributor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. I need you to do your thing. Start leaking the news. Casual-like. When you&#39;re chatting to people,just drop it in-&#39;Oh, didn&#39;t you hear? Ashton and Mirabelle got married. Someone saw them at the clerk&#39;s office.&#39; That sort of thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian blinked. &#34;You want me to start a rumour? But I thought you wanted to keep it low profile. Hence no wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t his call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Mirabelle&#39;s request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No big splash, no media circus, no kiss-the-bride headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had respected that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he needed her to start seeing this marriage not as a temporary contract, not as an expediency,but as real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Permanent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A done fucking deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked Cassian deadin the eye. &#34;Just do it.&#34;</p>
