                <p>My head jerked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized Ashton. My ridiculously attractive neighbor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think... someone I know might&#39;ve been in an accident.&#34; I swallowed my rising panic. &#34;I need to get to the Granggers&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second I had enough brain cells online to function,I fumbled for my phone and ordered an Uber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, wobbly, and made it two steps before Ashton caught my arm. &#34;Let me drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,I can-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll take ages to get a ride from here,&#34; he said,already pulling me toward the lift as if I&#39;d agreed.&#34;My car&#39;s downstairs. It&#39;s faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wrong. Also, I wasn&#39;t in the mood to argue Not when my nerves were having a full-blown seizure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the lift descended, Ashton made a quick call-something low and calm in that velvet voice of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the lobby, a sleek black car was already waiting at the curb. A guy who looked like his assistant handed over the keys, then melted into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Passenger side,&#34; Ashton said, nodding at the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night air slapped some sense back into me.I climbed in without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton slid into the driver&#39;s seat, took the wheel, and floored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only once we were barreling through traffic did it occur to me that I had zero clue where we were even going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dug out my phone. &#34;I need to call someone, figure out which hospital-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton tapped his Bluetooth earpiece and answered a call with a smooth,&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could get through to Louisa, Rhys,or even Clive bloody Granger, he ended the call and said,&#34;Louisa Granger&#39;s at Eldergrove Private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared. &#34;How the hell-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes on the road. &#34;I had my assistant check emergency admissions in the area. You said car accident, mentioned the Granger name. It wasn&#39;t exactly a needle in a haystack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too impressed to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton went on, &#34;Louisa Granger was admitted ten minutes ago. She was conscious when they brought her in, but she&#39;s being treated now. Multiple injuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my hands together in my lap. My whole body tensed, spine peeling away from the seat like I couldn&#39;t sit still even if you superglued me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been rushed in for emergency care. That meant serious. That meant... it could be bad. Life-or-death bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton glanced at me, then tapped something on the touchscreen embedded in the dashboard. Soft,calming music began to play-something instrumental and mellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll be okay,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music helped. So did the subtle scent wafting through the car, something clean and woody that l was ninety-nine percent sure was coming from Ashton himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drove in silence for a bit. Then he asked, &#34;She means a lot to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;She&#39;s probably the best parental figure I&#39;ve got,&#34; I said, then let out a dry little laugh. &#34;Honestly she&#39;s been more of a mum to me than my actual mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying it out loud felt strangely comforting. Like1could finally exhale without choking on the panic.Something in me started to unclench, just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help thinking about when I was little and Mum used to make me wear Catherine&#39;s hand-me-downs. Picture seven-year-old me drowning in a sparkly unicorn jumper two sizes too big, looking like I&#39;d been mugged by a clearance rack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Louisa hated that. She&#39;d whisk me off to hers for dinner, clock my tragic outfit, and the next thing l knew, we were in a department store and she was  holding up dresses like we were auditioning for The Great Kiddie Style Intervention. Then she&#39;d march straight over to my mum&#39;s and start a row that could probably be heard in the next district.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I got engaged to Rhys, every time I got sick-which, to be fair, was no more than once a year-Aunt Louisa was the one sitting beside my hospital bed,feeding me soup and telling the nurses off like she owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without her saying it out loud, I was starting to realize she didn&#39;t just see me as a future daughter-in -law. She&#39;d already decided I was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my head and wiped my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had I been selfish breaking things off? Maybe I should&#39;ve just played along-married Rhys, become Mrs. Rich-and-Repressed, and lived the rest of my life with perfectly curled hair and zero opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s driving was fast and smooth. We pulled up outside the hospital in record time. The second the tires touched the curb, I shoved the door open and jumped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold slapped me right in the face. I hunched my shoulders but didn&#39;t slow down. At the emergency desk, I asked for Louisa Granger. The nurse gave me the once-over-messy hair, red eyes, possibly a relative-and said, &#34;Eighth floor. Trauma unit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got there, I saw Rhys pacing like he was about to challenge the vending machine to a fistfight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Louisa?&#34; | asked, bracing myself for the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still in surgery. She only went in a few minutes ago,&#34;he muttered, running a hand through his perfectly gelled hair like that would magically calm him down.&#34;The doctor said she&#39;s got a fractured arm, a busted knee, and some internal bleeding they need to sort.Nothing life-threatening, but they&#39;ve got to operate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shoulders dropped half a centimeter, just enough to feel that it wasn&#39;t catastrophic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the guilt swanned in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa had been on the phone with me when the car hit her. I wasn&#39;t the one behind the wheel, obviously,but | couldn&#39;t exactly claim full innocence either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys clearly shared the same thought, because he turned and glared at me balefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was upset when she found out you weren&#39;t coming to dinner,&#34; he snapped. &#34;She insisted on calling you. Went outside to do it. If she hadn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she hadn&#39;t called me, she wouldn&#39;t have been hit, is that where we&#39;re going?&#34; | crossed my arms, already feeling the heat rise behind my ears.,guess what? If you&#39;d had the balls to tell her l&#39;wasn&#39;t showing up and cancel the dinner, she wouldn&#39;t have needed to call me in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched. His fists did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I thought we were about to put the &#39;emergency&#39; in &#39;emergency room&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience-fresh and unwanted-had taught me that Rhys wasn&#39;t always a pacifist when things didn&#39;t go his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back, on guard.</p>
