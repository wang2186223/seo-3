                <p>Ashton was already moving before the maid had finished speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the stairs four at a time and reached the second floor in a matter of seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not stopping to catch his breath, he shoved open the bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle was buried under a pile of thick duvets, her face flushed scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin had been bloodless just half an hour ago, ghost-pale and ice-cold after she&#39;d nearly drowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she looked like she was overheating from the inside out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were screwed tightly shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She started heating up a while ago,&#34; the maid behind him stammered.&#34;1got a thermometer and... it&#39;s forty degrees and climbing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton strode over and pressed the back of his hand to her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t just burning up; her skin was scalding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just picked her up-duvet and all-cradled her to his chest, and turned on his heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hospital.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the room buzzed with shocked whispers, but Ashton barely registered them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swept through the hallway, his footsteps thudding over the marble floor, and vanished through the front doors without sparing a glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver had already pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton slid, into the back seat with Mirabelle in his arms, and the car peeled off a moment later, tires screeching faintly against the cobblestones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the mansion, the stunned silence didn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He left? Just like that?&#34; someone whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the old Mr. Laurent&#39;s birthday, for God&#39;s sake. Ashton&#39;s the head of the family. What happens to the party now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The old man&#39;s still here. The show must go on,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the middle of the chaos, Isobel was still kneeling on the floor like some half-forgotten prop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew what to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one wanted to be the first to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the sound of a cane hitting the floor snapped through the chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edouard Laurent appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression thunderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thumped the cane once more for effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. All this noise. What are you, chickens in a bloody coup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, even retired, even half out of the family business, the old man&#39;s presence sucked the air out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scowled, muttering under his breath. &#34;Finally get the family together, and that ungrateful brat walks out in the middle of it. The boy clearly doesn&#39;t give a damn what this old man thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Declan shrugged his shoulders. &#34;Not his fault, Pop. Blame Quentin&#39;s psycho girlfriend. She started it. Big bro&#39;s not gonna sit through dinner while his girl&#39;s dying of a fever or whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edouard&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Ashton wasn&#39;t the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But ditching a family event for a woman chafed at his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze landed on the wreck still kneeling on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think this is a bloody street market?&#34; he barked. &#34;Dragging strays into the ancestral home like it&#39;s a bloody dog shelter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin&#39;s mother paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she might throw up or faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Uncle Edouard. I... We&#39;ll get her out of here immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged forward and snatched Isobel&#39;s arm. &#34;Get up! You&#39;re humiliating all of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was a raw, streaked mess of mascara and blood, smeared from where she&#39;d slapped herself until her skin cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her designer heels had snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dress clung, damp and crumpled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t react to the shouting or the shoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edouard slammed his cane again, loud enough to make the crystal chandelier rattle.&#34;All of you-out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin and his parents froze for half a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin grabbed Isobel by the elbow, dragging her limpform out the double doors like luggage with a broken handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the back of the Rolls, Mirabelle was wrapped so tightly in a duvet she looked half-mummified, but her body still shuddered like she&#39;d been left outside in a blizzard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Faster,&#34; Ashton barked at the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle&#39;s hand was a limp, burning thing in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hated how light it felt. Hated the tremble in her jaw, the way her teeth tapped faintly behind her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest felt like someone had cinched a steel cable around it and started cranking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed the back of his fingers against her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin pulsed with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You afraid of water?&#34; he asked, quiet now, the way he only ever spoke when it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t fully out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were closed, lashes clumped from the pool water, but her lips moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scared...yeah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pulled her closer until her forehead nudged the hollow beneath his collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mumbled, slow like her brain was lagging a few seconds behind, the fever turning her words sticky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drowned... once. In high school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted against him, instinctively curling into his body, cooler than hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheek pressed against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the duvet, he felt her soft curves, the fine tremble of her ribs with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smelled like chlorine and hot chocolate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He touched her face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still boiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palm hovered for a second before settling on her cheekbone, gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was Isobel Brooke there? Back in high school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle&#39;s brow furrowed like someone had tugged at a dream she didn&#39;t want to look at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah...yeah,she was...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s expression iced over. &#34;She pushed you in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; Mirabelle blinked slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pupils barely tracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to remember, her face scrunched up with the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stroked her arm. &#34;It&#39;s okay. Never mind that now. Don&#39;t talk. Don&#39;t think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where...we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned. &#34;Don&#39;t like...hospitals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to ask why not, but Mirabelle had already drifted somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In broken fragments-half-formed, jumbled, slurred-she started mumbling into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to tilt his head down, almost press his ear to her lips just to catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bits and pieces slipped out: Isobel. The drink. The creep waiting for her at some derelict building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the worst part-almost drowning in that river, her lungs full of water, no one to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton listened, his face carved from stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted it now, regretted not breaking his own rule about not laying a hand on a woman, not even one like Isobel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should&#39;ve done it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should&#39;ve put her on the ground back at that party when he hadthe chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts spiraled, darker by the second, veering into places he usually kept chained up and buried deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the sharp wail of anambulance siren cut through, snapping him back.</p>
