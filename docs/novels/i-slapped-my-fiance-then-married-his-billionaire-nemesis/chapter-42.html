                <p>I walked over, gently took her arm, and helped her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Louisa, I came today because... It&#39;s about the engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face didn&#39;t change much, but I watched it like a hawk anyway, ready to call an ambulance if her blood pressure spiked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa sighed. &#34;Just say what you need to say. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t overreact this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid the box across the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the brooch you gave me back then. Now that Rhys and I are no longer engaged, it doesn&#39;t feel right for me to keep it. I&#39;d also like the gold ring my parents gave your family returned. Let&#39;s just make a clean break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa ran her fingers over the brooch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her, Willow sat likeshe&#39;d been sculpted from pure snobbery-chin up, shoulders back, eyes full of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still didn&#39;t buy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought I was playing some long con.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe forcing a breakup to win Rhys back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa grabbed my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you absolutely sure about this? Rhys isn&#39;t perfect,I know. But once you break off the engagement,what happens next? You&#39;ll be alone. Everyone in Skyline knows you&#39;re his fiancée. They think you&#39;ve been chasing after him for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was true; I had been chasing after him for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you walk away now, they&#39;ll laugh behind your back.You&#39;ve got no one to back you up. Have you thought about what that really means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum!&#34; Willow snapped. &#34;She&#39;s not calling off the engagement, she&#39;s pretending to call it off-obviously!It&#39;s just another sob story stunt to get a reaction out of you. God knows what game she&#39;s playing this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it,&#34; Louisa shot her a look sharp enough to peel paint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored Willow. &#34;Aunt Louisa, you don&#39;t have to worry about me. I actually came today with some good news too-l got married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instant silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Granger women froze, mouths slightly open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Willow found her voice and used it to shatter glass. &#34;What the hell are you talking about???&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got married. For real.&#34; | turned to Louisa. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;ll be just fine without Rhys. Better,even.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow&#39;s face scrunched like she&#39;d just bitten into a lemon. &#34;You&#39;re not seriously faking a marriage just to break up Rhys and Catherine, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Rhys and I are ancient history. Whatever he does with Catherine is none of my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached into my bag and pulled out the marriage certificate, handing it across the coffee table. &#34;We signed the papers today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa reached for it, but Willow snatched it away first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is fake,&#34; she barked, flipping it over like she was searching for a watermark. &#34;You&#39;re full of tricks. No way is this real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged.&#34;There&#39;s no reason to fake it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept squinting at it. &#34;Wait a second... is this-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes bugged out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally looked at the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton Laurent?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She screamed it like it burned her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she laughed-full witch-cackle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle Vance! If you&#39;re going to fake a marriage,at least use someone believable. Where the hell did you get the nerve to Photoshop Ashton Laurent&#39;s name onto a marriage cert? It looks legit, I&#39;ll give you that. You must&#39;ve paid a fortune for the forgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa didn&#39;t believe it either. &#34;Mirabelle, where did you get this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow snorted. &#34;Gotta admit, it&#39;s a pretty good fake.Who&#39;d you hire, one of those dodgy hacker forums?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look she gave me belonged on a mugshot wall,smeared with smugness and judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her and turned back to Louisa. &#34;Aunt Louisa,come on. Like I&#39;d forge a government document just to get a rise out of you. Especially one with the Laurent name on it. That&#39;s not just illegal; it&#39;s suicide.You know it. You know me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked her dead in the eye, not even a twitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa&#39;s lip wobbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the truth of my words hit her, so did the tears.&#34;You&#39;re really married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow flaited like someone had just hit her with a water balloon. &#34;Mum, are you serious? Don&#39;t fall for her crap! If Ashton Laurent married Mirabelle Vance,I&#39;ll chop my legs off and moonwalk backwards down Eifth Avenue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw her frantically scrolling through her phone,comparing some internet image to the certificate in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can prove this certificate&#39;s fake,&#34; I said,folding my arms, &#34;I&#39;ll be the one doing the backwards moonwalk. With no clothes on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face changed by degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First doubt, then panic, then full-blown shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slumped into the sofa. &#34;This can&#39;t be real. Mum.Tell me I&#39;m hallucinating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa sniffled and grabbed my hand again. &#34;You can&#39;t just marry some random stranger to spite Rhys. This is your whole life we&#39;re talking about...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton&#39;s not just some stranger,&#34; I said sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t meant to snap, but something about that sentence rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe because it wasn&#39;t entirely untrue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton&#39;s young and good-looking and well-known.Definitely not a stranger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa dabbed her face with a tissue. &#34;I know,sweetheart. He&#39;s obviously miles better than Rhys. 1just... I&#39;m scared you acted on impulse. Men like Ashton, they live on another planet. Can someone like that really treat you right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He does treat me right,&#34; I said, dead calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which was a big statement, considering l&#39;d barely spent more than some dozen hours with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t lying.</p>
