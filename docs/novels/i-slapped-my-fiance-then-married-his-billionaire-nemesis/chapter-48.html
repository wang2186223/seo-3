                <p>The Granger family living room looked like a war zone -overturned vases, a half-shattered wine glass bleeding red across the rug, and a smashed photo frame face-down on the floor, glass splinters glittering like shrapnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive Granger&#39;s slap cracked through the air.should&#39;ve had a vasectomy.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys winced, hand on his cheek. &#39;Il just thought-&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You thought?&#39; Another slap. &#39;You thought wrong,dumbass. You said Mirabelle was obsessed with you.That she&#39;d still marry you even if you were screwing your way through Skyline. And now what? She&#39;s walked. You couldn&#39;t even keep a woman. Jesus, Rhys,I can&#39;t walk anywhere without someone stopping me fo ask about you and Catherine Vane. Everyone knows.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Um, we never actually told anyone about-&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Bullshit!&#39; Clive&#39;s palm met skin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s head snapped sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t fight back. Wouldn&#39;t dare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when his dad looked one blood vessel away from a cardiac arrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You think people are blind?&#39; Clive yelled. You  embarrassed this family at the Laurents&#39; party. Hell,even their dog probably knows what you&#39;ve been up to. And now you&#39;re standing there pretending like you&#39;ve been all discreet and under the radar? Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys just stood there,head bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive turned on Louisa next. &#39;And you just handed over the ring? Are you out of your mind? That thing was the only leverage we had. She gives it back,wedding&#39;s officially dead.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa crossed her arms. &#39;She brought the marriage certificate. What do you expect me to do-eat the paper and pretend it never existed?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive slammed the table so hard the crystal tray jumped. &#39;Mirabelle Vance is a brat. Getting secretly married? She clearly thinks our family&#39;s a joke. Did her parents forget to teach her basic respect?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa sat down. &#39;Don&#39;t drag Mira into this. You know damn well who the problem is. If your golden boy wasn&#39;t out playing sugar daddy to every influencer with a fake tan, maybe Mirabelle wouldn&#39;t have snapped. You want someone to blame? Look in the mirror. He&#39;s your clone, Clive-arrogant,spoiled,and dumb enough to light a match in a gas leak.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive&#39;s mouth opened, then shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa&#39;s eyes were drilling holes into her husband.&#39;Rhys clearly inherited your talent for screwing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive looked away. &#39;What kind of nonsense is that supposed to be?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You kept a side piece for years,&#39; Louisa said with a bitter little laugh. &#39;And surprise, surprise, your son turned out just like you.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You-&#39; Clive&#39;s voice cracked like old wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow jumped in. &#39;Mum, stop. Dad cut things off with that woman ages ago.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa&#39;s eyes glossed over with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jerked her arm free from Willow&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow tried again, desperate now. &#39;The problem isn&#39;t some ancient fling. It&#39;s that Mirabelle married someone else. That&#39;s why Dad&#39;s losing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;And she bloody well should have!&#39; Louisa hissed.&#39;She&#39;s too good for your brother anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys gave Willow a look, one of those silent &#39;get her out of here before someone has an aneurysm&#39;expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow caught it and looped an arm around Louisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mum, come upstairs. Doc said you shouldn&#39;t get worked up again so soon after getting out of the hospital. Why don&#39;t you come and see something I&#39;ve got? I went to that new spa today,and they gave me a face mask that&#39;s basically Botox in a jar. You&#39;ve got to try it.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hustled Louisa out, talking about serums and collagen like their family wasn&#39;t currently imploding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they&#39;d disappeared upstairs, Clive turned to  Rhys. &#39;My study. Now.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mirabelle&#39;s married,&#39; Clive said as soon as the study door was shut. &#39;The wedding&#39;s off. Invitations are already out. How do you plan on cleaning up this circus?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys stared at the mahogany desk like it had answers.&#39;I&#39;ll just. tell everyone it&#39;s cancelled?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive looked ready to strangle him with a Hermès tie.&#39;The whole of Skyline City thinks you cheated on her.Do you have any idea what this does to the Granger name?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys shrugged. &#39;We&#39;ll survive. We&#39;ve survived worse.&#39;In his head, he still believed his mum had a point-if his dad could parade a mistress around back in the day and still close deals like nothing happened,why was everyone acting like his thing with Catherine was some moral apocalypse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least Catherine was his actual soulmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle had been forced on him by his parents, a fiancée he&#39;d never even wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Mirabelle was out and Catherine was back,everything felt right again. Balanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the universe had finally course-corrected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys genuinely didn&#39;t get what all the fuss was about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive let out a loud,weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh filled with disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys didn&#39;t miss it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, it fuelled the slow-burn fury he&#39;d been stewing in all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all Mirabelle&#39;s fault, really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even given him a warning before she&#39;d gone and married herself off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like,what the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to follow him around like a puppy in heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wide eyes, soft voice, always so eager to please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when he messedup-especially when he messed up-she forgave him with this ridiculous belief that he&#39;d eventually grow up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now she was someone else&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed on the edge of the armchair like they were itching to hit something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. She wanted to play dirty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So could he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dad finally spoke. &#39;Thanks to your personal soap opera, people are saying the Grangers don&#39;t honour deals. That we break promises. Three contracts dead in the water this month.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at his only son. &#39;Now do you see what the big deal is?&#39;</p>
