                <p>&#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood in front of me, his voice disturbingly calm-as if he were announcing the fridge had broken, not that I had thrown him onto a bed the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain instantly began sorting through possibilities.Talk about what? A debrief? A review? Was he proposing some kind of... &#34;long-term sexual partnership&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely not a proposal. That sort of thing only happens in soap operas written by people with hopelessly romantic minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he worried I&#39;d cling to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all-it was me who started this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the one who dragged him out of the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the one who opened the hotel door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the one who pinned him down without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; I said, adopting the most mature, responsible tone I could muster, &#34;last night was a mistake. A reckless,impulsive,but...undeniablyenjoyablemistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried not to look at his shoulders. Nor at his chest.Not at the water droplets sliding down his collarbone,tracing over sculpted muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to ask you to take responsibility.I won&#39;t call you crying about emotional trauma. I&#39;m not that kind of girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no reaction, I turned to the door-aiming for a graceful exit, complete with a closure monologue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as my hand reached the doorknob, a warm,wet palm landed on the back of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. Slowly,I turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was looking at me with an expression I couldn&#39;t place-somewhere between surprise and...seriousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t remember me?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, caught off guard. I answered quickly, almost defensively:&#34;Of course I do. You&#39;re my new neighbor.Helped me find my keys the other night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically true. Totally accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I didn&#39;t say-and never would-was that even without those trivial interactions, I remembered him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That face was unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or, more precisely, that face standing in front of me in just a white towel, with water dripping down those abS...yeah. Not something easily erased from memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trick was: don&#39;t look directly at him. Like an eclipse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad that strategy had completely failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still, even though I was fully dressed and he was practically naked, somehow, under his gaze, I felt like the one who was completely exposed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to speak-to say something, anything to shift the focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t press further. He just stood there,watching me, as if waiting for the moment my real reaction would finally come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he said, &#34;It&#39;s fine. Doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked.What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I go now?&#34; | asked dryly. His hand still hadn&#39;t moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me again, then-unhurriedly-said:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not serious.&#34; I finally found my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m completely serious,&#34; he replied, as if he were announcing a quarterly financial report. &#34;I just returned to the country. My parents want me to get married as soon as possible. In their eyes, a married man means stability. And only a stable man can inherit the family  business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days ago, I vowed I&#39;d bring home someone better than Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone impressive enough to silence my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the universe had sent an answer-just with a thick layer of irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage shouldn&#39;t be like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d already lived through a loveless engagement once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All it left was a house full of silence, hollow intimacy,and a slow, brutalerosion of my self-respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at that moment, my phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp ringtone cut through the quiet like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the screen-and felt like a bomb had exploded in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline Vance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have called to announce something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at that face-familiar yet distant-then back down at my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, I said the words:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>can&#39;t accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out of the hotel suite, the ringtone still shrieking behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered, not because I wanted to, but because l needed-desperately-to sever the tie that kept dragging me back into the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you pick up your phone? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s voice came rapid-fire, like machine-gun fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| thought you were dead in a ditch or kidnapped by some maniac! Get home. Now. We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already on my way,&#34; I said coldly, hanging up before she could start round two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave the driver my parents&#39; address and collapsed into the backseat, like someone bracing for a colonoscopy without anesthesia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Let&#39;s get this over with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My neighbor-aka my one-night stand-was probably insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But while I still had a drop of alcohol-induced courage left in my blood-while the old Mira, desperate for love,hadn&#39;t crept back in-I had to move fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to throw this ruined mess back in their perfect little faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Vance family estate sat in the kind of suburban enclave that didn&#39;t welcome anyone who couldn&#39;t afford a BMW. No subway stops. No bus routes. Just an elegantly worded &#34;keep out,poor people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the wrought-iron gate, I took a deep breath. I felt like a boxer entering the ring. Shoulders squared. Chin up. Emotional armor locked in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I entered the living room,I could sense the ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father-Franklin Vance-sat alone in his leather chair, wearing the same expression he probably used to fire underperforming hedge fund managers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him,my mother,Caroline,with her perfect hair and perfectly aligned pearl necklace, smiled the way a doctor does when saying, &#34;The cancer&#39;s spread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To their left, Rhys sat on the sofa, all solemn and brooding, as if waiting for a divorce lawyer to direct his next pose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And on the right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine,obviously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All we were missing was a gavel and a court reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a trial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the defendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the verdict had already been written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother struck first,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What took you so long? I called you hours ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms, her tone colder than the AC.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Traffic,&#34; |lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I told them I&#39;d just escaped from a man in a towel,they&#39;d have me hospitalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So? Why am I here?&#34; My tone was sharp, iced over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until Rhys stood, a bandage still across his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of him looking vaguely wounded brought me a small,grim satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You left this at my place,&#34; he said slowly, holding something in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your bear alarm clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cheap, scuffed electronic clock shaped like a cartoon bear,its plastic face scratched and faded from over a decade of use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, this relic was their opening move?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage rose in my throat, but I swallowed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I said flatly. &#34;That&#39;s... thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snatched up the ridiculous little clock and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come on. No one calls a full-blown family meeting just to return an alarm clock. I knew better. This was about humiliation. About putting me in my place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were the real family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was always the outsider-invited in only when they needed a benchwarmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; my mother said, her voice even colder than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused. Didn&#39;t turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her arms again and smiled-a tight,poisonous smile you only see when a doctor says &#34;Stage four.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that Catherine&#39;s back,&#34; she said, &#34;and since you and Rhys have broken up, we believe it&#39;s time-he and Catherine should be engaged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a short, humorless laugh. Turned around slowly,letting the sarcasm drip from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By all means. Plan whatever you want. It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve ever asked for my opinion before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We used to ask,&#34; she shot back, her voice sharp,&#34;back when you were still the sensible daughter. The one with potential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too emotional, Mira. Your insecurity made you paranoid-accusing Rhys, trying to control him. You didn&#39;t trust him, and that&#39;s what destroyed the relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light in tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruthless in effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is on you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And you&#39;ll make that clear in the press.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tell them you fell for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why you ended the engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ripped open inside my chest-like they&#39;d torn it apart with their bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them-all of them-my parents, Rhys,Catherine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So calm. So deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a script they&#39;d rehearsed for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had I done to deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had I gone so wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to explode. To storm out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that&#39;s when my father finally stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a judge preparing to read the sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about finding someone new,&#34;he said with absolute finality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve already made arrangements-&#34;</p>
