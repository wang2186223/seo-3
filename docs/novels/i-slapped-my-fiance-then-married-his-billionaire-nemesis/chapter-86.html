                <p>He crossed his legs-tight, as if that was the only thing stopping him from yanking me closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel his control slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers clenched the sofa cushion like he needed an anchor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, he was fighting hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see it all over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,suddenly,he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in a wild,throw-me-down way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he slammed his palm into his other hand, as if he was physically trying to shake himself out of whatever trance I&#39;d pulled him into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed up to stand, but my arms stayed locked around his neck, not ready to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swore under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he kissed me again, fast, hard, breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that,&#34; he muttered against my lips.&#34;Orl&#39;ll...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words barely registered in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already drunk on the taste of him, high on the heat, melting into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he lifted me, carried me towards the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One moment, I was in his lap, and the next, I was on my back, flat against the sheets in my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft, but sharp enough to slice through the haze l was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there, boneless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like someone had unplugged every wire in my body and replaced it with static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin still tingled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse was still racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I couldn&#39;t tell which was stronger-relief or disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of me was weirdly glad he&#39;d stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t, I might&#39;ve just stripped him naked and begged him to ruin me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the other part-the one powered by hormones and sheer, shameless lust-was screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who the hell walks away when a woman&#39;s practically throwing herself at him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I not sexy enough? Hot enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he just that noble?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was stopping him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was clearly all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by my flushed cheeks and throbbing everything, my body hadn&#39;t exactly been subtle about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he&#39;d walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he hung up on someone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saving himself for some sainted ex he still lit a candle for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like Rhys had done with Catherine while pretending to date me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were the odds I&#39;d fall for the only two men in all of Skyline City who knew how to keep it zipped when temptation was literally on their lap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up, pulled my shirt forward, glanced down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way. Still hot,&#34; I told my boobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why the hell was Ashton acting like a monk in a meat market?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day was the big one-Edouard Laurent&#39;s 80th birthday bash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no intention of showing up looking like I was trying too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I grabbed a simple white dress, understated, clean, no bells or whistles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my long, dark hair fall freely, nothing too fussy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single piece of jewelry, not even a stud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I came downstairs, Ashton was in the living room, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked on me the entire way down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a casual glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the kind of look that peeled back layers, that imagined every detail beneath the dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire in his gaze, the way his jaw flexed-it wasn&#39;t subotle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t picturing a polite family dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was picturing something far more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw it in the twitch of his fingers, the rigid set of his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat that shot through me was instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of me wanted to gloat-see what you walked away from last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost did a little twirl just to twist the knife... but the stairs were steep, and I wasn&#39;t about to somersault into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another part of me itched to demand answers-if you&#39;re so good at mentally undressing me, why didn&#39;t you just follow through? What the hell&#39;s stopping you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this wasn&#39;t the moment for that kind of question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the bottom, I looked up at him with a teasing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes stayed on me, devouring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after what felt like five years, he said, low and hoarse, &#34;Beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for his hand, and he took it without hesitation, pulling me towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the car, he held on a second longer, then finally let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The parking lot at the Laurent estate was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old cars, new cars-all gleaming, all expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was a milestone that clearly warranted pulling out every last stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped out of the car, I took in the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family,friends, distant cousins dragged out of hiding-everyone who could make it was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s family tree was less tree, more tangle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edouard Laurent had a few brothers and sisters, and each one had their own army of children and grandchildren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s father, Reginald, was Edouard&#39;s youngest son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald had three sons, Ashton being the eldest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throw in a bunch of distant relatives, and you had a party that could rival any school reunion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s arm slipped around my waist, and we walked towards the house in sync.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any nerves I&#39;d had were long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clocked the man at the door-probably a butler-do a double take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, like his brain needed a moment to compute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the staff couldn&#39;t help sneaking glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had timed our entrance perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was already crowded-clusters of people laughing, catching up, or locked in that awkward family small talk you only ever heard at holidays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second we stepped through the door, silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like someone had hit mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the ones pretending not to notice got elbowed by whoever stood next to them.</p>
