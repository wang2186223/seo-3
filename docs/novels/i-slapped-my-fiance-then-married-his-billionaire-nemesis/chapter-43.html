                <p>I remembered that night at the Laurent party, how he dropped everything the moment I needed to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He canceled the whole party and personally drove me to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that coat. He&#39;d wrapped it around me like I was something worth saving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys would&#39;ve let me pass out on the marble floor and asked someone to mop around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So yeah.Ashton Laurent was a lot of things. But &#34;just some guy&#34; wasn&#39;t one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He treats me well,&#34; I said again, louder this time.&#34;Aunt Louisa, I&#39;ve found something better. You don&#39;t need to worry about me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kouisa&#39;s eyes filled up again. &#34;I don&#39;t even know what to say. Rhys was never meant for you, I see that now.He&#39;s the one who lost out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced pointedly at the box on the table.&#34;Au Louisa...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a resigned sigh. &#34;I get it. Whatever bond you and Rhys had, it&#39;s over. That old keepsake means nothing now. I&#39;ll go get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her climb the stairs, slow and hunched like  the weight of family disappointment was dragging her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my head, I whispered a quiet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Granger family had already sent out half the wedding invitations with my name stamped next to Rhys&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now they&#39;d have to claw them all back, one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Clive Granger would probably explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa would be the first in the blast radius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still chewing on that thought when Willow suddenly let out a snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t peg you for a social climber, Mira. But look at you-bagging Ashton Laurent. Who knew you had it in you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dripped with spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably because Ashton wasn&#39;t just rich and hot; he was the billionaire fantasy every bored socialite dreamed of landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday,some C-list actress had &#34;accidentally&#34;leaked paparazzi shots of her bumping into him outside a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone like Willow had probably entertained the idea of &#34;accidentally&#34; falling into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now he was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,sort of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That day at the hospital,&#34; she snapped, eyes  narrowing, &#34;I knew something was off when he showed up with you. Did you seduce him? Got some sleazy photos and blackmailed your way into a ring?Or maybe drugged him-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My palm connected with her face so fast even I didn&#39;t see it coming. &#34;Watch your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just slapped me?&#34; Willow shrieked, springing off the sofa like she&#39;d been electrocuted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to hit back, but I grabbed her wrist mid-swing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nails dug in just enough to make her wince and twist like a squashed bug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last time I didn&#39;t hit you back was out of respect for Aunt Louisa. Don&#39;t mistake that for weakness. That slap just now was for the filth coming out of your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved her back onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even know Ashton until after I dumped your brother. So maybe back off before you embarrass yourself even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please,&#34; she spat. &#34;You expect me to believe you two just happened to fall in love right after the breakup? Spare me. I see right through women like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked over and picked up the marriage certificate from the table, slipping it back into my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your darling brother cheated on me with my sister,and you&#39;ve got the nerve to come at me? Cute. Either you&#39;ve got double standards or you genuinely think it&#39;s fine for guys to two-time their girlfriends. In that case, I hope your next boyfriend&#39;s just like your scumbag brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34; Willow turned the color of an overripe tomato.Then she huffed, &#34;Whatever. I&#39;m not wasting my time arguing with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you get to call it quits now?&#34; I shot back.&#34;Didn&#39;t you just say you&#39;d moonwalk backwards if l actually married Ashton? Now that you know the cert&#39;s real... I&#39;m still waiting, babe. Moonwalk or coward-pick one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow went silent, pretending she hadn&#39;t heard a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she cleared her throat, mumbled something about being late for a Pilates class and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Louisa came downstairs, holding a ring box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed it to me like it hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if things didn&#39;t work out between you and Rhys,I still think of you as my daughter. Don&#39;t be a stranger,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.&#34;I know, Aunt Louisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the only decent Granger in the entire godforsaken gene pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged her, promised to keep in touch, then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second I stepped out of that house, it felt like someone had finally cracked open a window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was waiting for me outside. &#34;All sorted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All sorted.&#34; I slid into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clocked the ring box immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked down, then back to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave it a playful shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The engagement gift,&#34; I said. &#34;And now I&#39;m officially Rhys-free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton leaned in suddenly, close enough that I could feel his breath against my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart started pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, trying not to blink like a stunned deer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34; | asked, my voice not nearly as casual as I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just smiled and pulled something from behind his back, like a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except this wasn&#39;t a rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a velvet jewelry box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He popped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside was a pendant necklace that made Tiffany&#39;s look like Claire&#39;s Accessories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t showy-no diamonds vomiting from every corner-but the design was clean, elegant, and rich in that quiet,terrifying way.</p>
