                <p>I stepped into her space. &#34;Oh really? What, you&#39;re going to threaten me now? Come on, Isobel. It&#39;s 2025, not the Wild West. What&#39;s the plan-whack me? You think your precious family&#39;s still going to clean up your mess? Still going to bail you out after everything you&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed deep red, her breath jagged like she was seconds from bursting a blood vessel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk to me like that!&#34; she hissed, her raised voice drawing attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around, suddenly self-conscious, and lowered her tone. &#34;Fine. How much wouldit take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, I don&#39;t want money. I want you to go to the police and confess. Own up to what you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not gonna happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like I could conjure up a sack, throw it over her head, and pick up where we left off back in high school with a proper beatdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Short of that, I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled after me.&#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clamped onto my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stronger grip than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I backhanded her in the ribs, hard enough to make her wheeze and let go with a winded &#34;oof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow! You hurt me!&#34; she snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll hurt you worse if you keep following me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of kids ran past, squealing, inflatable swim rings bouncing around their waists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped aside to avoid them, my back momentarily to Isobel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must&#39;ve thought that was her moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without looking, I felt it-the air shift, the sharp clack of her heels against the concrete, the sickly waft of her perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sidestepped and pivoted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged straight past me-arms flailing, legs sliding-and crashed towards the swimming pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except I&#39;d mnisjudged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t shift far enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she flew past, her flailing hand caught the back of my knee and yanked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pitched forward helplessly, headed straight for the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water hit me like a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold, sharp, punishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It slapped against my skin and swallowed me whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank immediately, the chill biting into my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All sound blurred into muffled silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thrash-Isobel&#39;s arm, maybe trying to swim-caught me across the stomach, knocking the breath from my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her leg clipped me again, and I was pushed further away, the current scattering us like broken pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should&#39;ve been fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pool wasn&#39;t deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kids swam here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the world tilted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision dimmed at the edges, narrowing like a tunnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged-sudden,irrational, all-consuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of fear that didn&#39;t care about logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My limbs turned to stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My arms flailed weakly, but they weren&#39;t swimming-they were sinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold wasn &#39;t just water anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory hit me like a brick to the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago. High school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sixteen and stupid, still trusting people I shouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel had lured me to an abandoned building with some thug from off-campus-someone twice my size,reeking of cigarettes and something worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d wanted to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my head was spinning from the spiked drink someone had handed me earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bastard reached for me, slurring something, and I knew if I didn&#39;t get out, something irreversible would happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;d been a rusted piece of rebar on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found it by accident, fingers grazing cold metal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he lunged,I swung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It landed with a sickening thud, and he went down hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The back window was loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a river below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even hesitate. I jumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t swim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not then. Not while I was drunk, disoriented, terrified out of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water closed over me, cold and endless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked, thrashed, screamed-but it all stayed trapped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that existed was the current, swallowing me, choking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taste of dirty water in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of my clothes dragging me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization that no one was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was utterly alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that old terror-the one I&#39;d buried so deep-slammed into me now like it had never left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pool wasn&#39;t a pool anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was that river again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wasn&#39;t Mirabelle Vance, the woman who survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was that sixteen-year-old girl again-betrayed,alone, drowning with no one to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My limbs forgot how to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body forgot how to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clamped down like a vise, locking every muscle, scrambling every thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know which way was up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lungs convulsed, desperate for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened, and water rushed in, cold and vicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The edges of my mind flickered, like a dying lightbulb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure, slicing through the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t tell if it was real or just my brain giving me something beautiful to die to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hallucination. A ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was coming straight for me. Fast, purposeful, unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened again, but this time not for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe for help. Maybe for a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-arms. Solid. Real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wrapped tight around my waist, anchoring me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when I knew it wasn&#39;t a dream, wasn&#39;t a trick ofthe light or some fading fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the moment that truth registered,my body gave out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything went black.</p>
