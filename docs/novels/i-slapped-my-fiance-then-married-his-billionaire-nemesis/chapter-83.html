                <p>One month later, I found Isobel walking to her car alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited by the trunk, yanked a sack over her head, dragged her behind the bleachers, and beat the smugness out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I did it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every week, likeclockwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she showed up to school with a bruise or a limp, I made sure I had an airtight alibi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel cracked fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t handle it without her little entourage fluttering around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By week five of being jumped out of nowhere, she quit showing up altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents pulled her out and shipped her off to a boarding school overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her gone, the bullies backed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guess they figured I might put a bag over their heads next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t come out unscathed either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sixteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d barely kissed a boy, let alone fought off some drunk creep inan abandoned building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So yeah,maybe that night carved something jagged into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe that&#39;s why I took up boxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand waved in front of my face. &#34;Hello? Youheard what I said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped my mind back to the present. &#34;Yeah, I heard. You talk loud enough to be heard five blocks away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you do remember Isobel, right?&#34; Serenna&#39;s smile sharpened. &#34;You&#39;re not still traumatized, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up,forcing her to tilt her chin up to keep eye contact. &#34;If she&#39;s stupid enough to show her face, I&#39;ll make sure to continue where we left off. And you?&#34; I stared down at her. &#34;Might want to watch your step,sweetheart. I hit a lot harder than I used to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just returned to Moss &amp; Flame after lunch when my phone lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle, please. You&#39;ve got to come back.&#34; Savannah sounded like she was two seconds from crying or committing a crime. &#34;Eliza Black&#39;s torn the sketches apart ten times now and still hates them. The film festival&#39;s right around the corner. If Nyx Collective doesn&#39;t deliver, we&#39;ll have to pay breach penalties-serious ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize Violet won&#39;t let me help unless I agree to be her assistant, right?&#34; | said. &#34;And there&#39;s no version of reality where that&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the boss,&#34; Savannah huffed. &#34;What she wants doesn&#39;t matter.I&#39;ll double your pay. Just come back and sort this out. For me, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flicked to the last text from my bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let&#39;s just say I wasn&#39;t scraping for Uber fare anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Double pay used to sound like salvation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now? Not so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m gonna pass,&#34;I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned into a high-pitched whine. &#34;You&#39;ve been gone for days. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually thinking of quitting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Not yet, anyway. &#34;I&#39;ve still got some annual leave to use. And don&#39;t forget, I&#39;m a freelancer. I come and go as I please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She groaned. &#34;God, you&#39;re such a pain. I should&#39;ve seen this coming. But I had to try, didn&#39;t I? Fine. Go enjoy your precious holiday. But we&#39;re clear, right? Holiday. Not resignation. If you resign, I swear I&#39;ll block it like my life depends on it. Don&#39;t make me get on my knees, Mira. I&#39;m too old for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Fine.Holiday it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d circle back to the qutting bit later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way, Vanna, can I take on my own projects while I&#39;m off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her tone sharpened with suspicion. &#34;Side projects? What kind? With who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept it vague. &#34;Nothing specific yet. Just... something I&#39;m considering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, right, of course,&#34; she said, her voice edging into panic. &#34;You can, obviously. I mean, you&#39;re still Nyx Collective, yeah? So anything you do goes out under our name. That was in the contract, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, because we&#39;ll promote the hell out of it. Your name front and center-superstar designer, all that.Mira,really, working with you has been a dream. You basically built Nyx. Honestly, I thought Eliza Black would go for your concept. No idea what kind of brain-dead manager she&#39;s got whispering in her ear. But hey, client&#39;s king,right? Just...cut me some slack, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a shrug she couldn&#39;t see and said, &#34;Yeah. I&#39;ll keep the Nyx name on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah let out a breath. A bit too loud. Then,tentatively:&#34;Okay, but... what kind of projects are we talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed on. &#34;I mean, seriously-what could you land out there that tops designing custom pieces for a damn A-lister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed quiet. Let her speculate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you come back,&#34; she said quickly, &#34;and Eliza Black&#39;s wearing Nyx at the Venice Film Festival-that&#39;s massive. That&#39;s the kind of exposure most designers never get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still nothing from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Violet Lin would both get credit,&#34; she added, a little too fast. &#34;Come on, Mira, this is Venice. The Venice International Film Festival. That kind of spotlight doesn&#39;t just fall into your lap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my temple, but she kept at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got taste. Talent. Hell, range. But you&#39;re stilyoung, babe. Your name needs more traction. Don&#39;t waste the momentum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d said that a few months ago, I might&#39;ve caved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then,I would&#39;ve sold a kidney for that kind of press.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now.I had bigger things on my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair, letting the silence stretch before I said,&#34;Let it go, Vanna. I&#39;ve got a lot going on right now. But once I&#39;m done, we&#39;lI talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear her grinding her teeth through the phone, but she didn&#39;t push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smart woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got home just before nine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolfed down dinner,then hit the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrubbed twice, flossed twice, brushed twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sprayed breath spray for a full minute, then popped a mint for good measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost flopped down on the sofa-but stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting there in full makeup as if I was waiting for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t that desperate to continue our rehearsal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except...I kind of was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, all we&#39;d done was some light arm-draping and a couple of those over-the-clothes hugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>G-rated at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after that dinner with Octavia, things had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were we adding a kiss now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my compact and flipped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gave the mirror a breath test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minty. No garlic ghost from dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lipstick: matte,smudge-proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except Ashton never came home.</p>
