                <p>I could feel every single set of eyes on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was... well, Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a walking piece of art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not just beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dangerous-beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like one of those hyperreaistic 3D paintings of a cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stare too long and you start to feel the drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me? I wasn&#39;t bad either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe a little less angelic than him, but definitely more than presentable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could tell it wasn&#39;t the looks that had frozen the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the way I was linking arms with him-easy, intimate, completely unselfconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to our multiple rehearsals (which, fine, had paid off), we didn&#39;t look like just a party fling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We looked like the real thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could practically see the thought bubbles forming above every head:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Mirabelle Vance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t she engaged to Rhys Granger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t she cause a scene at the last Laurent event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she not blacklisted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the main headline was clear:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is she doing with Ashton Laurent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers started immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the center of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton gave the crowd a slow once-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of look that said: What are you staring at? Mind your own business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if he&#39;d flipped a switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air snapped back to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after a second of stunned silence, the conversations resumed, but the topics had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone went back to pretending they weren&#39;t dying to know what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes still flicked our way, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, from the edge of the room, a man stumbled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mid-to-late forties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handsome, if you squinted and ignored the wine bloat and under-eye bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was all confusion and shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth opened like it had forgotten how to form words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-you said you were bringing your wife. This is her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked like someone had just unplugged his brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone here knew I&#39;d been engaged to Rhys Granger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Grangers had only just clawed back their wedding invite, and now-bam-I was here, allegedly married to Ashton Laurent, like it was no big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized the man, but to be sure, I turned and whispered, &#34;Your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton nodded. &#34;Reginald Laurent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald&#39;s hand went to his chest like he was physically restraining a heart attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was turning an alarming shade of crimson. &#34;Ashton, how could you-how could you marry-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beamed at him and stuck out my hand. &#34;Mr. Laurent, it&#39;s so lovely to meet you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his eyes stopped blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he about to faint?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent,&#34; I said again, layering on my sweetest fake-innocent smile. &#34;I brought gifts for everyone. I&#39;ll have the driver bring them in shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turned an even deeper shade of maroon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I honestly thought he might combust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed-up, down, up again-like he was trying to swallow a dozen questions at once, all of them jammed up in his throat like rush-hour traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton frowned. &#34;Mirabelle put a lot of thought into those gifts. The least you could do is say thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying thank you to me was clearly the last thing on Reginald&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face had gone from red to a deeply worrying purple. &#34;I-I didn&#39;t know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t prepare any gifts?&#34; Ashton cut in, voice sharp. &#34;Even after I told you I was bringing my wife here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let that word hang for effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cash will do. At least then I won&#39;t have to worry about you handing Mira something useless. There are five of you in your family, so two million each should be a good start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald&#39;s eyes bulged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was half worried he was about to burst a blood vessel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five? And what do you mean &#39;your family&#39;?&#34; Reginald&#39;s voice cracked like an old floorboard. &#34;It&#39;s six,including you. Aren&#39;t you my son? Aren&#39;t you supposed to be one of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re calling me your son?&#34; Ashton arched an eyebrow. &#34;Well then, since your son just got married,shouldn&#39;t you be giving a wedding gift? And since you skipped the engagement one, let&#39;s make up for lost time.Four million each should do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald was trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage or shock-l couldn&#39;t quite tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I did know this: he wouldn&#39;t make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had briefed me beforehand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d aIready shuffled the more useless Laurent cronies off the main board at LGH, parking them in dusty little side offices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald was currently languishing at Laurent City Estates, a subsidiary where he could do the least possible damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And, if need be, he could be shuffled farther away, like Burkina Faso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton held all the strings now, and Reginald knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he stood there fumbling between outrage and submission, a woman and a younger man approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was immaculate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expensive dress, impeccable hair, and a smile so sugary it almost matched my fake one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward like she&#39;d been waiting for her moment all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton&#39;s right,&#34; she said smoothly. &#34;As the in-laws, we should be the ones giving a proper gift to the new bride.Two million&#39;s a bit modest, though. Lucien-Ashton&#39;s cousin-just got engaged, and his parents gave the couple five million each. I&#39;m sure Ashton&#39;s wife is worth a lot more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t even look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just let the silence stretch, cool and cutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the way she clung to Reginald&#39;s arm, I knew exactly who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwendolyn Laurent. Reginald&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were perfectly polite, and she even sounded like she was sticking up for me, but I&#39;d met enough snakes in high heels to recognize the type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of woman who&#39;d backstab you with one hand and give your shoulder a reassuring pat with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Ashton hadn&#39;t said much about her during our briefing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I knew was that she was the one who&#39;d convinced Reginald to ship a barely-teenaged Ashton off to an overseas boarding school-alone, underprepared, and still too young to shave-while her own two sons were kept safe and coddled in Skyline City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded me of my mother,Caroline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different tactics, same poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that smnile-God,that smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me want to punch her square in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned towards Ashton as I beamed at Gwendolyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww, that&#39;s so sweet of you. You&#39;re really giving me five million? I don&#39;t even know what to say.&#34;</p>
