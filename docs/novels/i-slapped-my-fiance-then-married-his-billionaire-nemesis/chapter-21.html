                <p>The Laurent family estate sat alone on top of a private hill, as if it thought it was too good to share real estate with the rest of us. The only way up was a winding mountain road that made my stomach do backflips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, all anyone in Skyline could talk about was the elusive Laurent heir-as if he were the second coming of Gatsby, but with better hair. I&#39;d heard his name so many times it started to feel like subliminal messaging. At this point, I had to see what all the fuss was about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traffic on the way up was a nightmare-Skyline&#39;s elite crawling up the mountain like glittery ants in black-tinted SUVs. We weren&#39;t even at the top when Yvaine told the driver to pull over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got out first. I followed, tugging my dress down an inch-not that it helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically, I should have arrived with Ashton to sell the whole engagement thing. But he&#39;d texted to say he&#39;d be running late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine hooked her arm through mine as we walked up the rest of the way on foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress she picked for me was... bold. A silver slip covered in enough rhinestone fringe to double as a disco ball. Definitely not my usual style, but tonight wasn&#39;t about subtlety. The thing clung to me like a second skin, sparkling even in the patchy mountain moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the slit? Let&#39;s just say one wrong move and I&#39;d be charged with public indecency. I&#39;d paired it with silver stilettos that made my calves look deadly and my ankles sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my hair pinned up and a pearl clip at the back, I almost passed for classy.Almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we reached the Laurent gates, I was trying not to stare but-bloody hell. Even the door was smug. A giant wrought-iron monstrosity with gold accents and enough marble to pave a Greek tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the Carlisles weren&#39;t exactly paupers. Yvaine&#39;s family practically ran Skyline&#39;s social scene, and her brother had been expanding the family empire as if Monopoly were a blood sport. Still, even she raised an eyebrow at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that... a fountain inside the gate?&#34; she whistled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.&#34;With flamingos. Real ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d barely stepped into the ballroom when the crowd turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads swiveled. Mouths parted. Champagne flutës paused mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine made quite the entrance. She wore a strapless red dress that hugged her like it had stock in her waistline,and I figured I didn&#39;t look too shabby, either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned the room for Ashton. No sign of him. Just a sea of manicured women and Botoxed men pretending they weren&#39;t checking each other&#39;s net worth. I wondered which ones were Ashton&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d apparently decided this circus of a party was the perfect setting for me to meet his parents for the first ime-public enough so they wouldn&#39;t throw drinks or start interrogating me in full CIA mode. Crowded enough that any &#34;nice to meet you&#34; would be short, polite, and over before I had a chance to trip over someone&#39;s surname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nhile Yvaine and I were busy scanning the crowd, the crowd was busy scanning us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nomen looked like they were either about to compliment us or commit a hate crime. Men stared like they vere seeing cleavage for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s Yvaine Carlisle-Carlisle family heiress,&#34; someone whispered behind me. &#34;But the one next to her?Nho is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle Vance,&#34; someone else chimed in, sounding way too smug about it.&#34;She&#39;s marrying Rhys Granger.Nedding&#39;s coming up soon. No wonder she&#39;s glowing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pfft, glowing my arse. Everyone knows she&#39;s just clinging to Rhys. He doesn&#39;t even like her. Got someone else on the side, apparently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Please. Mirabelle Vance is a nobody. Even her own family doesn&#39;t back her. She&#39;s just some barista,right?_atching onto Rhys is the only thing she&#39;s got going for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ladies were whispering like we didn&#39;t have ears. Low voices, but not low enough. Every word floated straight over to us like smoke from a bad barbecue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine&#39;s eyes snapped up. She took one look at the group and started striding over as if she was about to stage a very well-dressed homicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yvle,&#34; I grabbed her wrist. &#34;Not here. It&#39;s the Laurents&#39; party. If you deck someone in this ballroom, we&#39;ll be blackHsted from every gala tifl we&#39;re sixty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed. &#34;They&#39;re the ones running their mouths. If this bloody dress weren&#39;t so tight, Pd be over there turning cheeks into handprints.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relatable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t mad. Not really. Their gossip was so off-script it wasn&#39;t even offensive-it was just outdated. The real social sharks would already know Rhys and I were done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although... Rhys probably hadn&#39;t told anyone. Definitely not Louisa. And definitely not the family friends who&#39;d rat him out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if there was one thing Rhys Granger couldn&#39;t stand, it was the idea that I walked away first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you just going to let them get away with it?&#34; Yvaine seethed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used to swallow that crap. Every side-eye, every whisper, every woman who told me l&#39;d never be enough for him. I swallowed it because | thought Rhys was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Newsflash: he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I picked up a glass of juice from the drinks table-cranberry, pretty and dangerous-looking-and strolled over to the cackling hens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who&#39;d been talking the most stood dead center, buried in a lavender tulle monstrosity. Pearls everywhere. Big ones. Like she&#39;d raided her grandma&#39;s jewelry box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they saw me, they went silent. Blinked. Smiled as if they hadn&#39;t just been slandering me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled too, and held out the glass to Miss Lavender. &#34;I would&#39;ve offered you soap, but since I don&#39;t carry that in my clutch, you&#39;ll have to make do with cranberry juice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t take it. Just stared at the glass as if it was about to bite her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move. Just stood there, hand extended. Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few people turned to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move a muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was on my face must have told her that this wasn&#39;t a bluff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t take the juice, I&#39;d pour it over her blowout without blinking.</p>
