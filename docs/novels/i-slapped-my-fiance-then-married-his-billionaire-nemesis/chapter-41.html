                <p>I was about to say no, thanks, we&#39;re not that kind of married, but his voice had that corporate don&#39;t-argue undertone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got in the car. &#34;Thanks. Appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just hummed-barely a sound-already turning the key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made it to the next block before he added, like it was some offhand comment, &#34;It&#39;s no trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That chiselled, unreadable side profile gave nothing away. Same as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment we walked out with that marriage certificate, he hadn&#39;t shown a single flicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No awkward laughs, no nervous tics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the same ice-cold poise he probably used to fire underperforming staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It weirdly helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he treated this marriage like a business transaction, the easier it was to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No romantic pressure. No messy feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just...clean lines and clear boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he said, still eyes on the road, &#34;We&#39;re married.Driving my wife isn&#39;t exactly going above and beyond And you don&#39;t need to call me Mr. Laurent anymore.Just use my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright... Ashton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been to the Granger house more times than I could count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their housekeeper,Darlene,recognized me right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door with a polite smile and a soft,&#34;Miss Vance,&#34; like we were old family friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in and have a seat, dear. I&#39;ll go fetch Mrs.Granger. She&#39;s just been discharged from the hospital.I know she&#39;ll be thrilled to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I said, settling on the nearest sofa and ignoring the smell of money and over-scented candles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even get a sip of water before Willow Granger came swanning down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face dropped the second she saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing here? Rhys doesn&#39;t even live here anymore. If you&#39;re looking to throw yourself at him, you&#39;re at the wrong address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here for Rhys. I came to see Aunt Louisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only made her scowl harder.&#34;My mum? Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I look like I&#39;m joking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like one of those pathetic women who can&#39;t keep their boyfriend in check, so they go crying to mummy for backup. What, hoping she&#39;ll slap some sense into him again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again? Did Louisa slap Rhys?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow stepped closer, narrowing her eyes. &#34;Last time,Mum gave Rhys a proper bollocking in the hospital.Isn&#39;t that enough? Are you here to open another can of worms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you calling yourself a worm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow looked thrown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when I still thought pleasing Rhys was a viable strategy, I had gone out of my way to be friendly with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I wasn&#39;t smiling and simpering, she looked at me like I&#39;d grown a second head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stomped the rest of the way down and zeroed in on the box I&#39;d placed on the coffee table. &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before | could say a word, she reached out and flipped the lid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared down at the brooch inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, and she just stood there gawping at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s... a really pretty brooch. Looks kinda... familiar.&#34;Then it hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Isn&#39;t this the heirloom thing my family gave yours when you and Rhys got engaged?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t confirm or deny. Just let her stew in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow, of course, decided that meant		and picked it up without asking for permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held it up to the light. Squinted. Gasped a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she remembered she hated me and slapped on her best suspicious face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s why you&#39;re here. You&#39;re trying to use this to guilt-trip my mum, get her to force Rhys into staying with you. Bet you dragged your parents into it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the brooch down, then launched into her big speech. &#34;You don&#39;t have to push him so hard,you know. Rhys will marry you. He said he would. That should be enough. He might not love you anymore,but at least he&#39;s doing the decent thing. You should just close one eye to him and Catherine, and you can still be my sister-in-law. You&#39;ll be the official Mrs.Granger everybody acknowledges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her in amazement.&#34;God,the way you say that-makes it sound like I&#39;m the mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned an awkward shade of pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she wanted to say something clever but couldn&#39;t find the script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow muttered after a beat, &#34;Catherine came first.She and Rhys... they&#39;re meant to be. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s interfering.Besides, Rhys wouldn&#39;t have looked elsewhere if he were happy at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pissed me off more than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smug little philosophy baked into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been such an idiot,hadn&#39;tl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting myself into knots to be nice to this girl-this moral vacuum in designer boots-because | thought it would help with Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached out and took the brooch straight from her hand. &#34;Save your lecture. Rhys and I are over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d barely finished the sentence when she scoffed loud enough to wake the dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah right. You&#39;re obsessed with him. Everyone knows you&#39;d do anything to get him back. This is just your latest scheme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow flounced onto the sofa like she&#39;d just won something and was waiting for her prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both waited in tense, sparkly silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel her watching me from the corner of her eye,like I was about to pull a rabbit-or a prenup-out  of my handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Louisa appeared at the top of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d only just been discharged from the hospital, but she looked better than I&#39;d expected-fresh lipstick,silk scarf, no IV drip in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle! I&#39;ve been meaning to call you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped to the familiar-looking box in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps slowed.</p>
