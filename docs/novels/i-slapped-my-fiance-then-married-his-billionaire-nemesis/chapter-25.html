                <p>&#34;So who&#39;s the poor girl you&#39;ve tricked into getting engaged to you without telling anyone?&#34; Regínald demanded. &#34;The least you can do is introduce her.&#34;⑤</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald Laurent. Ashton&#39;s biological father. Walking proof that money couldn&#39;t buy competence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked the part-mid-forties, still in decent shape, sharp enough jawline-but inside? Empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Skyline City knew old man Edouard, king of Laurent Global Holdings, would rather set fire to his empire than hand Reginald the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy didn&#39;t have the grit. Never had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Reginald knew it too. Maybe that was why he spent most of his time punching down, taking out his insecurities on people who couldn&#39;t punch back. Like young Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Ashton used to care. Used to wonder why his father treated him like something scraped off a shoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those days were dead and buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t even look up from his laptop. He had a conference call with London, Paris, and Frankfurt in two minutes. Reginald barging in, as usual, wasn&#39;t enough to break his focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s here at the party. You&#39;ll meet her soon enough,&#34;&#39; Ashton said, voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Ash, what your father means is, we don&#39;t know anything about her,&#34; Gwendolyn Laurent chimed in.&#34;I mean, sure, we know her name and that she&#39;s a...&#39; Her mouth twisted like she was chewing glass, &#34;a barista. But are you sure this is the right match? You need a wife who can handle the mayor&#39;s galas, investor dinners, charity auctions. Is a barista really going to survive in our world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton finally looked up, pinning her with a stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was. Fake concern, real agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwendolyn wasn&#39;t worried about his sudden engagement. She was thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton marrying a &#39;nobody&#39; meant her precious son, Declan, might actually stand a chance. In her twisted day/dreams, Declan wasn&#39;t just going to inherit Laurent Global Holdings, he was going to snatch Titanova Corp out from under Ashton too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton shut his laptop with a click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether she&#39;s up to the job is none of your concern. And I didn&#39;t ask for your worthless opinion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald&#39;s nostrils flared. &#34;She&#39;s your mother! Show some respect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step-mother,&#34; Ashton said, dragging out the first syllable like he was scrubbing it with sandpaper.&#34;And while we&#39;re on the subject, I didn&#39;t ask for yours, either.&#34;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit the intercom. &#34;Gareth. Get them out. Whoever let them in-dock his pay for three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, boss,&#34;&#39; came Gareth Stone&#39;s dry reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty seconds later, the head of Ashton&#39;s security detail walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Laurent,&#34; Gareth said, holding out an arm. &#34;This way, please.&#34;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald opened his mouth like he was about to argue, then caught the look in Ashton&#39;s eyes and thought better of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the study door closed, Ashton patched through his international call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Titanova Corp usually ran like a well-oiled machine, but certain things-like shady local governments and militia groups who thought bribes were a national sport-still needed his personal attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, he wrapped up the call, adjusted his suit with a sharp tug, and was about to head downstairs when Dominic Everett, his assistant,hurried in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She here?&#34; Ashton asked,already knowing the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic, used to Ashton&#39;s one-track mind where Mirabelle Vance was concerned, nodded. &#34;Miss Vance has arrived.&#34;&#39; Hehesitated, then added, &#34;But there&#39;s been an... incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s... ah, fighting someone in the ballroom. As in, actual fistfight. Not a verbal argument.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw tightened. His entire expression darkened like someone had switched off the lights inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed past Dominic without a word and stormed towards the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian Langford, looking half-asleep and rubbing his face like he&#39;d just lost a brawl with his pillow, caught up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all the noise downstairs?&#34;&#39; he asked, voice stilI scratchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his friend didn&#39;t answer, Cassian jogged after Ashton but almost crashed into his back when Ashton abruptly stopped at the landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Ashton&#39;s line of sight, Cassian peered down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bloody hell,&#34;&#39; he muttered, eyes widening. &#34;When you invited me to the party, I didn&#39;t know it was going to be gladiator-style.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ballroom was chaos. Guests scrambled back, forming a rough ring around the brewing disaster in the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton recognized Mirabelle&#39;s friend Yvaine, who&#39;d just kicked Catherine square in the gut. Not hard enough to do real damage-she was in a dress that was more for show than combat-but it was enough to block Catherine from throwing herself in front of Serenna like a discount bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine seized her moment. Tears poured down her face like someone had flipped a switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira, I was only trying to help,&#34; she sobbed. &#34;You pulled the tablecloth and knocked over the buffet by accident. I was just helping you pick up the pieces. Why would you hit me? And Serenna was only trying to help,too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of her cronies, already planted at the party like bad weeds, caught her frantic glances. They rushed over to back her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just go around hitting people!&#34;&#39; one of them screeched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, what the hell? This isn&#39;t a bloody food market!&#34;&#39; another barked, full Karen mode activated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine, scrappy but outnumbered, started looking boxed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ashton could even blink, Mirabelle moved. She stormed up, grabbed Catherine by the hair like she was yanking weeds, and slammed her halfway to the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re pulling. You set this whole thing up, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers twisted harder. Catherine whimpered. Mirabelle didn&#39;t let up. With her other hand, she still had a death grip on Serenna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screams and curses bounced around the room. Everyone else was freaking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t see any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood on the stairs, fists clenching, watching Mirabelle-tiny, furious, unstoppable-pinning two grown women like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms looked slim, but damn, she was strong. Catherine and Serenna couldn&#39;t even lift their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle held herself like a queen. Her spine was straight, her chin tipped back slightly, the diamonds around her neck catching the chandeliers and tossing the light back like a thousand tiny knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made dragging two idiots across a ballroom look... weirdly attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you grinning like an idiot?&#34; Cassian pointed at Ashton&#39;s face. &#34;Does a catfight turn you on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton touched his face. He hadn&#39;t even realized he was smiling.</p>
