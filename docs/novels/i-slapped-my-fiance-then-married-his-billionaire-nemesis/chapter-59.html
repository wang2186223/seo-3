                <p>The second Rhys and Catherine vanished from Yvaine&#39;s party, the vibe bounced right back as if they&#39;d never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine was in her element, gliding from group to group like she&#39;d grown up on a champagne tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed too loud,hugged too many people, and somehow remembered everyone&#39;s dog&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her birthday, after all, so every time someone raised a glass, she drank like it was her duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept an eye on her between sips of my own watered -down cocktail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Cassian had parked himself beside me with a drink he didn&#39;t touch and a smile that was trying a little too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked where I was from, what I did, whether l preferred Cosmopolitan or Old Fashioned-but he wasn&#39;t fooling anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew, and he was dying to get the story behind why his good friend Ashton had suddenly decided to wife me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I played dumb, smiled sweetly, and answered every question without telling him a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the party finally broke up. Yvaine found me.clung to my arm, and slurred, &#34;I&#39;m taking you home,babe. Come on. My car&#39;s... somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Yvie, I&#39;ve had, like, three drinks.You can barely spell your own name right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian peeled her off me. &#34;I&#39;ll take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, but don&#39;t worry about me. It&#39;s late and I&#39;m not even on your way. I&#39;ll just grab a cab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated. &#34;Ash asked me to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Positive. Good night, Yvie. Goodbye, Cassian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ordered a ride and headed back to Oakwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There used to be just two guards at the front gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now there were five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All burly, all alert, and all apparently recognized me by the head tilt they gave me as I passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had hired them after Rhys barged his way into the building last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he was off on some last-minute business trip, he still made sure Cassian was keeping an eye on me at Yvaine&#39;s party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still had security beefed up at the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never said a word about it, though. Just did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t drunk much, but by the time I got upstairs, the night hit me all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stripped, showered, and flopped straight into bed without setting an alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the weekend, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to the sun roasting my face and my phone shrieking like a banshee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squinting, I fumbled around until I saw the name on the screen: Savannah Lane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sobered me up real fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah never called me on weekends, not unless the building was on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swiped to answer.&#34;Savannah-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle Vance! Where the hell are you?! I&#39;ve called you three times. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re still in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two missed calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean...technically, yes. It&#39;s Saturday, so-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s bloody Sunday!&#34; she shrieked. &#34;And in case your beauty sleep turned you into a goldfish, today is the day Eliza Black comes in to review the new jewelry pitch. You&#39;re at home? In your pajamas?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot up so fast I nearly dislocated something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone screen helpfully reminded me: Sunday,10:42 a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought she was coming tomorrow, Monday-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you they changed the date. Last week. She&#39;s a global A-lister. Mira, and she-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More like B-lister,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and listen! She cleared her schedule for Nyx Collective. She&#39;s here right now! You think she&#39;s going to wait around because you needed an extra lie-in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No-I mean yes-l didn&#39;t get the update, I swear-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save it.&#34; Her voice cut clean through my panic. &#34;You want this project? You want your name on Eliza Black&#39;s red carpet looks? Then get your arse in here now. You&#39;re the best designer I&#39;ve got. Don&#39;t blow this because you slept through a calendar change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click. She was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there, stunned for about five seconds, then scrambled out of bed, tripped into my slippers, and raced to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t seen any reschedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No email. No message. Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d sworn it was set for Monday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had screwed with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way that update just magically skipped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone-cough Violet bloody Lin cough-had made sure I was left out of the loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t have time to sit around cursing her name and plotting her slow demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d pulled three all-nighters for that pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood,sweat,and not nearly enough coffee went into that deck</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missing this meeting wasn&#39;t an option, not unless l wanted to kiss my shot at real industry cred goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I barreled intoNyx Collective, it was past eleven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every designer had already shown their proposals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliza Black&#39;s agent was halfway out the door,throwing Savannah a look that said &#34;wrap it up or I&#39;m walking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah had begged. Negotiated. Maybe offered up her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the agent had relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes, no more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made it into the conference room on the final minute of that countdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a mess-sweaty from sprinting up five flights of stairs, hair wild like l&#39;d just crawled out of a wind tunnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blouse was sticking to my back, and I couldn&#39;t feel my left leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliza Black was perched at the front of the room in head-to-toe black, a designer mask covering most of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just her eyes were showing, sharp and watchful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked exactly like she did on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now, she wasn&#39;t smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the grinning, bubbly pop princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This Eliza was ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,silent, judgmental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And probably five seconds away from standing up and walking the hell out.</p>
