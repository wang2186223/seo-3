                <p>Cassian held his hands up again. &#34;Alright, alright.Don&#39;t bite my head off. I&#39;m just saying, if this isn&#39;t just another PR stunt and she&#39;s actually your wife-wife,then I should get to know her. She&#39;s gonna be part of your life, which means she&#39;s gonna be part of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t respond. His silence gave Cassian room to keep digging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, yeah. I asked. Prodded a bit. And... I gotta be honest, man, I don&#39;t think she feels the same about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian pressed on. &#34;She didn&#39;t seem to remember Florence. Or Eindhoven. At least, not the way you remember them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t flinch, didn&#39;t blink, didn&#39;t react at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cassian had known him long enough to spot the way his shoulders lowered just a fraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t tell her, did you?&#34; Cassian asked, more gently now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell her what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you love her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton turned away without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The skyline pulsed under him, this city he&#39;d once sworn off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d come back anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t,&#34; he said finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the fuck not? If I like a girl, I tell her. &#39;Oi, be my girlfriend. Done. If I&#39;m dumb enough to want to marry her-God forbid-I&#39;ll just say it. But you? You&#39;ve been circling her like a damn border collie. You, of all people. Mr &#39;You&#39;re fired&#39; before the coffee&#39;s cold.Now you&#39;re moving like every step migh blow up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton finally turned. &#34;If you were carrying a fifteenth-century Flemish reliquary, one-of-a-kind,irreplaceable, would you be sprinting with it?&#34; He let that sit for a beat. &#34;Didn&#39;t think so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian groaned, dragged a hand down his face.&#34;Jesus.Mirabelle&#39;s not a fragile relic, Ashton. She&#39;s a woman.A pretty tough one at that. You&#39;re acting like she&#39;ll crack if you breathe too hard near her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t want to scare her off.&#34; Ashton&#39;s voice dropped lower, rougher. &#34;She&#39;s not ready. Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until he&#39;d erased Rhys Granger from every inch of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers curled against the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same fingers that had once skimmed her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same ones that had memorized the curve of her waist, the softness of her thigh, the exact moment she&#39;d stopped pulling away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now they twitched like they wanted to smash something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preferably Rhys&#39;s jawbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian looked at him sideways. &#34;You planning on waiting forever?&#34;</p>
