                <p>Ashton watched her bolt into the house, all flailing limbs and flushed cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a short, low laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Gino, who was still hovering by the car door. &#34;Next time, don&#39;t drive so bloody fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver nodded.&#34;Yes,boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t argue the obvious-that Ashton was usually the one barking at him to step on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He valued his job, and his kneecaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton walked into the house, loosening his tie as he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle was already upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably in her bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably thinking about the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took the stairs two at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would her door be locked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she open it if he knocked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind was already undressing her again-he hadn&#39;t even taken off her shoes earlier, and the thought was driving him insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickened his pace, rounded the corner-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton froze mid-step, jaw tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yanked the phone out of his pocket, saw the name flash on the screen, then glanced back at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then down at the raging hard-on in his trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a muttered curse, turned on his heel, and stalked to the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed behind him hard enough to rattle the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Ashton stood by the window, the overhead light catching the hard angles of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held the phone to his ear like he wanted to crush it.&#34;What.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been? You&#39;ve been dodging my calls all day,&#34; Reginald snapped. &#34;The Harbourview District mess. What are you planning to do about it?And when are you planning on notifying the board?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harbourview&#39;s not your concern,&#34; Ashton said.&#34;Stick to the branch office. You run Laurent City Estates,not LGH.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget, I still hold shares in LGH. And Harbourview&#39;s a major deal. I told you and that Langford boy-both too green, too eager-that this would blow up in your faces. Now look. I heard the scaffolding collapsed in the wind and hit a guard. If even l&#39;ve heard of it, half the city probably has by now. Are you trying to get us sued?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw flexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought of the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fluorescent lights buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stench of antiseptic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dull beeping of machines doing what a broken body couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ramon Vega-thirty-four, married, father of two-had taken the full weight of a twisted scaffold bar across the side of his skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skull fracture. Internal bleeding. Coma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No prognosis yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t the wind,&#34; Ashton said evenly. &#34;I was on-site within the hour. That frame didn&#39;t buckle from gusts. The welds gave out. Shit materials.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had greased the wrong palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d known it the second he&#39;d seen the bent beams.Steel like aluminum foil. Cracks running through weld seams like veins in dry clay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way it was up to code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Cassian had pulled an all-nighter, elbows deep in supplier logs, invoices, shipping manifests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half the structure would&#39;ve crumbled if someone sneezed,&#34; Ashton said. &#34;I shut it down. Full audit&#39;s underway. We&#39;re reordering materials. There will be delays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delays? You think the city will accept that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll have to. I&#39;d rather take the hit on the timeline than have another body bag on site. If that&#39;s a problem for the board, they can bring it up at the next vote.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald simpered. &#34;You&#39;ve got a lot on your plate. If you can&#39;t handle this, maybe I should come back and supervise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hard-on was long gone, and in its place, a headache was settling in nicely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. I&#39;ll bring you back. You can personally check the stability of every single scaffolding pole. Daily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I was thinking more of a management position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald spluttered on the other end. &#34;I&#39;m your father! You think I&#39;ve got the stamina for that kind of grunt work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wanted to be involved. I&#39;m making that happen.I&#39;ll have the appointment letter drafted by morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No-no, wait, forget it, I&#39;m good where I am...&#34;Reginald backpedaled fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might&#39;ve been arrogant, but he wasn&#39;t suicidal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One full day on-site and he&#39;d be carried out in a body bag-or at least a neck brace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a government project,&#34; he switched tactics,his tone suddenly cautious. &#34;The press already caught a whiff of it. Some trash blogs are reporting it.If this trends, stock will drop. You should&#39;ve killed the story the second it broke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s patience snapped clean in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My priority was keeping the man alive. If he dies, no headline in the world is big enough to bury that.And in case you missed it, l&#39;ve already shut the story down. I&#39;m tracking every post, every feed. I don&#39;t need you playing PR consultant over the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to hang up when Reginald whined,&#34;You don&#39;t respect me. Not a bit. Look how you talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton tilted his head, rolling his neck until it cracked. &#34;How I talk to you depends on how you act.You get what you give.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another beat of breathing. Then Reginald sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. WWhatever. Anyway, we&#39;ve been asking you to come back for dinner. Not me-your grandfather.He asked for you himself. You ignoring him now too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His birthday&#39;s coming up. I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least you&#39;ve got some manners left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton paused, then added flatly, &#34;One more thing.Thought I&#39;d give you a heads-up. I&#39;m married. I&#39;ll be bringing her with me. If anyone so much as pulls a face at her, I swear I&#39;ll burn the place down with all of you still inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up before Reginald could open his mouth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shifted to the study door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three doors down was Mirabelle&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showering,maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or lying in bed, scrolling through videos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or... just sitting there, stewing, wondering why the hell he hadn&#39;t come knocking yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every muscle was strung tight, like he&#39;d just done a full set of deadlifts with no rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The craving was physical now-crude, annoying,sharp-edged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled, as if trying to bleed the tension from his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he rang Cassian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still work to clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ramon Vega&#39;s status needed following up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic had better have an update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legal team needed marching orders-start prepping charges for that rat bastard in procurement who&#39;d pocketed kickbacks and ordered garbage-grade steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If criminal negligence didn&#39;t stick, they&#39;d find something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth was, he should&#39;ve dealt with it all hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Octavia Grey had given him one window-tonight or not at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he&#39;d made the dinner happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And after what Mirabelle had pulled in the car-sliding into his lap like she lived there, mouth hot and greedy on his, fingers threading through his hair-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah. He&#39;d do it again in a heartbeat.</p>
