                <p>I thought I&#39;d already relaxed enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I were any more relaxed, I&#39;d be in a bloody coma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with the hug? Not intimate enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my arms around him like I was trying to crack his ribs, then buried my face deeper into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And accidentally breathed right into his pec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shirt warmed up instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fantastic. Now my embarrassment had body heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke again, low and close: &#34;You&#39;re standing too straight. Too stiff. And the way your arms are locked around me... it feels like you&#39;re trying to arrest me,not hug me. Maybe we should try sitting down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretty sure that was the first performance reviewv I&#39;d ever gotten on a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yeah, it didn&#39;t exactly earn five stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled up my sleeves, channeled my inner overachiever, and marched to the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in, flung my arms around his neck. &#34;That good enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted my arm. &#34;Feels like there&#39;s still room for the Michelin Man between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. Because apparently bending like a folding chair-arms looped around his neck, torso angled halfway to Narnia-wasn&#39;t the picture of intimacy he had in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recoiled and leaned back in again, this time trying to press my chest against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sort of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, my legs wanted no part of the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I stood there like a decapitated Barbie, upper body engaged, lower body on strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my thighs were beginning to scream bloody murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peeled off him. &#34;Maybe we call it a night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. We don&#39;t have a lot of time. And this isn&#39;t going to fool anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him. &#34;It&#39;s your grandfather&#39;s eightieth. It&#39;s not like we&#39;ll be expected to make out in front of the cake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but we&#39;re also not supposed to look like the honeymoon&#39;s long over and we&#39;re already lawyering up for the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what my hug looked like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton nodded. &#34;We could get Geoffrey or the staff in here to give feedback,if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Absolutely not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been nothing but patient with me-hadn&#39;t asked for anything but this: a simple, convincing appearance at his grandfather&#39;s party</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I kind of needed him to return the favor with my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,yeah. The fake intimacy thing had to look real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Screw it,&#34; I muttered, then hiked a leg over and straddled him. &#34;How&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth curled against my temple, just enough for me to feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped an arm around my waist and tugged me closer. &#34;That&#39;ll do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that didn&#39;t satisfy him, I was officially out of ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes intimacy isn&#39;t about physical space or contact,&#34; he murmured. &#34;It&#39;s about trust. You&#39;ve got to trust me completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm.&#34; I gave him the world&#39;s most non-committal grunt.He was right, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But knowing something&#39;s right and doing it are two very different things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded me of this game we used to play at summer camp, some team-building trust exercise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coach made us line up in pairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First row would fall backward without looking, and the row behind was supposed to catch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even after ages of mental prep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl behind me was one of my best friends, and still, I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she blinked and missed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she secretly hated me and this was the perfect chance to let me crash to the ground?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she wanted to prank me and pretended to let me fall before catching me last minute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more | thought, the more my body locked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this, sitting here with Ashton, somehow,it brought that whole memory screaming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except now, I wasn&#39;t even facing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was straddling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let me fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But some irrational part of me whispered: what if he suddenly stood up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if I hit the floor? Cracked my head on the coffee table?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squeezed my eyes shut and told my brain to shut the hell up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I had trust issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Ashton wasn&#39;t wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still didn&#39;t mean I could magically flip a switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or five years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled into his neck, &#34;Can I get up now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So we stayed there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stroked my back gently; he could tell I was still wired tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the longer I stayed, the stiffer I got, untilmy legs felt like tree trunks and a crick started forming in my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he said, &#34;That&#39;s enough for today. We&#39;ll pick it up tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great!&#34; I launched off him like a spring. &#34;I&#39;m going upstairs. Night.&#34;</p>
