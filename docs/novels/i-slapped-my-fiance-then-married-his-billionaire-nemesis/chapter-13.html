                <p>I answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louisa...&#34; | sounded sheepish, even to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could ghost Rhys with no regrets, but Louisa was a different story. She&#39;d always treated me like family-sometimes more than my actual family did-and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to be cruel to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was calling now, she probably already knew about the split. Either Rhys had miraculously grown a spine and told her, or he&#39;d been his usual cowardly self and she&#39;d sensed something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira.&#34; She cleared her throat like she was bracing herself. &#34;I know Rhys has been a complete idiot,but you&#39;ve been engaged for two years. The wedding&#39;s next month, sweetheart. This isn&#39;t the time to throw a tantrum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he did tell her. Color me shocked. Or maybe Catherine was the one who pushed him into it, like she did with everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to upset Louisa. I really didn&#39;t. But there were some hills a girl had to die on, and this particular hill had &#39;no to marrying a man who drools over his ex&#39;spray-painted all over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louisa, I think you already know what went down between Rhys and Catherine,&#34; I said, my voice as even as I could manage. &#34;They&#39;re perfect for each other.Honestly. He&#39;s always had a thing for her. It&#39;s best to let them get on with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira, don&#39;t be like this. I know you love Rhys.&#34; HHer voice was soft, almost pleading. &#34;I&#39;ll gve him a proper talking-to, get him to end things with... with that woman.Sweetie,I know you&#39;re hurting-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That cracked something in me. Just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, eyes stinging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been braced for Louisa to tear me a new one-for ruining the Granger name, for embarrassing Rhys in front of Skyline City&#39;s upper crust, for not playing my part as the dutiful almost-daughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of going full Cruella, she said I was hurting That she understood. And somehow, that made it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a long, tired sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t our first breakup rodeo. Back in the day whenever Rhys and I hit a rough patch, Louisa would swoop in with homemade cookies and guilt trips, and I&#39;d melt faster than ice cream at a barbecue. I could never stay mad when she looked at me like I was already part of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe that&#39;s what made me stick it out with Rhys for so long. I wasn&#39;t just trying to make it work with him-I was trying to honor her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, I&#39;d had enough of bending backward just to keep everyone else comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louisa, this isn&#39;t some one-off,&#34; I said, my voice steady even though my heart felt like it was chewing itself apart. &#34;Rhys never really let go of Catherine.Not then, and not now. It&#39;s only gotten worse. I&#39;m done pretending I&#39;m okay with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. Then her voice came back,thinner,raspier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marriage isn&#39;t some joke, Mira. I&#39;ve always seen you as my daughter-in-law. I mean that. I&#39;ll talk to Rhys. I will. I&#39;ll make sure he cuts ties with that woman. Please,darling, just give him one more chance. Even if it&#39;s just for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could visualize her through the phone-perched on her white leather sofa, the one she jokingly claimed was &#39;Italian but secretly from IKEA,&#39; hair in its usual glossy helmet, pleading like her entire life hinged on this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for a second, I wobbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apartment was full of half-packed boxes. My jewelry tools were stuffed into a cardboard wine case,and my coat was still hanging off the door like it hadn&#39;t decided whether to stay or bolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered exactly why I was moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered my mother threatening Yvaine&#39;s family business just to shove me into a forced engagement,while treating Catherine like the second coming of Beyoncé.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly, I wasn&#39;t wobbly anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I caved now, I&#39;d lose every shred of self-respect had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it this time, Louisa,&#34; I said slowly, each word deliberate. &#34;This isn&#39;t a tantrum. It&#39;s not a bluff. I&#39;m not marrying Rhys. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-but you and Rhys were fine just a few weeks ago.What happened? Are you seriously calling off the wedding?&#34; Her voice was shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made up my mind. I&#39;m not doing this out of spite,Louisa. It&#39;s not a phase. I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle!&#34; she cried, as if saying my full name would magically change my mind. &#34;I can&#39;t accept-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>BANG.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deafening crash burst through the phone speaker.I heard metal screaming against metal, the sound of everything going sideways in a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louisa?! What the hell-Louisa?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my phone so hard my hand went numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was more chaos-shouting, screeching, static-then the call cut out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach did a nosedive into my boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louisa?&#34; | called again, voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I redialed Louisa-no answer.Tried Rhys-nothing.Even called Clive Granger, Louisa&#39;s husband-voicemail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence on the other end wasn&#39;t just eerie. It was wrong.Really bloody wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart thudding like a drumnline on Red Bull, I grabbed my bag and phone and bolted. I smashed my phone against the doorframe on the way out-cue a loud &#34;shit!&#34;-then managed to drop my purse on top of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down to scoop everything up, hands shaking like I&#39;d just downed five espressos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call had ended way too suddenly, too violently.That crash-it didn&#39;t sound like bad signal or a phone dropped on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Louisa hurt? Was anyone with her? Had someone called emergency services?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain spun itself into a meltdown spiral while I tried -and failed-to shove my lip gloss, keys, and everything else back into my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so caught up in my internal catastrophe I didn&#39;t notice the lift ding or the footsteps approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until someone knelt in front of me and placed steady hands on my trembling shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
