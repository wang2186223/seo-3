                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw clenched so hard I thought he might chip a molar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his hands twitched, like he was dying to grab me but was trying to play it cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of us blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a Mexican standoff, except no one had a gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights had dimmed-had they always been that low?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stupid smart home probably detected horniness and adjusted the mood lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my ears,my chest pressed to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither was l.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both waiting for the other to make a move first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride&#39;s a bitch like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-fine.I cracked first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut my eyes, leaned in, lips inches from his, my breath ghosting across his skin-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jerked back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sat up ramrod straight. &#34;Um,your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled like he wanted to strangle someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ignore it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rang again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stabbed the screen to hang up, but whoever it was had octopus fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call came back instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glimpsed the name-Cassian Langford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might wanna pick up,&#34; I muttered, sliding off his lap and onto the other end of the sofa. &#34;If he&#39;s calling this late, it&#39;s probably something important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my legs, leaned back, and grabbed a throw pillow, as if it could absorb the residual heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton looked like he wanted to murder someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stabbed &#39;Answer.&#39; &#34;This better be life-and-death urgent or I&#39;m blocking you for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his expression shifted from murder-mode to tight-lipped concern in record time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Got it. On my way now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even wait to hang up before he was shrugging into his coat and heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something came up. I&#39;ve got to handle it. Might not be back tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. Go. Drive safe.&#34; I jumped up too fast,smacked my knee on the coffee table, and pretended I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His footsteps were already fading down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t catch what Cassian said, but judging by Ashton&#39;s face, it wasn&#39;t just a broken printer or someone crying over a spreadsheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the tail lights vanished down the driveway,I closed the door and pressed my burning cheek against the cool wood. &#34;Saved by the bell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian&#39;s call had come just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing Ashton shouldn&#39;t have been a big deal-in theory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in reality, I was suffering from sweaty palms,shaky hands, and a near brush with actually catching</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If we hadn&#39;t been interrupted right then, Ashton was about to find out I was the world&#39;s worst kisser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, I holed up in the study, sketching design mock-ups and trying not to keep checking my phone every five seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t come home last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally caved at lunch and texted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 5 pm, still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either the world had ended or he was knee-deep in something ugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my screen lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine. Dinner tonight. Want you to meet someone. I&#39;ll pick you up in an hour.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied:[Cool.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I dashed to my bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I say I spent twenty minutes in front of the wardrobe debating between &#39;business trophy wife&#39;and &#39;don&#39;t-fuck-with-me chic&#39;, I mean it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were more clothes in the closet than I could ever figure out what to do with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked a high-neck column dress-long, slinky,classy, and just tight enough to make men pause mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of dress that said, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve got a brain, but don&#39;t think for a second I&#39;m not aware of my ass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hair slicked back in a neat twist, face done up just enough to show I&#39;d made an effort,I checked myself in the mirror and gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wouldn&#39;t embarrass Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At six-thirty on the dot, a black Maybach rolled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was in the back seat when the driver opened the door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid in, smoothed my skirt over my thighs, and caught him staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes dipped, sharp and shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lingering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was &#34;calculating the probability of ripping this dress off in a private booth&#34; energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except, his jaw twitched, and he dragged his gaze back to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look... nice tonight,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head and gave him a smile, as if I hadn&#39;t noticed him nearly combusting across from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I tilted just enough so he could catch the glint of the Harry Winstons in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wore the earrings you gave me,&#34; I said. &#34;I haven&#39;t thanked you for them. The design&#39;s exquisite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34; His voice was lower this time.&#34;They look perfect on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to throw a compliment back, but what the hell was I supposed to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That he looked nice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wore a suit like it was tailored to his DNA.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And his face didn&#39;t need jewelry or makeup to sharpen its features-it came pre-sculpted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I went with, &#34;You look tired. Something happen at work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then immediately regretted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Genius conversationalist, Mira. Really killing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Rebel attacks in the Red Sea. Some of our ships had to be rerouted.&#34; Then he added, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that killed the husband-and-wife talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up outside one of those discreet,old-money restaurants that pretended to be low-key by charging four hundred dollars for a plate of air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took my hand and led me upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, who are we meeting?&#34; I asked. &#34;Business partner? A Laurent relative?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah. That didn&#39;t feel ominous at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a breath and gave myself the usual pep talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smile, nod, pretend to be the arm candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one can kill you if you look hot enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ashton opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused mid-stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in the booth, legs elegantly crossed, was none other than Octavia Grey.</p>
