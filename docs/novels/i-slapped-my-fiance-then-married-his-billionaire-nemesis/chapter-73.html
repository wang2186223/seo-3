                <p>The CEO&#39;s office was silent except for the knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic Everett stepped in, carrying a folder thick enough to strangle someone with. &#34;Mr. Laurent, this is everything on Nyx Collective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed it on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton picked up the folder, flipping through it without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each page, his jaw set a little tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he reached the middle, the muscle under his cheekbone was pulsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what Mirabelle had been dealing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Petty backstabbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being undercut by her own team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screamed at in meetings by people who couldn&#39;t even carry her shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking hell,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in his chair, report still in hand, his fingers tapping against one name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Rexford Caldwell-why does that sound familiar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He runs Titan Growth Fund, which invests in Nyx Collective, but he&#39;s not involved in the studio&#39;s day-to-day running. He asked to meet you last week,but your schedule was full.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; Ashton rubbed his chin. The name clicked now, &#34;Tell him I&#39;ll make time. Set it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Dominic left, Ashton reopened the folder,slower this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The report was more thorough than what Cassian had been able to find out from Yvaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the last section, some C-list actress was having custom jewelry made for a film festival in Italy, and that had started the whole row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Venice Film Festival next month. Are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end perked up instantly. courselam.Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you wearing jewelry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Duh. I&#39;m planning to kill it on the red carpet. The dress and the set are both exclusive pre-season drops from-wait for it-Amarante. I&#39;m the first celeb to wear them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return the jewelry. You&#39;re wearing mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She actually yelled. &#34;Since when do you make jewelry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t. My wife does. You&#39;ll wear her design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence. Long enough that he thought the line had dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, &#34;Ashton Laurent. Are you out of your mind? Or is this some kind of practical joke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Let&#39;s do dinner. I&#39;ll introduce you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up before she could argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>10:03 p.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hadn&#39;t moved from the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d eaten dinner alone-half a steak, three bites of salad, and enough scotch to strip varnish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d texted him at six, chirpy as hell: [Out wvith Yvaine.Might be back late!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back late, his arse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle didn&#39;t just &#39;casually&#39; go for drinks. She didn&#39;t do &#39;casual&#39; anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew a tactical retreat when he saw one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he&#39;d sent Cassian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bastard reported back with confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She invited Yvaine. Not the other way around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. So it was a retreat. Dressed up as a girls&#39; night out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d waited anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And waited some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, &#34;Get Carlisle out of there,&#34; Ashton barked into the phone. &#34;I want Mirabelle back. Now.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian let out a laugh that sounded more like a choke. &#34;Mate. You two are insane. I&#39;m not your goddamn messenger boy. If she wants to stay out, let her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click. Ashton tossed the phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the time again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>10:08 p.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she was dodging the rehearsal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was another possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worse one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she found out about the lie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No tragic tale of the poor bloke dragging his hired girlfriend to a family Christmas dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a story concocted entirely for Mirabelle&#39;s benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had no links to his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way she could&#39;ve found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This sudden night out was more likely just her way of saying no to the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no, Ashton wasn&#39;t going to let her off the hook that easily, not after the kind of night he&#39;d had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he closed his eyes, it was like being sucked back into that sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath warm against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh pressed under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs tangled with his like they had every fucking right to be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his dream, it didn&#39;t stop there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the hotel room-the one he hadn&#39;t told her he&#39;d bought after that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dream-Mirabelle was straddling him again, like that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single, scorching night she&#39;d taken the lead and made him forget his own damn name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dream-Ashton flipped her under him, just as fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around his back, gasped his name, pulled him closer like she didn&#39;t want him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in the dream, he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove himself into her like he had no brakes,and she clung to him like she wanted him to ruin her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He woke up pissed off and hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The duvet got kicked to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat glued his skin to the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two glasses of freezing water did nothing to cool him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended up in the kitchen, shirtless, hair a wreck,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>glaring at the marble counter like it owed him an apology</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still thinking about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wasn&#39;t going to get peace, then neither was she.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton called the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Cider &amp; Smoke was closing early tonight-health code violation, staff emergency, gas leak; the manager could pick a story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted her out of there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey poked his head into the living room.Laurent? Mrs. Laurent&#39;s back. Talking to the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should be inside any second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm.&#34; Ashton didn&#39;t glance up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes stayed on the tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand flicked the screen like he was reading something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been scrolling the same page for the last twenty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Geoffrey wasn&#39;t stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the way Ashton sat up straighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way his fingers smoothed the wrinkle out of his shirt like he hadn&#39;t been sitting there all night,simmering in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift was small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just slipped away, because he wasn&#39;t an idiot.</p>
