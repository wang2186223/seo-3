                <p>Mirabelle was holding up the hem of her nightgown with two fingers, her steps careful and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just bare feet on cold black stone, each step like a spotlight in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin looked warm against all that sleek obsidian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale. Almost glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s gaze tracked up the curve of her calves to the back of her thighs, then higher, past the sway of fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress clung to her hips and draped off her waist as if it had been designed for temptation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the thin material, he caught the outline of her spine, the dip where her back met her hips, the faintest tease of her-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast. Quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Teeth clenched, jaw locked, forehead against the wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking pervert,&#34; he muttered under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was supposed to be a grown man, not some hormonal teen hiding behind doors to stare at a woman&#39;s ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just stood there, breathing like he&#39;d run a mile, while she padded around downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he heard her coming back up, just as quietly as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the footsteps passed his room, he peeled away from the door, grabbed a towel, and marched straight into the en suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle was already there when Ashton came into the dining room the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d changed-yellow jumper, jeans, fluffy socks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cozy.Casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm in a way that made his throat feel tight again,and not because of lust this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked... comfortable. Like she&#39;d finally settled into this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned when she thought he wasn&#39;t looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to get up this early,&#34; he said,heading to the coffee machine. &#34;Got somewhere to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged. &#34;Nah. I&#39;m on leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard all about it from Cassian-the new project,the competition, the collegial rivalry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even knew her boss, Savannah something, had called her repeatedly in the past couple of days,trying to get her to come back to Nyx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle had said no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was her plan? To find another studio? Start her own? Take a sabbatical?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More to the point, when did she plan on telling him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the fact? Over dinner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe never?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pulled out a chair and sat across from her.&#34;Something happen at work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred her coffee..&#34;Nothing huge. Just needed a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a lie, obviously, but he didn&#39;t push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ate in silence for a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her over his toast. &#34;Got any plans today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Gonna swing by the law firm again.&#34; She gave him a quick smile. &#34;Your legal team&#39;s scary efficient.They emailed me last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; He nearly told her to have the meeting at the LGH building instead-preferably in his office-but held it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll catch up with Yvaine over tea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Geoffrey drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle glanced at the housekeeper, who beamed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a polite smile, then turned back to Ashton. &#34;Public transport&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t want to trouble anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You drive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Got my license in college.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then take one of the cars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fork paused mid-air. &#34;You mean one of those rare, probably one-of-a-kind cars in your garage? If I so much as scratched the bumper, I&#39;d have to sell a kidney just to cover the paint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, then frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He liked thnat she was comfortable enough to joke with him now, but he didn&#39;t like that she still saw the cars as his. Not hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely not theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. My mistake. Those have been sitting in the garage too long. Probably need a tune-up before they&#39;re road-ready. What do you like driving?I&#39;ll have one sent over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her fork like it had just bitten her. &#34;Um,no, thanks. Really. I barely drive. Like, ever. I&#39;d rather walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t have people seeing you on the subway and thinking I&#39;m some tight-fisted bastard,&#34; Ashton said smoothly. &#34;So either you drive yourself, or someone drives you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle shifted in her seat, trying to squirm out of it. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll drive myself... I&#39;ve still got that card your assistant gave me the other day. I&#39;ll buy something.Speaking of that-&#34; she added, &#34;I don&#39;t remember us agreeing on a million-dollar monthly transfer. Can you take it back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he said flatly, his tone edged with irritation.&#34;You&#39;re my wife. There&#39;s a certain image that needs maintaining. That means having a driver. A card that skips queues. VIP access. The works. Non-negotiable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t in the deal,&#34; she shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it not?&#34; he murmured, hiding a smug smile behind his coffee mug. &#34;Maybe check the contract.Section Five. Subclause twenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; she blinked, then muttered under her breath, &#34;I don&#39;t even remember where the hell i shoved that damn thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered, but he wasn&#39;t about to tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Geoffrey and said, &#34;Take Mrs. Laurent car shopping after breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; she jumped in fast. &#34;Really. There&#39;s no need.I don&#39;t know a damn thing about cars anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Then we&#39;ll have one delivered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which had been the plan from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle mumbled something to herself and gave in reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, she went upstairs to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton said to Geoffrey, &#34;Make sure she&#39;s comfortable with whatever you get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And... get one that comes as a pair. The &#39;his and hers&#39; type. Have mine delivered to the garage.&#34;</p>
