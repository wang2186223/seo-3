                <p>Ashton&#39;s mouth crashed into mine with no preamble,no warning, no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot, forceful, and absolutely unrelenting-he kissed like he owned my lips, my breath,my goddamn soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, trying to pull back, but he was already there, already taking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue pushed past the resistance of my lips like it had every right to be there, and maybe it did,because my body sure as hell wasn&#39;t protesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shot up instinctively, palms flattening against his chest-but instead of pushing him away they curled, gripping the fabric of his shirt as if it were the only thing keeping me tethered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton-wait, just-&#34; | tried to speak, but all I managed was a breathless jumble against his mouth,broken by the sheer force of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smooth, dizzying motion, he wrapped one arm around my waist and hauled me into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seat creaked beneath us, the whole car shifting slightly with the movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness swallowed us, the only light a faint,flickering neon glow bleeding through the tinted windows, casting him in sharp edges and shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his thigh under mine-hard,hot,tense-and then l stopped feeling anything else, because he kissed me again, deeper this time, like he was staking a claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs straddled his lap awkwardly, knees pressing into the leather seat on either side of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on top, technically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But somehow, that didn&#39;t mean anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every flick of his tongue, every greedy pull of his lips made it clear: I wasn&#39;t running this show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the backseat thinned, my lungs burning,my skin prickling like someone had turned up the temperature by ten degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The windows fogged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head swam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every nerve I had funneled into where we touched-his hands spanning my waist, fingers flexing like he was holding back from just tearing my clothes off;the press of his chest against mine, so firm it felt like being pinned beneath a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still he didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed him back because I couldn&#39;t not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because my body had already made the decision for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips moved with his, pliant, eager, like they belonged to someone else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt weightless and drunk, high on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smelled like clean skin and woody cologne,but there was something darker beneath it, something addictive-salt and sweat and heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time got weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forgot how minutes worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forgot the world outside the car even existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just him, just this, just the slick, obscene sound of our mouths clashing, and the low, hungry noise he made when I shifted slightly in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he finally let me breathe, my legs were jelly, my lips bruised, and my whole body felt boneless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slumped against his chest, panting, one handstill fisted in his shirt like I couldn&#39;t bear to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton exhaled, slow, controlled, but I felt the tension in his thighs, the not-so-subtle press of something hard beneath me that made my skin flush all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver coughed discreetly. &#34;Mr. Laurent, we&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot off Ashton&#39;s lap like I&#39;d touched a live wire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a low grunt, adjusted his suit jacket to hide the very obvious evidence of what had just happened-or almost happened-and stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he reached back in and scooped me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flailed, limbs everywhere. &#34;Put me down-l can walk-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment my heels hit the ground, my knees buckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wobbled sideways like a baby deer on ice, nearly twisting my ankle into a right-angled tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s arm shot out, catching me before I could fully embarrass myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still dizzy-high, really-from that kiss for was it kisses? That series of escalating, breath-stealing,life-shortening assaults on my self-control),seriously considered letting him carry me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But we weren&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was no doubt discreet-he worked for Ashton,after all-but I could practically feel the popcorn in his mental hand and the gossipy sparkle in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I patted Ashton&#39;s arm to tell him I was fine and that he should let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he did, I bolted into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me, I heard a low chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrambled up the stairs, half-limping, half-flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just ran to my room and flung myself face-first onto the bed, pulling the blanket over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips still tingled, swollen and slick, haunted by the memory of his mouth-demanding, consuming, like he was trying to suck the soul out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And God help me, I&#39;d let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I melted into him like butter on a hot skillet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine&#39;s voice rang in my head: &#34;Hot guy. No emotional baggage. Ride him like a stolen bike and get the glow-up your love life needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I&#39;d been clinging too hard to an outdated model-emotions first, sex later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Rhys, it had been all longing gazes and high-minded ideals, like I was in love with the concept of him more than the man himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No strings, no expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just heat. Hunger. A one-year contract and a man who kissed like he wanted to rewrite my DNA.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was time to reframe this whole fake marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Call it what it really was: a one-year stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I propped myself up on both elbows and stared toward the door.</p>
