                <p>Minutes later, Violet Lin sashayed back to her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smug little smirk said it all: she thought she&#39;d bagged the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed me, she let out a little scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she pulled something shady again? Probably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bite. Didn&#39;t even blink in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My proposal was solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But showing up late this morning was a stain l couldn&#39;t scrub off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I were Eliza Black, I wouldn&#39;t trust someone who couldn&#39;t read a clock either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty agonizing minutes later, Savannah stepped out of the office with her phone still in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the look on her face, she&#39;d just hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliza Black&#39;s people got back to us,&#34; she said,scanning the room. &#34;She picked Violet Lin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Violet gasped, one hand clapped to her cheek like she&#39;d just been proposed to. &#34;Eliza Black actually picked me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah nodded. &#34;Yes. Prep starts now. Contract&#39;s getting signed tomorrow. The budget&#39;s generous,and this project&#39;s top priority. Violet, build your team.Everyone else, give her full support. I want a completed design draft on my desk as soon as humanly possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Violet chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knew exactly what she was about to pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle,&#34; she said, sugary sweet. &#34;Be my assistant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assistant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was just a fancy word for errand girl in Violet&#39;s dictionary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind who fetches lattes and hauls garment bags up five flights of stairs because the lift&#39;s out-yeah,that kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen her pull this stunt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called it team building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called it hazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time, she ran some poor intern into the ground,sent her up and down the building so many times the girl nearly passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl quit the day after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would&#39;ve too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now she was trying it on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Savannah caught my eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything, just raised my brow a fraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it wasn&#39;t protocol for one designer to play lapdog to another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Violet got in first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This project&#39;s a big deal,&#34; she said, all sweet and reasonable. &#34;I just want to make sure there are no mistakes. Mirabelle, you&#39;re okay with helping out,right? If Eliza Black&#39;s happy, that&#39;s a win for all of us.Gotta think about the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah hesitated, lips pursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Violet&#39;s the lead, we&#39;ll go with her arrangement,&#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was flat, but her eyes flicked to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t thrilled either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad the client had already picked sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet was about two seconds away from gloating when I leaned back in my chair and said, &#34;Yeah, no.I&#39;m not doing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still fuming about the job being yanked from under me, and now Violet had the nerve to bounce over like a rabid cheerleader, trying to stick me with the grunt work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seniority. Skill. Portfolio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ticked every damn box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Nyx Collective, I wasn&#39;t just a designer-l was THE designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d rather jump in front of a moving bus than work as Violet&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood. &#34;Not happening. I&#39;m taking leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet blinked, fake-shocked. &#34;Oh, don&#39;t be dramatic.It&#39;s just one project. You&#39;re not seriously quitting because you don&#39;t want to assist me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she got all performative. &#34;If you were the lead designer and I had to assist, I&#39;d totally cooperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s cute,&#34; I said. &#34;But if I were the lead, I&#39;d rather rope in Paul the Octopus to help me sketch than let you anywhere near my project. At least he had better accuracy. And taste. Besides, I don&#39;t need this job badly enough to play your stooge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet didn&#39;t expect me to hit back that hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, and she slithered closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira, come on, we both know you need this job.You&#39;ve got no family backing you, and I heard the wedding with Rhys Granger got called off. If you lose this job too... how are you going to survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barked a laugh. &#34;Worried about me? Thanks, but save it. What you really need to worry about is yourself. When Eliza Black shows up in your design looking like a cautionary tale, you won&#39;t just be losing face like you did at the Laurent party. This time,it&#39;ll be international. Front row, high-def, full-on global humiliation. Should be fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my phone buzzed on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked it up, expecting some spam or another passive-aggressive group chat message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a text from the bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Account balance update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Counted the zeroes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two. Million. Dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the actual-?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I figured the bank had glitched or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like, maybe it accidentally thought | was Alice Walton for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another message buzzed through, this time from Dominic Everett, Ashton&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mrs. Laurent, Mr. Laurent has requested a new card be issued in your name. A monthly deposit of one million will be made as agreed. An additional million is Mr. Laurent&#39;s personal gift to you. Please confirm receipt.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the screen for two whole minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not blinking. Not breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As agreed&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had I agreed to receive a million dollars from Ashton?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And from the sound of it, this was going to be a monthly thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t marry Ashton for his money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, I barely listened to whatever he said in the dark hallway that day; I was too busy ogling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with two million just chilling in my account like it was pocket change, I couldn&#39;t lie-l felt it in my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money really did slap different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, I&#39;d always known Ashton was rich, but this was the moment it truly hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was now officially one of those people who could buy a whole boutique just because the salesgirl looked at me funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from me, Violet Lin waved a hand in front of my face. &#34;Earth to Mira. Why are you staring at your phone so hard? Trying to find another job already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked out of it, shoved my phone into my bag, and got to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Violet tried to block my path, I shouldered her aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the studio turned to gape at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot them all a look, grabbed my bag, and announced: &#34;I quit,bitches!&#34;</p>
