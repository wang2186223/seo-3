                <p>Next morning, I got up before sunrise, feeling like a guilt-ridden teenager after sneaking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Ashton hadn&#39;t noticed my entire performance last night, and I was not about to sit across from him at breakfast pretending | was a normal, functional human being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So yeah,I tried to sneak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tiptoed downstairs, shoes in hand, bag swinging at my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But guess what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the sofa like the king of the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirt sleeves rolled up like a casual threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nearly threw my handbag at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re up early,&#34; | accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over, expressionless. &#34;Where are you going this early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Busted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, attempting that fake innocence that only works on men who want to believe the lie. &#34;Yvaine wanted to do breakfast. I&#39;m just gonna...yeah,head out...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I edged toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, just as my fingers brushed the handle-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart plummeted straight into my shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marched right back across the room like I hadn&#39;t just been tiptoeing a second ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then I climbed into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straddled him, arms wrapped around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, maybe a little hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But mostly flair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing was off-limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hugging-I could do that blindfolded and drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in, brushing my cheek against his neck,whisper-close to his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is as far as I can go. For now. As for the other thing... maybe give me some time? I need time to mentally prepare. You&#39;re a man of action, but I&#39;m a girl with nerves. I need a heads-up before we go full lip-lock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed enough time to brush my teeth, drown myself in breath spray, and eat a hundred mints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More importantly, I needed time to warn myself not to shove my tongue down his throat or do something wildly inappropriate and irreversible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He literally stopped breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body stiffened, like someone had swapped his spine for an ironing board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just sat there, silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or disappointed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or silently going over our ironclad contract,searching for a clause that said, &#34;If fake wife misbehaves, fake husband gets to unleash legal hellfire&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided not to provoke him further. &#34;Let&#39;s leave it at this for today, yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled. His voice was low and rough. &#34;We&#39;ll talk tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool, cool.&#34; I bounced off his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I noticed him looking at me strangely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squinted back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his neck...red?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like, sunburn-at-midnight red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, I wondered if I&#39;d given him a love bite without realizing, but unless I&#39;d started sucking necks in my sleep, that wasn&#39;t it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you-?&#34; | was about to ask if he was allergic to my lip gloss when Carmen popped her head in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent, Mrs. Laurent, breakfast&#39;s ready.&#34; She gave me a sunny smile. &#34;Mrs. Laurent, I made that spicy chorizo scramble you like so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,Carmen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced longingly at the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then at Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved. &#34;Thought you had a breakfast date with Yvaine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It could also be a lunch date,&#34; I said.&#34;Or afternoon tea. Yvaine&#39;s very flexible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood. &#34;Let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I backed into the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night I&#39;d been so hungry I almost raided the pantry, but I stayed in bed like a good little fake-drunk idiot to avoid blowing my cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton tore a freshly toasted baguette in half and handed me one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slathered mine with strawberry jam and pushed the jar of paté toward him without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then it hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The domesticity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that this whole stupid, cozy, married-for-show breakfast ritual was starting to feel normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like | knew exactly how he liked his coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he knew I put jam on everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like we were just another boring couple havng breakfast-not two liars trapped in a high-stakes fake marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that freaked me out way more than kissing him ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, I locked myself in the study to work on BloomState drafts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey had cleared out the roomn just for me, and I&#39;d never been this productive in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at Nyx Collective, with every professional tool and software available, I hadn&#39;t worked this fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime in the evening, Ashton texted to say he wouldn&#39;t be home for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breath I hadn&#39;t realized I was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he walked through the front door twenty minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, &#39;not home for dinner&#39; didn&#39;t mean &#39;not home at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks for the clarity, CEO of Misleading Messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in the kitchen sipping water when I heard the door click open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fight-or-flight response kicked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping past the island, I tiptoed toward the stairs like a cartoon burglar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then I saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was sprawled across the sofa like a GQ centerfold-legs crossed, shirt slightly undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were locked on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scratched my chin and forced a grin. &#34;Uh... long day? You should go to bed early. Beauty sleep and all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His right hand dangled lazily over the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his index finger lifted, curling at me like he was beckoning a pet.&#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have said no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should have kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning I&#39;d noticed how soft his lips looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thin, precise, probably very kissable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kiss wouldn&#39;t kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, I was getting paid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two million sat in my bank account-that was enough motivation to treat him like a hot check with abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the pace and dropped myself onto his lap, like I did this every Tuesday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, this was not what he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said come here. I didn&#39;t say do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. We both know what &#39;come here&#39; means with you. Let&#39;s just get the rehearsal over with. I&#39;ve got sketches to finish.&#34;</p>
