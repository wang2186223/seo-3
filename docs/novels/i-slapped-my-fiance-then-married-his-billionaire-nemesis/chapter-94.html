                <p>The voice was high-pitched, clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sliced through the tension like someone had just popped a balloon in a silent church.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s head snapped around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kid couldn&#39;t have been more than seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a daffodil-yellow dress speckled with tiny white blossoms and had pigtails so neatly braided they looked vacuum-sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked right back at him, completely unbothered by the fact that every single adult was now gaping at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman bolted to her side and slapped a hand gently over the girl&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense, Freya,&#34; the woman hissed, frantic. &#34;You don&#39;t know anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a shaky smile in Ashton&#39;s direction. &#34;She&#39;s just a kid. She doesn&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her finish,&#34; Ashton said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s lips kept twitching like she wanted to protest, but all she could do was shut up and move to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freya jabbed a finger straight at Isobel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was playing out back just now. I saw you talking to that pretty lady, but she didn&#39;t wanna talk to you. She tried to leave, and you chased her. Then you slipped and fell into the pool, and you dragged her in with you.You lied!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;What? Isobel, is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a shaky smile. &#34;Of course it&#39;s not. She&#39;s just a kid. You know how kids are-they love making things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin seized on that like a drowning man to a rope. &#34;Exactly. She&#39;s six. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s saying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freya&#39;s eyes burned. &#34;I saw it!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped off her tiny crossbody bag, unzipped it with furious little hands, and pulled out a yellow phone covered in sparkly stickers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was filming a puppy in the yard and caught the whole thing by accident! Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Isobel&#39;s voice turned strangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton held out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freya handed over the phone obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence swallowed the room as Ashton watched the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Center screen: a playful Golden Retriever puppy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Top right corner: two figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle with her back turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel lunging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sidestep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel&#39;s hand latching onto Mirabelle&#39;s leg mid-fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both went under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton played it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he held up the phone to Isobel&#39;s face, pausing on the exact frame of her grabbing Mirabelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got anything to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel&#39;s throat bobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opened again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin rushed in before she could. &#34;Ashton, I didn&#39;t know, I swear. I just believed whatever she told me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I panicked!&#34; Isobel blurted, her voice shrill and pitched high. &#34;It happened so fast-l might&#39;ve tripped-I don&#39;t remember exactly. Mirabelle was beside me, I just... reacted! It was instinct! I didn&#39;t mean to drag her in, I swear-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lies tumbled out, quick and panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A moment ago, you stood here and made everyone believe Mirabelle pulled you in. I gave you the chance to tell the truth. You didn&#39;t take it. Not until the video exposed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the crowd collectively stopped breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than a few had been on the receiving end of that tone before-Ashton&#39;s calm, cold finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tone of a man delivering final judgment with no reprieve, no appeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel stood frozen, mascara beginning to crust at the corners of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Quentin, clutching his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin looked at her, confusion, betrayal, disbelief, irritation, all fighting for space on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he glanced at Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rock.Hard place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he never got the chance to choose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man and a woman stepped out from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s voice was brisk, clipped. &#34;She has nothing to do with Quentin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum!&#34; Quentin choked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; she snapped, then turned to Ashton, voice quivering with both fear and urgency. &#34;She&#39;s been playing us all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man yanked Quentin away from Isobel, gripping his arm tight. &#34;You&#39;re done with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quentin broke up with her,&#34; his mother added quickly. &#34;Didn&#39;t you, Quentin? She&#39;s nothing to do with us anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words had no effect on Ashton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked to Quentin, then to his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you hadn&#39;t brought her here, none of this would&#39;ve happened. She&#39;s the culprit. You&#39;re the accomplices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin&#39;s mother blanched at the implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed up to Isobel and slapped her hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You troublemaker,&#34; she spat. &#34;You dragged us into this mess. Now apologize to Ashton!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at Ashton, seeking approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap jolted Isobel out of her daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, dazed, struggling to process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she stammered. &#34;It&#39;s all my fault, I... I wasn&#39;t thinking-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife nearly drowned. And you think a &#39;sorry&#39; will cut it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel&#39;s mouth opened, but the words were tangled in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came another slap, sharp and stinging, landing on the back of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin&#39;s mother snarled. &#34;Try again! Say it like you mean it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Isobel&#39;s eyes. &#34;I swear, I&#39;m sorry. I was wrong-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Ashton said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin exchanged a desperate look with his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could feel it-Ashton wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tense breath, Quentin clenched his jaw, then kicked Isobel in the shin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get on your knees. Apologize to my cousin properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel gasped,eyes wide with shock.&#34;Quentin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quentin glanced at Ashton, who was still stone-faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kicked her again, harder this time, square in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel crumpled, crashing to the floor with a sick thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees scraped against the cold marble, breath knocked from her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed there a moment, hunched and shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, slowly, she pushed herself up to sit, trembling, slumped and disheveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s towering frame loomed above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where she knelt, he seemed a mile high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel clenched her fists, nails digging into her thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She stared at the floor. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have pushed Mirabelle. It was stupid. It was wrong. l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then raised a shaking hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And slapped herself across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin reddened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each strike cracked through the silence like a gunshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton scowled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this came close to atoning for what Mirabelle had endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire that had erupted in his chest the moment he saw Mirabelle half-submerged and gasping-it hadn&#39;t gone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fury that had built, second by second, as he listened to her broken voice, watched her struggle to speak, to move-none of it had eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of self-inflicted slaps and a stammered apology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not nearly enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle had almost died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes drilled into Quentin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t brought Isobel to the party-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid rushed downstairs, breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent! It&#39;s Mrs. Laurent, she-</p>
