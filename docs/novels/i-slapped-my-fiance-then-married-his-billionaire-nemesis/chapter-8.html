                <p>I stopped outside his door, took a deep breath like l was about to skydive without a parachute, and knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No going back now. Not unless I fancied throwing myself down the stairwell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open almost immediately, leaving me zero time to panic or bolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was-in a suit. A proper one. Not the kind you wear for a Zoom meeting or to make your ex jealous on Instagram, but the sort that whispered &#34;money&#34;and &#34;I don&#39;t queue for anything, ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was on his way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe a date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably with someone tall, elegant, and dangerously immune to carbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret made a swift U-turn in my gut, and I took atiny step back, already rethinking everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he gestured for me to wait. He was on the phone, looking very much like a man who closed deals before breakfast. He held up a hand,mouthed &#34;one second,&#34; then pointed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped into his flat, trying not to look too nosy while absolutely snooping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about the same size and layout as mine, but the vibe was all different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where mine screamed &#34;early-twenties chaos with a side of IKEA regrets,&#34; his felt sleek. Understated.Expensive in that annoying way where you knew each item had a brand name that required a six-month waitlist and a blood oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it didn&#39;t feel lived-in. No clutter, no mess, no personality. More hotel suite than home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either he&#39;d just moved in like I suspected, or he barely slept here. Which, fair enough. He didn&#39;t look like the type who needed more than four hours of sleep or any kind of throw cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could finish my impromptu Cribs tour, he ended the call and turned to me, eyebrow raised in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. Time to stop gawping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out the cheque I&#39;d written and held it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the shirt,&#34; I said. &#34;The one I sort of shredded during our, uh, you know... last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the cheque. &#34;I don&#39;t need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I do. Need to give it, I mean.&#34; I set it on his glass coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reply. And I suddenly had absolutely no idea what to do with my limbs. My arms were weird. My legs were traitors. The silence swelled between us like a balloon full of awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a step. Barely even that. But it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the real reason you came?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. Every muscle in my body tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being this close, I was forcibly reminded of just how tall he was-and how much he radiated that very specific, very male sort of danger. That raw, unfiltered,primal energy that made my instincts twitch like I was standing in front of something wild and untamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t doing anything. Just leaning in, breathing the same air. But my pulse was suddenly doing parkour in my neck and my mouth was dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t fear, not exactly. It was that same instinctual thrill you&#39;d get if you were face to face with a leopard in the wild-well-fed, maybe, but still looking at you like it hadn&#39;t ruled out dessert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if there was glass between you and the claws,your body still clocked that you were in the presence of a predator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My palms were sweating. My knees had opinions about gravity. My fight-or-flight response was going through a full-blown crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All because this man, this maybe-dangerous, possibly -rich, definitely-hot neighbour was looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here I was about to pitch the world&#39;s most deranged idea: fake marriage. Casual pretend engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just your everyday &#34;hey, can you be my incredibly powerful and slightly terrifying fiancé so my parents will stop trying to marry me off to the highest.bidder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah. No way this was going to come across as anything but completely unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To stall, I said, &#34;You mentioned a proposal that time..back at the hotel? I didn&#39;t really catch the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow. &#34;That&#39;s funny. Because | seem to remember I&#39;m the one asking the questions right now,and you still haven&#39;t answered me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. That.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened, and before | could stop myself, the words just... spilled out. &#34;I want to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a beat of silence. Then he blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean-not really marry you,&#34; I added in a rush, the dam well and truly broken now. &#34;I mean yes,technically, but not romantically. It&#39;s fake. A cover. A bluff. A strategic performance. My parents-okay, my mum-has basically gone full villain mode and is trying to auction me off to some obscenely wealthy fifty-year-old who owns, like, half the shipping industry and is on the hunt for Wife Number Five, and if I don&#39;t show up with someone even richer and more terrifying,she&#39;s going to force me into some grotesque merger of souls and assets. I&#39;ve got three days to conjure up a billionaire fiancé with serious scary-man energy,and the list of available candidates is currently: you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally paused to breathe, chest heaving like I&#39;d just finished a sprint, which, emotionally speaking, I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything. Didn&#39;t laugh. Didn&#39;t call building security. Just studied me for a second like. I was a crossword puzzle that had started solving itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him. &#34;Sorry-what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; he repeated, like this sort of thing happened to him all the time. &#34;I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared. My brain short-circuited so hard I half expected to smell burnt toast. &#34;Just like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;My family&#39;s been on my back about finding a wife. I&#39;m not interested in dating. Your proposal happens to solve my problem too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on, &#34;In fact, that was what I was trying to bring up back at the hotel, before you left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-this feels... surreal,&#34; I said, blinking at him like he&#39;d grown another head. &#34;I mean, me needing a fake fiancé at the exact same time you&#39;re in the market for a fake fiancée? What are the odds-? Wait, just to be clear,&#34; I added hastily, &#34;it is a fake fiancée you are looking for, right? Not a real one, I mean.&#34;</p>
