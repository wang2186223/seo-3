                <p>I slapped Ashton&#39;s hand before he could reach his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, no. Let the cops handle it. You&#39;ve already gone full Godfather once tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t saying I didn&#39;t want Rhys to suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just wasn&#39;t willing to risk Ashton catching a charge for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they dragged him off, Rhys already looked half -dead-blood all over his mouth, shirt soaked like something out of a bad crime doc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys isn&#39;t worth going to prison for,&#34; I told Ashton, in case he misunderstood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled heavily. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll leave the police to handle it. How&#39;s your wrist?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rotated my wrist and winced. Damn Rhys and his gym strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything, but Ashton saw the sweat beading at my temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. Hospital. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grumbled, &#34;It&#39;s not that bad. I&#39;ll live. It&#39;s late. Too much trouble to go to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drive.&#34; His voice left zero room for debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still didn&#39;t move, and he added, &#34;What, are you waiting for me to carry you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprang up like my arse was on fire. &#34;Nope. I&#39;ve got legs. Watch me use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked ahead, paused like he was considering taking my hand, then didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, he slid behind the wheel and drove us to a private hospital just minutes away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I figured he probably played poker with the owner or something, because the second we pulled up,there were nurses and a doctor already waiting outside,clearly expecting us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The X-ray showed no broken bones, just a nasty soft tissue injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation: it hurt like hell, but I wouldn&#39;t be needing a titanium wrist anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the doctor dabbed a minty-smelling ointment onto my wrist, Ashton stood behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t see his face, but judging by the way the doctor was sweating through his white lab coat like the air con didn&#39;t exist, Ashton was probably looking murdery again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and started walking away.&#34;Excuse me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Are you calling your assistant?&#34; I craned my neck to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused at the doorway. &#34;Why do you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re calling to arrange for Rhys to... you know.&#34;I glanced at the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me not to do it?&#34; His voice hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m telling you... be discreet. Make sure you don&#39;t get caught.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might have smiled. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor finished, we didn&#39;t hang around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a quick wrap-up and we were back in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the tension rolling off Ashton like heat from a busted radiator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few blocks, he snapped out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glanced over at me like he&#39;d only just remembered l was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys isn&#39;t going to let this go,&#34; he said. &#34;He&#39;s not going to handle your marriage that well. You can&#39;t stay at Oakwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stifled a yawn. &#34;What? He&#39;s not a serial killer. He got arrested. He&#39;ll back off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.&#34;You read the news? People kill their exes all the time these days. What if he&#39;s got some undiagnosed psycho streak? You wait until he sets your flat on fire or slashes your tires, and then what?&#34; I shivered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The images of Rhys slapping me in his penthouse over Catherine&#39;s mug, of him dragging me down the hallway earlier tonight, slammed right back into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Ashton had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just... I literally just moved in. Paid three months upfront, can&#39;t get my deposit back. And finding another place is going to be a total nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stopped at a red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton turned to me, face smooth, voice dipped in just enough honey to raise suspicions. &#34;You could move in with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked. &#34;Move in with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure if he was kidding or just temporarily out of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a contract marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No feelings, no funny business, and definitely no playing house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan was to stay out of each other&#39;s way until the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s... probably not a great idea,&#34; | said slowly,trying to tell him it was a stupid idea without using those actual words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught the look I shot him and let out a dry laugh &#34;Relax. I&#39;m not trying anything. It&#39;s just safer. And I&#39;m not exactly emotionally invested in this relationship so there&#39;s zero chance I&#39;ll suddenly fall for you or anything like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly, the more indifferent he sounded, the more reassured I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man too cold to flirt was a man who wouldn&#39;t try to get into my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, wasn&#39;t he still saving himself for his precious lost love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living with him might just be glorified flat-sharing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still hesitating when he added, &#34;Besides,living together helps with my situation. With my grandfather,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. How&#39;s he doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to the road. &#34;Much better. I showed him the marriage certificate. Worked like magic.He actually got out of bed that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad to hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told him you wanted to meet him. Grandpa said yes.He&#39;s feeling so much better now, he even wants to check out of the sanatorium and come home. If he sees me living there alone, wifeless...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, I get it. Alright, I&#39;ll move in.&#34; Then I added, only half-joking, &#34;Hope you don&#39;t snore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. I&#39;m slammed at work this week. There&#39;s a project deadline I can&#39;t miss. I&#39;ll move in after that,once the dust settles, cool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we pulled up outside Oakwood Apartments, he spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandfather&#39;s turning eighty soon. There&#39;s going to be a big party. The entire Laurent family has to be there. You&#39;ll come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Sure. I&#39;ll go with you. They know I&#39;m your,um,wife,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; He glanced at me, smirking. &#34;But I didn&#39;t tell them about our... arrangement. As far as they know,we&#39;re madly in love. Might have to act the part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. I can act.&#34;</p>
