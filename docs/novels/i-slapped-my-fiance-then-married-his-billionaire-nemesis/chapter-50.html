                <p>I was half-dead on the couch, scrolling through dog videos for inspiration, when someone started pounding on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t ordered food. Yvaine wasn&#39;t coming tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And you needed a building pass just to get on my floor,so that left...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing,I opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep.Rhys Granger,Looking like someone had pissed in his Cristal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; I said immediately and went to slam it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved a foot in. &#34;You dodging me now? I&#39;ve got something to say!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it. Then leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you married that guy just to spite me, you win. Fine.You win. I&#39;m here now. You got what you wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;You think I got married to piss you off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you?&#34; he said, jaw tight. &#34;You&#39;ve been into me since we were kids. You don&#39;t just flip a switch and stop. Everything you&#39;re doing right now is just a game.&#34;Oh, for fuck&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms. &#34;Rhys, the day you let my darling sister crawl into your lap at that bar was the day l stopped liking you. Yeah, I used to be an idiot. But I&#39;m not anymore. So let me make this crystal clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I. Am. Married. I have a husband. A real one. Not a maybe-one-day-if-you-behave placeholder. You and I? We&#39;re nothing. I don&#39;t love you. I don&#39;t even like you now. Got it? Is that enough closure for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys just stood there, shoulders slumped, mouth half -open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good. Let it sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing went weird, like someone had stuffed a sock down his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No way. You can&#39;t not love me.&#34; He sounded like a broken chatbot. &#34;You marrying Ashton Laurent?That was the real joke. You think the heir to the Laurent empire&#39;s actually gonna fall for you? Maybe he played along for now &#39;cause you blackmailed him or whatever, but once he comes to his senses,you won&#39;t even know what hit you before you&#39;re out on your arse-or dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at the ceiling, praying for patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the hell did I never notice how exhausting it was just talking to Rhys?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d said what I needed to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t wasting another breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not come back here,&#34; I said, then turned and slammed the door-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I tried to slam it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except his foot was still in the gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a solid &#34;crunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Followed by the kind of scream that probably made my neighbors reach for their phones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AAAAAHH!! My foot!! Mirabelle, are you trying to murder me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His polished leather shoe had a dent, but I didn&#39;t see blood or bone fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move it,&#34; I said coolly. &#34;Or next time I&#39;ll snap the whole damn thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Rhys gritted his teeth and clung to the doorframe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my wrist hard and yanked me out into the hallway. &#34;You think you can just shut the door on me?I&#39;m not done talking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; I twisted, tried to pull free, but his grip was vice-tight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel it pressing straight into the bone. &#34;Rhys!You&#39;re hurting me, you lunatic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reply. It was like he&#39;d gone full zombie mode and couldn&#39;t hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse-he started dragging me towards the lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming home with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hell I am! Let go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was debating if kneeing him in the groin was worth a trip to the police station when the lift let out a cheerful &#34;ding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton strode out, stopped short at the sight of us,then picked up his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right in front of me in a matter of seconds and landed a punch straight into Rhys&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys made a choked-up sound, somewhere between a yelp and a dying pigeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ashton grabbed his shirt collar with one hand and clamped down on Rhys&#39;s wrist with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yanked him clean off me like peeling off a cheap sticker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the fuck are you?!&#34; Rhys gasped, hunched over like a kicked bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked dazed, probably couldn&#39;t see past the cartoon stars circling his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s voice came down like a guillotine: &#34;Lay a hand on her again, and I&#39;ll kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried squinting up at the newcomer&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the moment he recognized Ashton, because he flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I couldn&#39;t blame him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even I was a little scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had delivered his threat in a perfectly calm voice, and something told me he&#39;d have no trouble carrying it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys, for all his puffed-up ego, couldn&#39;t even stand straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicking, he backed away a step and shouted, as if volume could make up for his lack of courage,&#34;Mirabelle is my fiancée! What I do with her is none of your business!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last part came out about three decibels softer than the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Rhys himself didn&#39;t believe it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys scrambled back farther.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton parked himself right in front of me like a six-foot human wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle is my wife. You show up at my place in the middle of the night harassing her, and you think that&#39;s got nothing to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys swallowed. Loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear it from behind Ashton&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when he straightened up and tried to match Ashton&#39;s height, he still had to tip his chin up just to make eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t marry her willingly, right? If she&#39;s got  something on you-pictures, whatever-l can help. She blackmailed you, didn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Willow Granger really had him out here reading off a script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d convinced themselves I&#39;d somehow blackmailed Ashton into marrying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did they think I had on him? Dick pics? The nuclear launch codes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I poked my head out from behind Ashton. &#34;You are delusional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently,Ashton nudged me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second,his fist connected with Rhys&#39;s other cheek.Dead center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now his face was finally symmetrical. Swollen on both sides like a rotten melon.</p>
