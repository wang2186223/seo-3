                <p>I woke up with my face pressed against something warm and solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a second to realize it was skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Male skin. Tanned, smooth, slightly salty. Rising and falling in a steady, hypnotic rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers were digging into someone&#39;s abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not soft ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was dim-early gray morning kind of dim-but not so dim that I missed the fact that I was clinging to Ashton like a koala, and he was bare-chested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked hard. Stayed still for one moment, then another, waiting for my sluggish brain to boot up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was a blur. I remembered the fever, the IV drip, the ice packs. Ashton getting into bed with me.Then leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond that? Blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hospital gown was still on, but thin enough that | could feel the heat radiating off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my hand-God-was still resting on his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked it back, Stopped halfway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peeked at his face. His eyes were closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, sneakily, like a thief, I laid my hand back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel of him was ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d taken boxing classes, tried to build up some muscle, managed a flat stomach on a good day-but never a six-pack. Let alone an eight-pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had eight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A perfect eight-pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So defined it looked carved. Clinical, almost. Like it should be in an anatomy textbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my fingertips lightly over the ridges, tracing the grooves between them. Noting the difference in muscle distribution, not just the surface tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys had abs, too, the result of his dedicated gym routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have a bodybuilder&#39;s vocabulary to name the difference. I just knew Ashton&#39;s muscles weren&#39;t limited to his midsection. His chest was just as firmn, and judging by how his thigh felt under mine, the rest of him matched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s abs were probably the only solid part of him. His hands were smooth and soft. His skin, pampered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Ashton again. Still out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emboldened, I pressed my palm flat against his stomach. Felt the rise and fall of his breath. The tension stayed, even in sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouldn&#39;t muscles relax in sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt...ready. Like he could go from deep sleep to ready-for-battle in a blink. Like a jaguar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand jerked back.&#34;M-morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly became very aware that my thigh was still hooked over his. I shifted to roll away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that&#39;s when I felt the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The big, unmistakable problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat. &#34;Did you...stay with me all night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t remember?&#34; His voice rumbled overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something different about him. A lightness in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in a good mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was kind of out of it. Probably delirious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He touched my forehead, then drew back. &#34;Fever&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.I feel better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced down at me. &#34;Then why&#39;s your face still red?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze mid-leg-unhook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get the doctor,&#34; he said, laughter in his voice as he gently untangled our limbs, got out of bed, grabbed a shirt from the laundry bag on the rack, and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up. My body felt heavy, but no longer feverish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I patted my cheeks. Still hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Padding into the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and leaned over the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And saw the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two very obvious points were poking at the thin fabric of the gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must&#39;ve seen. No way he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it,&#34; I muttered again andrushed back to bed, yanking the blanket up to my chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor came in, checked my vitals, and told me I needed to stay a few days for observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had breakfast brought up while I was still fiddling with the blanket. He raised the tray table and started setting up as if it was Sunday brunch at a boutique hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would&#39;ve insisted on eating at the coffee table like a normal human with four working limbs, but I kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way was 1 letting the girls be noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever delivered the breakfast must&#39;ve thought Ashton was catering for a football team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toast. Pastries. Scrambled eggs. Fresh fruit. Fourmini jars of jam. Butter. Coffee. Juice. A tall bottle of water that didn&#39;t even fit on the tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he cleared the side table and added cheese. Cold cuts. Smoked salmon. Plain yogurt in a glass jar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a whale, you know,&#34; I said, squinting at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor said you might not have much of an appetite. So I asked for variety. Just eat what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Join me,&#34; I invited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and started to sit on the edge of the bed, then paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; He pulled up a chair instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up a spoon and got to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he&#39;d unscrewed the jam lid, I&#39;d already demolished a cup of yogurt and half a sliceof French toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched me for a full minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; | asked, self-conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You eat fast,&#34; he said calmly, like an observation in a chart. &#34;And you swallow fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proof that my appetite&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eating too fast isn&#39;t good for digestion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered, &#34;Right. Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried slowing down. Lasted maybe three bites before I gave up and let my mouth do its thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t mention it again. Just looked at me like he was filing it away for later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more food I had in my stomach, the more of last night came back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered talking. Saying too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuff I&#39;d only ever told Yvaine. Things I&#39;d buried years ago. Things I didn&#39;t want Ashton-or anyone-to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trusted him; he&#39;d been the ideal fake husband. A perfect partner in crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I hadn&#39;t meant to show him the broken bits of the high school version of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hoped he&#39;d forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isobel Brooke&#39;s been arrested,&#34; he said.</p>
