                <p>I didn&#39;t even glance at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just kept shoveling spicy chicken over rice into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna dropped herself into the seat opposite mine and dumped her shopping bags on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed. &#34;Not going to talk? Last time we saw each other, you slapped me and ripped out a chunk of my hair. It still hasn&#39;t grown back, by the way.You&#39;ve got some nerve not showing up to apologize.Now you&#39;re blanking me like I don&#39;t exist. Ever heard of basic manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Manners? You&#39;re the one who sat down without an invitation, is currently spraying spit all over my jerk chicken, and taking up a seat that an actual paying customer might want. So unless you&#39;re planning to order something, eat it, and shut up, I suggest you find the nearest exit and flounce right back out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth opened, then closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She choked on her own comeback for a second,probably trying to decide if she should scream or sulk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her face lit up with petty delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just figured you might want some company,&#34; she said, her voice syrupy with fake sympathy. &#34;I heard the Grangers pulled back all their wedding invites.After you chased Rhys around like a loyal golden retriever for years, he&#39;s finally tossed you. Poor Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked her tongue. &#34;What now? Aunt Caroline said you&#39;re even cutting ties with your family.So if no man wants you and your family&#39;s out, what are you going to do-live under a bridge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a cold smile. &#34;Wow. Everything out of your mouth starts and ends with men. Can&#39;t survive without a dick in your orbit? I&#39;m actually curious to see what kind of Prince Charming ends up stuck with you. You had a crush on Rhys, didn&#39;t you? Well,now&#39;s your chance. Just a heads-up though,Catherine is in the picture now. You&#39;ll have to fight her for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I so don&#39;t like him anymore,&#34; she denied. &#34;He&#39;s a total player. I&#39;d never go for someone like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me, hunting for cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably expected me to be moping, mascara running, wailing about lost love and betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all she got was the top of my head and the sound of my fork scraping the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped her fingers.&#34;Oi, are you deaf? Don&#39;t care about Rhys anymore? Fine. But I bet you&#39;ll care about what I&#39;m about to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet | won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it&#39;s big. Like, life-altering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my mouth. &#34;Still don&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nostrils flared. &#34;God, you&#39;re such a cow. Fine, I&#39;ll tell you anyway-Isobel Brooke&#39;s back in town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand stalled an inch from my iced coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression didn&#39;t change-much-but the twitch in my brow must&#39;ve betrayed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She latched onto that flicker like a parasite finding blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! I knew it. You&#39;re not so unbothered after all. You should be scared. Remember what happened? Her family shipped her off because of you. Word is, she&#39;s had it rough out there. You think she forgot? You think you&#39;re not at the top of her revenge list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grin stretched like she thought she&#39;d won something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the only thing she&#39;d ever win was Most Likely to Be Slapped at a Wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sipped my coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bit too much ice, not enough espresso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Serenna wasn&#39;t warning me out of the kindness of her cold, botoxed heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wanted to see if I&#39;d flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>See if the big, bad Mira Vance still had old ghosts rattling around in her closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And okay. If we&#39;re dragging skeletons out, let&#39;s talk about Isobel bloody Brooke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in school, if there was one person who could make me sweat, it wasn&#39;t a teacher, or a parent, or even my high-maintenance sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Queen Bitch of Westbridge Prep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mean girl royalty, with just enough money and power to ruin someone&#39;s life before breakfast and still make it to third period looking fresh as fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I kept my head down with textbooks and sketchbooks, she held court from the back row,doing her makeup and filming TikToks for her adoring fans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stayed out of each other&#39;s orbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she made me her target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All because the guy she liked had a crush on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that l ever flirted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But girls like her didn&#39;t need a reason, just a target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, I didn&#39;t even know the guy&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t know the real reason until later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until I beat it out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Isobel, the idea that someone might choose me over her wasn&#39;t just unthinkable-it was blasphemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had to be punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>l ignored the passive-aggressive digs and the giggles behind my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every school had that, and I had better things to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my not reacting only fueled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d graduated beyond harmless locker room pranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom lock-ins and water dumps didn&#39;t get the reaction she wanted, so she went full sociopath-she spiked my drink at the school dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone swapped my soda for vodka-laced with something else-and before I knew it, I was stumbling like a half-sedated raccoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dizzy. Blurred. Disoriented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Led out of the dance hall and straight into a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Into a building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To some scumbag who&#39;d been circling me for months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they didn&#39;t plan on was me coming back swinging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smashed his nose with a jagged piece of rebar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Might have also broken a couple of ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I escaped, called the cops, filed the report, did everything right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then my parents dropped the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turns out, the Brooke family had connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They threw hush money at my parents, painted it as a &#34;teenage misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Vances took the payout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t even consulted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a signature away from justice, and they folded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I handled it myself.</p>
