                <p>After work, I crashed Yvaine&#39;s shoot. She was wrapping up a final round of photos for some artsy indie boutique no one&#39;s heard of but everyone pretends to love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally changed out of a chainmail minidress and stilettos, we hit one of her regular haunts-this little boutique in West 7th called Spitfire. She&#39;d sweet-talked the owner into holding a dress she claimed had my name stitched into its soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at the dress, and I stopped breathing. Crimson satin. Plunging neckline. A thigh-high slit that could probably cause traffic accidents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gawked. &#34;You&#39;re kidding. I can&#39;t wear that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just... not my usual style.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the point, honey. You&#39;ve got one shot to stun a crowd and make a man spiral,&#34; Yvaine said, hands on her hips. &#34;This is it. You&#39;re not showing up as yourself tomorrow. You&#39;re showing up as the woman every other woman wants to be, and every man regrets losing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bit dramatic,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bit iconic,&#34; she snapped. &#34;Now shut up and try it on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the sales girl chimed in, &#34;If I had your waist and that ex, I&#39;d show up dressed like vengeance too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bought the damn dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at my new flat-tiny, sunlit, and finally mine-l hung up the dress in the closet and flopped onto the sofa.The moving crew had dropped everything off earlier. Rhys didn&#39;t know this address. My parents didn&#39;t either.Clean slate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way home, I&#39;d dropped by the hospital. Louisa was out of surgery, recovering, still closed off to visitors. I didn&#39;t push. I didn&#39;t want her guilt-tripping me into forgiving her son and left before Rhys showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I stood in front of my miror, holding up earrings against my neck. I had no clue if Ashton&#39;s family preferred pearls or diamonds, saints or sinners. Tomorrow&#39;s party wasn&#39;t just about dress codes and canapétrays. it was his grand announcement: Meet my fake fiancée. All I had to do was nod and smile and play nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should&#39;ve asked him what they were like. Cold? Conservative? Open to women who&#39;ve made at least two of their leering male colleagues cry in public?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hadn&#39;t told me. He was off somewhere &#34;on business,&#34; which, let&#39;s be honest, could mean anything from mergers to murder. I didn&#39;t even know the name of his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stove clicked off behind me, and I was just about to sit down when the doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every cell in my body jolted. No one knew I&#39;d moved except Yvaine. I crept to the peephole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, I opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stood there.Hoodie. Joggers. Sharp-eyed and aggravatingly handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just got back from the trip. Thought I&#39;d drop by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain glitched. For a second, I thought I&#39;d hallucinated myself back into my old apartment, the one where he lived across the hall and could pop by at any moment. But nope. I turned and stared at the stack of unopened moving boxes behind me. This was my new place. My clean slate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How the hell did you find me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Made a few calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course he did. Same man who&#39;d tracked Louisa&#39;s hospital room faster than I could Google &#39;where&#39;s the nearest ER centre&#39;. I hated how fast he moved, how smug he looked while doing it. I hated that I was also...impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should&#39;ve felt violated, probably. Most people take weeks to get a couch delivered-he tracked my new address in less time than it takes to boil pasta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t radiate creep energy. Just power. Cold, inconvenient,casually terrifying power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you come straight from the airport? You look-&#34;|trailed off, noticing the lack of a suitcase. His joggers were tailored, his T-shirt suspiciously wrinkle-free. Not travel clothes. Not jet-lagged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.° He gave me that infuriatingly calm stare. &#34;I bought the flat across the hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. So that was the plan. We were neighbors agáln. Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he added, deadpan, &#34;If we&#39;re going to be engaged-and maybe, soon, married-I thought proximity would help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw twitched. So he&#39;d gone from fáke flancé to fake husband in under ten seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything. Couldn&#39;t. My brain was buffering, trying to download a reaction from the chaos cloud in my chest. I wasn&#39;t ready to commit to another lie when I was still unpacking from the last one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t push. Just shrugged. &#34;It&#39;ll be easier if we&#39;re seen coming and going together. My family likes to pry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course they do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. Mostly because saying &#39;what the actual hell&#39; felt rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched. Not awkward yet, but almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You eaten?&#34; | blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched an eyebrow, like he wasn&#39;t sure if that was an offer or a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I said, already regretting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the place still smelled like fresh paint and furniture polish. I reheated my sad little dinner-leftover pasta, garlic bread that had gone soggy in the fridge, and a salad that barely passed for edible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t flinch. Just sat at my cramped table like it was the Ritz and accepted the meal like it was a tasting menu. Didn&#39;t even comment on the stainless-steel cutlery, which honestly felt like handing royalty a spork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ate like he&#39;d gone to finishing school with Bond villains. Knife in his right hand, posture too perfect for someone in loungewear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to fill the silence. &#34;So... what exactly do you do, Ashton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut a piece of garlic bread with surgical precision. &#34;Business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s specific.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t chatty. But he wasn&#39;t a wall either. Every time I asked him something, Ashton answered-short, to the point, polite. But he never asked anything back. No follow-ups, no elaboration. Just clean, efficient replies like a human email.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed a glance at the TV, trying to fish for common ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ever watch The Spite Club?&#34; I nodded at the screen, where two reality stars were waterboarding each other with kombucha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression didn&#39;t even twitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fair enough. That show was garbage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the financial news came on-stocks, suits, the usual late-capitalist meltdown-and that got a flicker out of him. Not much, just a look. But it landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finance guy, then. Banker or shark. Probably both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through dinner, my phone buzzed. Unknown number. I ignored it. Probably another telemarketer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a text popped up:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[You should really reconsider pretending to be my fiancée. Just until my mum gets better. Agree to play along, and I&#39;ll forgive you for the assault at the hospital.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted. Only one man could turn manipulation into charity and still sound smug doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blocked Rhys&#39;s new number and deleted the text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have made a face because Ashton looked up and asked, &#34;Rhys Granger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and shrugged. &#34;Still trying to cast me in his personal soap opera.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say a word. I figured that was the end of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stood up, disappeared down the hallway, and came back with two suit bags. Designer labels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obnoxiously expensive. Clearly men&#39;s clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;|asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＂Stage dressing，＂ he said. ＂If you＇re not ready to escalate the fake engagement into a fake marriage， we＇月need something else to make it believable. Like living together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s overkfll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I could find your new address, so can he.&#34; His voice was flat. &#34;Couple grand to a Pl. Or two phone calls,tops.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Rhys shows up, ITl handle him,&#34;I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No doubt. But a few suits in the closet might make him hesitate. Make him believe the lie before he tries to rewrite it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>raised an eyebrow. &#34;Or I could just show up to his place, shove my tongue down your throat, and finally nake him believe I&#39;m with someone else now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>winced.&#34;Sorry. That was-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a bad idea,&#34; he said, voice unreadable. &#34;If he shows up and you need to sell the act, call me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>barked out a nervous laugh and scooped up the suits. &#34;Let&#39;s call that Plan B, shall we? I&#39;ll, um... P&#39;ll hang these up.&#34;</p>
