                <p>&#34;Arrested?&#34; The juice in my mouth suddenly tasted sweeter. &#34;For what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aggravated assault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my own nose.&#34;But I wasn&#39;t assaulted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She pushed you into a pool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34;|admitted. &#34;But I&#39;m fine now. NNo &#39;serious bodily injury.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not for lack of trying on her part,&#34; Ashton said, his voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet her family&#39;s already posted bail.&#34; The Brookes had more than enough money for that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m thrilled she&#39;s finally been arrested, but it&#39;s just my word against hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s evidence. Someone filmed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I perked up. &#34;Really? Who? I need to send them flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved. &#34;I already took care of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; I took another long sip of juice, savoring it.&#34;She used to mess with me in school. Barely back in town and already pulling the same crap. I&#39;m not letting it slide this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton asked, &#34;What did she do to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I already tell you? In the car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bits and pieces. You were mostly incoherent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sipped the juice, set it down, tasted the coffee, then abandoned that too. Picked up the buttered toast and chewed in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and lowered the toast. He already knew half of it. Might as well give him the rest. Sort of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a trimmed-down version. Just the surface. Skipped the worst parts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spilling everything while feverish and half-dead was one thing. Doing it stone-cold sober with full brain function was harder. Even with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ashton noticed my dodge, he didn&#39;t call me out on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to do?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; want to sue her. Properly. If the prosecutor drops the criminal charges&#34;-I rolled my eyes-&#34;because the Brookes will be working overtime pulling strings like last time, then I&#39;m bringing a civil suit. And not just for this. For everything back in high school too. The police kept records. Finn, my lawyer, said he can get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve thought this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an idea l&#39;d been toying with ever since Serenna told me Isobel was back in town. Isobel Brooke was a rot l intended to cut out for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got the entire LGH legal department at your disposal,&#34; Ashton said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He beat me to it. &#34;They&#39;re already working with your lawyer on the libel suit. May as well keep the teamwork going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, then nodded. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look thrilled. &#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me. You&#39;re my wife. My lawyers are your lawyers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I joked, &#34;Tell that to couples in the middle of a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t crack a smile. Didn&#39;t so much as twitch a corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I winced and took refuge in my coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he said, &#34;You&#39;ve got me. If you ever need anything, you come to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 nodded.&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up. His voice had gone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were gearing up to sue Rhys on your own. Planning to handle Isobel by yourself. When there was trouble at work, you dealt with it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was quiet heat behind his words. Accusation,tightly leashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you-&#34; I broke off. &#34;Of course you knew. Hence that dinner with Octavia Grey. Who told you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored the question. &#34;You ever need anything, you come to me.&#34; This time, it was a command, not a suggestion. &#34;As long as you&#39;re Mrs. Laurent, anything that touches you, touches me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye aye, Captain.&#34; His tone was so dead serious I nearly stood and saluted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through breakfast, his phone went off. Twice. Long calls. One of them in French. I nibbled a croissant and watched the butter melt into a golden pool on the porcelain plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he came back in, I said, &#34;You don&#39;t have to babysit me. I&#39;m not dying. Or ninety. If you&#39;re that worried,get me a nurse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;I&#39;ll work from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could&#39;ve argued, but I knew a lost cause when I saw one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Director&#39;s Wing was more suite than hospital roomn. It had a private lounge, a kitchen, and a dining nook.More than enough space to live in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had Dominic bring up everything-laptops, files, chargers, two phones, and something that looked suspiciously like a compact espresso machine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set up shop in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay in bed, bored out of my skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an hour, I scrolled through short videos until they all blurred into one long, idiotic loop. My thumb ached,my eyes went dry. I dropped the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a few laundry bags on a rack near the bed. Some held his things, some mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out a set of clothes, including underwear, silently praying it was Carmen the female housekeeper who packed them and not Geoffrey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bathroom, I slipped on a tank top and shorts underneath so I wouldn&#39;t flash anyone through the gown&#39;s rear slit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton was on a video call in the lounge, sharp French coming fast, face drawn tight as he frowned at charts on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped out while he was mid-sentence, hospital slippers noiseless on the carpeted floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wandered the corridor like a bored inmate out on parole. Most of the doors were closed. There was no one else except an occasional passing nurse who gave me a friendly nod but didn&#39;t stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking out the window, I decided to venture downstairs. I figured a place like this had to have a garden somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two floors down, I stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had caught my eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or rather, someone.</p>
