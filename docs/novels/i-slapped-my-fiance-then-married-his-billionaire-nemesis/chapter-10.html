                <p>&#34;Shut it, Rhys,&#34; I snapped. &#34;You know damn well why I broke things off. So do us all a favor and back off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed the death grip I had on the wine bottle and caught the look in my eyes-the same look that said l wouldn&#39;t think twice about smashing it over his infuriating head again, just like last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys froze. The look on his face was absolutely priceless. It was like I&#39;d just walked up and slapped him with a frozen salmon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply couldn&#39;t process the fact that I was no longer the starry-eyed doormat who used to treat his words like gospel. Hewas probably still reeling from the time I&#39;d literally slapped him during our breakup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t think his ego had recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rhys could open his mouth again, a manager in a suit so sharp it could&#39;ve sliced air walked over. He looked at Rhys and Catherine as if they were yesterday&#39;s expired prawns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re now on our banned list.You&#39;re no longer welcome here. Ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys spluttered like a clogged kettle.&#34;W-what? You can&#39;t be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of explaining, the manager waved over security. Two very large men in very small earpieces started making their way toward our table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys kept yelling something about how he&#39;d &#34;file a complaint&#34; or whatever nonsense billionaires shout when things don&#39;t go their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine just hissed something under her breath and followed him out, her heels clicking likeangry punctuation marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the chaos walked itself out, the manager turned to me with a faint, polite smile. &#34;Apologies for the disturbance, miss. Your dinner tonight is on the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him. &#34;That&#39;s... very generous of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pleasure,&#34; he said smoothly. &#34;You&#39;re a highly valued patron here at La Vache Dorée.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Highly valued.&#34; Right. I&#39;d been here maybe twice this past month, and both times I&#39;d ordered the cheapest set menu and split a dessert with Yvaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I eyed the manager, whom I&#39;d vaguely recognized from those visits-always polite, always professional,but never this... chummy. He gave off big energy of someone who wouldn&#39;t notice me in a line-up unless I&#39;d set the restaurant on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could question his sudden generosity, he handed me a black card embossed with the restaurant&#39;s logo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The owner asked me to pass this along. You&#39;re welcome to dine here anytime. No charge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a little bow and disappeared into the kitchen before | could even sputter a refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine gawked at the card. &#34;Wait, what? Mira, do you know the owner of this place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I had a hunch who it might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got back to my flat, still riding the high from watching Rhys and Catherine get chucked out of the restaurant like a couple of misbehaving toddlers, the universe decided I&#39;d had enough fun for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Landlord was waiting by my door, fiddling with his keys like they were rosary beads. Mr. Donnelly, mid-fifties,who always smelled faintly of microwaveable shepherd&#39;s pie and wore socks with sandals, gave me a look like I&#39;d just run over his cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Vance, I&#39;m really sorry,&#34; he said, scratching his head in that way men do when they&#39;re about to say something completely awful but want to look sympathetic while doing it. &#34;There&#39;s going to be some,ah,urgent renovations. Safety stuff. You&#39;ll need to, ah,vacate the apartment by the end of the week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. And I was the Queen of England.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could practically hear my mother&#39;s voice behind his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guess she&#39;d made good on that charming threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll be gone in two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No arguments. No begging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave an awkward nod and shuffled off, probably to microwave another shepherd&#39;s pie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d expected this. Just didn&#39;t expect my mother to move this fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving wasn&#39;t an issue. I could afford somewhere better. Bigger. With windows that didn&#39;t jam and a kitchen that didn&#39;t double as a sauna every time l boiled water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, I could&#39;ve offered Mr. Donnelly double the rent and he&#39;d probably have wept with joy and accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that would&#39;ve been like duct-taping a crack in the Hoover Dam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if I stayed, my mum knew where I lived. The calls,the visits, the threats disguised as motherly concern-none of it would stop unless I gave in and married Leonard Shaw or whatever crusty aristocrat she dug up,or found a man powerful enough to scare her into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of which...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was halfway through mentally packing my jewellery tools and wondering if my next landlord would let me solder in the living room when it hit me-l&#39;d agreed to fake an engagement with my very attractive neighbor,and I didn&#39;t even know his bloody name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brilliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my defense, I&#39;d been a little preoccupied during that meeting,mostly with the way his shirt hugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And also with the very inconvenient, very vivid flashbacks to that night in the hotel room. The one with all the foggy bits and the completely uncalled-for heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when he started going on about the details of our arrangement, I was too busy staring at his mouth and wondering if it still tasted the same to take in much of anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still. Minor detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scribbled a note!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hey, just a heads-up-I&#39;m moving out in two days.Long story. Here&#39;s my number in case you still want to go ahead with the whole fake fiancé thing. Name&#39;s Mira,by the way. Cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tucked it under his door across the hall. The lights were off, no sound from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was probably out doing hot, mysterious things.Like brooding on a rooftop or teaching orphans how to box or whatever handsome men do when they&#39;re not accidentally getting roped into fake relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I went back to my flat, plonked myself on the sofa, opened my laptop, and typed &#34;apartments that won&#39;t ruin your life&#34; into the search bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys rang just as I was elbow-deep in a bag of cheesy crisps, trying to ignore my tragic life by watching an aggressively cheerful baking show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered because | was in a good mood and didn&#39;t bother to check caller ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid of me,really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother with small talk. &#34;Dinner. Tomorrow night. With my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back on the sofa and stared at the ceiling like it owed me an explanation. &#34;Rhys, we&#39;re not together anymore. In case your memory&#39;s as selective as your morals.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffed. &#34;My mother wants to see you.&#34;</p>
