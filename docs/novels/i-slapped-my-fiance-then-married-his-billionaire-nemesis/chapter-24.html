                <p>Yvaine suddenly found the floor fascinating. Her heels. A smudge on the carpet. Anything but my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yvaine,&#34; I said, sharper this time. &#34;You know all the gossip in town. Spill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She winced. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to tell you. Thought it might... I don&#39;t know. Upset you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me,&#34; I said. &#34;The only thing that could upset me right now is running out of alcohol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine gave a guilty little shrug. &#34;Fine. Yeah. They&#39;re working together. Catherine&#39;s his secretary now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I thought I hadn&#39;t heard her right. &#34;Secretary? Like... scheduling and stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barked out a laugh, way too loud for a party this fancy. A few people glanced over. I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Rhys and I were a thing, I needed to book an appointment just to swing by his office with a sandwich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Catherine, whose only organizational skill was getting thrown out of a club in under ten minutes, got an all-access pass?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course she is,&#34; I said, grabbing another drink off the tray of a passing waiter. bloody course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine quickly changed the subject. &#34;Why don&#39;t we go say hi to the Van Astors? Their son runs a boutique fashion label. Might be a chance for you to collab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and followed her across the room. Business before drama. Always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But apparently, Catherine didn&#39;t share that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just sealed a handshake deal with Whitman Van Astor to look at my new designs-my jewelry line might even end up in his next spring launch-when she came back, dragging Serenna Oakley behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d clocked Serenna the second she slithered in. Looked like Catherine had pulled some strings to get her an invite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God knew when those two got so chummy, though. Last I checked, Serenna was still slagging off Catherine&#39;s taste in shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna flashed a smug little grin at me. &#34;Bet you didn&#39;t expect to see me at the Laurent party,humh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a once-over. Designer dress, borrowed confidence, and a face that said &#39;please validate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Catherine. &#34;You might wanna be careful. Our dear cousin&#39;s been obsessed with Rhys since school. You sure you wanna parade him around with her sniffing after him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s face stiffened. She snapped her head towards Serenna, eyes sharp enough to shave an eyebrow clean off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna went the color of a bad spray tan. &#34;Don&#39;t listen to her! She thinks every girl on the planet&#39;s gagging for Rhys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re one of them,&#34; I said, all helpful-like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not! Not anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh.&#34; I raised an eyebrow. &#34;You&#39;ve got a new target then? Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna flailed for a second, then swung towards Catherine.&#34;Cathy,swear down, I don&#39;t have a thing for Rhys.I know you two are meant to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine wavered, chewing over whether to trust Serenna or not, before she gave a stiff little nod.&#34;|believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to me. &#34;This is an important party for Rhys. I hope you won&#39;t ruin it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms. &#34;Trust me, Catherine, I&#39;ve got nothing more to do with him. Whether this is the best night of his life or he trips over a napkin and dies of embarrassment, I couldn&#39;t care less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile wobbled but she pressed on. &#34;I know you&#39;re bitter, but please, be reasonable. There are a lot of business elites here tonight. Rhys is trying to secure an investment deal with the Laurents. Please don&#39;t let your personal feelings ruin this chance for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My personal feelings? You mean you don&#39;t want me to broadcast the fact that I dumped Rhys because he&#39;s a violent little SOB who hasn&#39;t got the spine to tell his mother he&#39;s in love with someone else? Instead, he just rolls over and accepts a fiancée he never wanted, because having an actual conversation might be too scary for him? Yeah, I can see how that wouldn&#39;t reafly help his investment pitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna glanced between us, eyes wide, clearly realizing that there was way more dirt under this rug than anyone had warned her about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine had the grace to blush, but not the good sense to back off.&#34;Whatever happened,&#34; she said, voice tight, &#34;you and I are stil family. And Rhys will be family too. So please, don&#39;t do anything you&#39;ll regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes so hard it was a miracle | could still see straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point trying to explain it to her. In Catherine&#39;s mind, I was still the pathetic little fangirl who used to trail after Rhys like a lost puppy. Nothing I said would change that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely made it two steps before I caught a shift in the air behind me, then that overpowering floral cloud Catherine called perfume hit my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A split second later, her heel clipped the back of my ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pitched forward, barely catching myself before I faceplanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could turn around, she yanked the long white tablecloth with both hands. Drinks, cakes, fancy canapé towers-all of it crashed to the floor in one glorious, sticky mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire ballroom snapped to attention.Heads whipped around so fast, I swear I heard a few necks crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right on cue, Serenna threw herself into the spotlight like she&#39;d rehearsed for it.&#34;Oh no! Mirabelle just trashed the party! She&#39;s ruining everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had barely left her mouth before there was a loud smack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook out my stinging hand. &#34;You tore the tablecloth off and tried to pin it on me. You think I&#39;m blind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine clutched her cheek. &#34;It wasn&#39;t me! It was you! You pulled it by accident... I swear...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine snapped out of her shock and delivered a slap of her own, this one right across Serenna&#39;s pretty little face. &#34;You really thought that stupid stunt would work? You think everyone here&#39;s as thick as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna screeched. &#34;How dare you hit me! I saw it with my own eyes-Mirabelle ruined the party on purpose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a random glass of wine off the wreckage and aimed it at Yvaine&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lunged to block it, but the wine still splashed down Yvaine&#39;s shoulder, soaking half her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been holding back all night. I really had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>grabbed Serenna by the hair and yanked. &#34;Go on. Try throwing another drink. See what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna howled like a dying cat, scrabbling at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine tried to rush over to help her, but Yvaine blocked her with a shove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You want a scene?&#34; Yvaine said, wild-eyed and grinning. &#34;Fine. Let&#39;s give &#39;em a bloody show.&#34;</p>
