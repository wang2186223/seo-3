                <p>Finn pulled a face. &#34;Please don&#39;t remind me that, as a fully grown, gainfully employed adult, my big Friday night plan is sharing reheated lasagna with my judgmental cat.&#34; He flashed another grin at me.&#34;You&#39;re at least better company. And less judgmental,I hope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;Alright then. Thanks. You&#39;re a lifesaver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got in the lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing a familiar face here felt like a little cosmic pat on the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we were in a conference room, I handed him my phone. &#34;Someone&#39;s been spreading lies about me. Can I sue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn scrolled through the screenshots, his jaw tightening. &#34;Jesus, these people are savage. Yeah, if all this is made up, it&#39;s definitely defamation. You can go civil, or even criminal if you want to push it. That kind of shit&#39;s not protected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all lies. Every word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn scrolled again, slower this time, then frowned.&#34;Wait. The guy who sent all this... Rhys Granger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head snapped up. &#34;The same Rhys who...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another nod from me. This time with bonus shame</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, I hadn&#39;t exactly been broadcasting my crush on Rhys, but let&#39;s be real, people knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hard not to, especially after Catherine uploaded scans of my diary to the school intranet like it was breaking news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boom.Instant humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone suddenly knew I had a tragic, textbook-case crush on my sister&#39;s boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>College life could be brutal. Especially when you were the headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I had friends. Including Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in the same club, and he&#39;d been nice to me from day one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never pried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When everyone else wanted the tea, Finn just quietly made sure I got included in all the club activities and listened whenever I wanted to vent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t graduated early and bolted off to law school,we probably would&#39;ve stayed close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, all these years later, seeing someone from my &#34;hopelessly simping for Rhys&#34; era made me want to crawl into the nearest bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly,I elaborated.&#34;We got engaged, then we,ah, broke up. He didn&#39;t take it well. So now he&#39;s playing petty, spreading stuff to make me look bad But he&#39;s the one who cheated, honest.&#34;7</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw it-somewhere behind the professional poker face, a little crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send me everything,&#34; he said, voice low. &#34;I&#39;ll handle the lawsuit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The comments are ongoing and getting worse. His fanboys are still going off on me. I&#39;ll send you more later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The worse, the better. If he keeps this up, the judge&#39;ll be begging to slap him with charges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool. Appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine was basically living on her phone at this point,refreshing like it was a second job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Rhys dropped a message in their group chat, one of her friends screenshotted it, sent it to her, and she passed it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forwarded the mess to Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But lawsuits took time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine didn&#39;t have that kind of patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her birthday was coming up, and she was out for blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I invited Rhys and Catherine to my birthday party,&#34;she called and told me.&#34;Watch how I ruin their day for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to be reasonable. &#34;Don&#39;t let those clowns mess up your birthday. It&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Making them squirm is the only thing that&#39;ll make it worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yielded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunday afternoon, I turned up at her house with a tiny,ribbon-wrapped box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Custom-made,&#34; I said, handing it over. &#34;Only one in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up. I love it!&#34; Yvaine was already clasping the necklace around her neck, twirling in front of the mirror, snapping selfies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cassian Langford walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine blinked.&#34;Wait, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted a sleek black gift bag like it was a peace offering. &#34;Your brother&#39;s stuck overseas. Sent me to play the charming stand-in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooh,what did he get me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held up two bags. &#34;One&#39;s from Emmett. The other&#39;s from me. Guess which is better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to her neck. &#34;Neither. This is the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian looked at me and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Yvaine greeted the incoming guests, Cassian stood next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several times, he opened his mouth like he wanted to say something, but in the end decided not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to ask him to spit it out when the party proper started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine had enough energy to power the city grid, and half of Skyline&#39;s social climbers were here kissing her arse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gift pile had mutated into a three-metre-high shrine in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was halfway through my mocktail when Rhys finally showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, he brought her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys glanced around the room and stared straight at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew I&#39;d be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showing up with Catherine was part of his whole pathetic power play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Message received, loud and clear: You can move on,babe,so can l.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Childish. Predictable. And not even original.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the crowd at the sight of those two, especially Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still hadn&#39;t healed completely from the beating Ashton gave him last week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d probably snuck out of the hospital with a bruised jaw and stitched-up lip just so he could try and make me jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squared my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine touched my arm. &#34;Let me have a go first.Come on. I&#39;ve got a whole thing planned. Even did a rehearsal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was feral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She elbowed one of her friends and flicked her chin in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the door, I caught someone disguised as a party photographer filming Rhys and Catherine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably another part of Yvaine&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I eased closer fora look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera caught them at just the right moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One frame even looked like a kiss-pure illusion,but it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, my phone vibrated.</p>
