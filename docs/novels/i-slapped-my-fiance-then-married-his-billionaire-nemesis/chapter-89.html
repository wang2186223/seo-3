                <p>Ashton gave Declan an approving nod, then turned to Gwendolyn. &#34;I told you l&#39;d bring my wife today.Anyone gives her trouble, they&#39;re taking me on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low, but it carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words weren&#39;t just meant for Gwendolyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were a warning shot to the entire Laurent clan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who&#39;d been whispering behind my back a second ago suddenly remembered how to shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few awkward beats passed before the party resumed its rhytm, the chatter awkward at first, then slowly picking up pace again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton took my hand and led me to the enormous sofa in the center of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I braced myself for the glares, the barbed questions, the sudden onset of passive aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, everyone smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some even tried to make it look convincing, though it was obvious they were clenching their molars behind those well-practiced grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d thought Ashton&#39;s (allegedly) illegitimate status would have put him in a precarious spot with the family,but apparently not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were treating him like royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared raise their voice, not even Reginald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which made me think-if people did suspect our marriage was a sham, would anyone actually have the guts to say it out loud?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why, exactly, was Ashton still going overboard with all those rehearsals?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like we needed to sell the act that hard, but he&#39;d been treating this like some kind of military drill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was the whole thing about his grandfather, Edouard Laurent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Ashton, the old man was on his deathbed at a nursing home and just wanted to see him get married before he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hence the fake marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hence the real marriage certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I finally saw Edouard, sure, he looked old and a bit frail-he needed a cane-but he didn&#39;t seem like he was about to kick the bucket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attitude towards me landed somewhere between Reginald and Declan-not overly warm, but not icy either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Polite. Neutral. Watchful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which tracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t like his son, Reginald, who wore every thought on his sleeve like a bad name tag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edouard hadn&#39;t built an empire by being the type to blurt out anything without weighing it first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thanked me for my gift, even complimented my dress-very grandfatherly,very smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d have thought he actually liked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the party got properly underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were speeches, gift-giving, cake-cutting,photo-taking-the whole shebang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Ashton was called into the study by his grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was left alone on the sofa, quietly matching names to faces and observing the dynamics of a multi-branch family tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt it almost immediately-that creeping sensation of being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just the polite kind, either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was surgical,skin-peeling scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to ignore it, but one particular stare coming from my right was doing a fantastic job of making my shoulders lock up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head and locked eyes with a woman in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isobel Brooke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jolt that went through me was embarrassingly visible-l actually flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze hadn&#39;t changed since high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still that cold, reptilian deadness, like she&#39;d skin me just to see how I was wired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was that reflexive revulsion, like when you feel something wet and squishy in your shoe and realize you&#39;ve just crushed a slug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Serenna Oakley mentioned that Isobel was coming back to town, I&#39;d thought, &#34;Skyline&#39;s huge. What are the odds we&#39;d ever bump into each other again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here we were, not even a few days later, and I was staring straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned slightly towards the girl next to me-dark hair, barely out of college, tapping away on her phone like she wasin her bedroom instead of at a party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton had introduced her earlier, but my brain had already dumped her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34; I asked, keeping my voice casual as I nodded subtly towards Isobel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, then followed my line of sight. &#34;Oh. That&#39;s Isobel... something. She&#39;s with Quentin, Ashton&#39;s second uncle&#39;s kid. Pretty sure they&#39;re getting engaged soon. That&#39;s probably why she&#39;s here. Y&#39;know,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tagging along as future family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Isobel&#39;s eyes had been slicing through me told me everything I needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenna had been right: Isobel still hated my guts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled slowly, the walls starting to press in around me like the air had thickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too many people had swarmed me already-chit-chatting, fake-smiling, all trying to suss out one thing:how close was I to Ashton?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if the answer was &#34;very,&#34; could I pull his strings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could I be their inside track, their pretty little pawn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt less like a party and more like a networking event, one where ninety percent of the guests shared the same surname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still too early to slip out without raising eyebrows, so I stood, smoothed my dress, and excused myself, saying I needed the loo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ducked right, away from the clinking of Baccarat crystal and the nauseating hum of polite small talk, out through a French window into actual air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grass under my heels was damp but welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gaggle of kids were shrieking with joy nearby, running in uncoordinated circles, high on cake and freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter floated on the breeze like bubbles about to pop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I passed the pool-glowing turquoise under the garden lights-when someone yelled my full name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle Vance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t heard it in years, but it still scraped across my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly, and there she was, strutting across the lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t seen you in a long while,&#34; Isobel said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped right in front of me, chin tilted,eyes scanning my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not long enough,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprised to see me?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;Surprised you&#39;re still in one piece. Given that bratty attitude and unfiltered mouth of yours,1figured by now your body would have washed up on a beach in some sketchy port city. Headless.&#34;</p>
