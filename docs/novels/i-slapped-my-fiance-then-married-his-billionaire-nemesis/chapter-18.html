                <p>i stood in the shower like a soggy pretzel, hoping the scalding water would burn the confusion out of my skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spoiler alert: it didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s words kept looping: &#34;Let&#39;s get married for real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excuse me? Was I concussed? Had I slipped and hit my head and developed some sexy-rich-boy-themed delusions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because, last I checked, we were in a mutually agreed fake engagement. No strings, no vows, no wedding hashtags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, there he was, five minutes ago, standing in front of me with that infuriatingly composed face and that annoyingly persuasive baritone, dropping a &#34;let&#39;s get hitched&#34; like he was suggesting brunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean, what even was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had leaned in, speaking in that velvet-coated,emotionless CEO tone like he was negotiating a merger, but the only thing merging in my brain was every single R-rated thought I had ever had about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t registered a single word, too busy inhaling his scent, staring at his lips, and letting my dumb,horny body teeter on the edge of blurting out yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank God for the ringing phone that cut through the haze before | threw myself at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cranked the water hotter, gently bumped my forehead against the tile, and groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with me? The second Ashton appeared, my logic disappeared like a side character in a horror film, leaving my poor brain cells to fend for themselves against thetsunami of testosterone and abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered if he saw through my act, if he knew that while he talked about strategic alliances, all I could think about was how his Adam&#39;s apple might taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he ever realized I was so into him that I wasn&#39;t even listening to his perfectly sensible, legally airtight proposal and was just picturing him naked... I&#39;d actually die. Of humiliation. Possibly on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it,&#34; I muttered, smacking the tap as if it owed me money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to rationalize it: maybe it was just the post-Rhys drought. After all, it had been awhile. My libido had gone into hibernation and Ashton had apparently jump-started it back to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, it wasn&#39;t all my fault. Even Agent Peggy Carter nearly face-planted into Steve Rogers&#39; pecs after the serum transformation, and she was literally a government-trained professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t resist a good set of chesticles, what hope did I have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just a regular woman with a pulse. And a highly reactive, dangerously thirsty hormone system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time | stepped out of my extra-long shower,my fingers were prunier than a sad raisin in the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of my wardrobe. Do I wear my usual sleepwear, which consisted of a threadbare uni tee with a coffee stain shaped suspiciously like Australia and a pair of shorts so tiny they&#39;d get flagged on Instagram?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or do I pretend to have dignity and put on something that didn&#39;t scream &#34;I&#39;m trying to seduce you&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, I reached for a long, ankle-length dressing gown I&#39;d bought during a misguided boho phase and never worn again. It was shapeless, scratchy, and about as flattering as a camping tarp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tiptoed out of my flat and paused at Ashton&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t pressured me for an answer when he suggested we get married. Said I should take my time and think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly, I was terrified that if I saw those hypnotic eyes of his again, I&#39;d throw all rational thought out the window and say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse, I was worried I&#39;d be desperate enough to suggest we celebrate our new relationship status with a cheeky roll in the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that that was something I&#39;d usually do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, I wasn&#39;t really a one-night-stand kind of girl either. Or a fake fiancée kind of girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, I was going through a phase called &#34;acting completely out of character and confusing the hell out of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally pushed open the door to his place and saw the empty living room, I wasn&#39;t sure if | was relieved or gutted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Possibly both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had left a note on the coffee table. Said he had to fly to another city for urgent business but he&#39;d be back in time for the party. Also said I could treat the place like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dangerous words. Because five seconds later, I was standing in his bedroom weighing the moral implications of crashing on his sofa versus full-on starfishing in his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It smelled like him, and I slept like a baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next morning, I woke up to find that my mum had called me roughly two dozen times and left a string of messages long enough to qualify as a podcast.Each one more shouty than the last, blaming me for Louisa&#39;s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys might have called too, but | wouldn&#39;t know-l&#39;d blacklisted him as soon as I&#39;d left the hospital There was also a message from Ashton. Louisa was out of surgery but still in ICU, loopy on anesthetic and not up for visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted back a quick thank you and inhaled a breakfast of cold toast and half a banana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it was time for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d barely set foot in the studio when I got summoned to the boss&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nyx Collective was a high-end jewelry design house co-founded by two bosses, but one of them was basically a ghost. As in, no one had seen him. Not once. He could&#39;ve been an Al for all I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word on the street was that this mystery founder had bankrolled 80% of the start-up costs,which made him the real power behind the velvet curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, the person currently sitting across from me wasn&#39;t that elusive financier, but the other boss. The one who did the actual work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Savannah Lane was pushing forty but looked like she&#39;d just been cast as the sexy barista in a romcom.Glowing skin, hair like a shampoo ad, and a wardrobe that screamed &#34;rich but relatable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vanna, I&#39;m really sorry,&#34; I said as soon as I walked in,before she could unleash the guilt-tripping Kraken. &#34;I know this week was a nightmare for the studio and l just... disappeared. I was sick, then there was other stuff, and time sort of did that thing where it flings itself into a volcano.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax.&#34; Savannah smiled at me. &#34;I didn&#39;t drag you in here to scold you. I&#39;m giving you a bonus.&#34;</p>
