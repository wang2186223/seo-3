                <p>Rhys, shocker, actually took the hilnt and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence dropped over the room llke à heavy curtáin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Ashton hed fust gone full Oladiator mode for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which was... weirdly touching, considering we were basically strangers who just happened to have a fake engagement contract and three awkward encounters under our belts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for that,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton shrugged. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me. He was pissing me off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, his gaze flicking to my wrist where Rhys&#39;s Neanderthal grip had left faint marks. He frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone started screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline&#39;s name lit up the screen like a warning siren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,no thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit decline without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five seconds later, the phone started ringing again. Persistent as a debt collector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing,I stabbed the answer button and held it to my ear.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely got the word out before a full-on banshee shriek exploded from the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle! How dare you hit your sister in front of everyone at the party?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.Serenna or Catherine must have run to mummy dearest with their version of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I thought about explaining. Telling her how Serenna started it, how Catherine had been stirring the pot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then... What was the point? Caroline would believe them over me if they told her the sky was green and pigs had started UberEats deliveries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stayod quiet, fust holdirig thie phone to my ear wis ahie shoutact, feellng absolutely nothing-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cothorno&#39;s barely back l Skytile and trying to rejoln trie soclak scene, and you humillated her in front of everyone! She fhally got an thvite to a major party, aney you wrecked RE There&#39;s video foofage, Mira, video!It&#39;s evorywhere! How do you expect us to save face now? Hlow&#39;s the Granger famlly supposed to gave face?If you&#39;ve got even a shred of decency left, you&#39;m drag your arse home, apologize to Cathering, then haul yourself over to the Grangers and grovel. You want to throw tantrums? Fine. But don&#39;t drag the rest of us down with you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at my watch. She managed that two-minute rant without stopping to breathe. A personal best,even for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like she&#39;d been waiting for an excuse to lose it on me, like this was her big comeback tour after the last time I refused to play ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone wash&#39;t even on speaker, but Ashton, sitting not five feet away, must have caught every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screaming from Caroline&#39;s end was still going strong when my screen lit up with another call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Louisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut in mid-rant:&#34;Mum, you&#39;ve been talking for so long you must be parched. Go grab a water bottle before you croak. I&#39;ve got another call. Gotta run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone started buzzing again. Louisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at it, jaw tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blowing off Rhys was easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa, not so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in the hospital recovering from a car accident that I was partially responsible for, and she&#39;d been nothing but kind to me my whole life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Birthday parties, scraped knees, family fights-Aunt Louisa had been there for all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably calling because she&#39;d heard about the mess at the party. Everyone else had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had nothing for her. 1 didry&#39;y want to the to Her And* wasn&#39;t my lob to cover for her áon&#39;s dumpater-fire tove fife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen went dark. Stralght to volcemat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton shlfted next to mo, looking tke he wanted to say something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hts phone went off before he could. He picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got tt,&#34; he sald after a minute, then hung up and looked át mé.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was my assistant. Loulsa Granger just collapsed at the hospital. They&#39;re trying to bring her around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was on my feet before he finished. I looked at the door, then back at him, frozen for half a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t miss a thing.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the party-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The guests can entertain themselves. They&#39;re grown-ups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>didn&#39;t argue. Just threw him a quick, grateful smile and we were off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eldergrove Private loomed up like a ghost I really didn&#39;t want to meet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time I&#39;d been here... yeah, not the best memnory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved it down and stormed inside, zeroing in on the nurses&#39; station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of barked directions later, I found Louisa&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow Granger stood posted like a bouncer at the door, arms folded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dad, Clive Granger, was slumped on a chair to the side, staring at thefloor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked straight up. &#34;Aunt Louisa, how is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow turned. The second she saw my face, her expression twisted like she&#39;d swallowed battery acid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;1 say a word. She fust swung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tho slap canio rast trd ugly, isut tiot tast enourgy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 blocked ＃ wfh my す배기-6目5y．</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow stoggered back a stop, surprlsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about slapping her back. I really dHd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But punching Aunt Louisa&#39;s daugliter right outside her hospitatroom felt like a bit too much, even for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow hissed, her voice shaking, &#34;You&#39;ve got some bloody nerve showing up here. What, trying to finish the job? Want to kill her for good this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms and stared her down. &#34;I&#39;m not here to swap insufts. I asked a simple question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You trashed the Laurent party tonight so bad the videos are blowing up all over group chats.Everyone&#39;s laughing at us, at the Grangers! And you&#39;re telling me you didn&#39;t mean it?&#34; Her voice cracked with fury. &#34;My mum treated you better than she treats me sometimes-hell, she pretty much raised you like her own-and this is how you pay her back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Classic Willow. She&#39;d hated my guts from day one. Thought I wasn&#39;t good enough for her big brother Rhys.Not rich enough. Not posh enough. Not educated enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to her, the only thing I brought to the table was my looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her head, I was the stray puppy Rhys was too soft to kick. The hanger-on. The charity case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Louisa had made her choice. She liked me. Loved me, even. Treated me like the daughter she probably wished Willow had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now Willow had all the ammo she needed to blame me for Louisa&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t done,either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first slap had failed, so she reared back for a second.</p>
