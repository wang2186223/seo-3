                <p>After leaving Yvaine&#39;s party, Rhys and Catherine didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them had the energy to pretend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole night had been one long marathon of humiliation, and they were both too pissed to bother hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the curb, Rhys pulled his coat tighter and grunted,&#34;Wait here. I&#39;ll get the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Catherine muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d barely turned the corner when some guy jumped out of the flowerbed, nearly scaring Catherine to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cathy!&#34; the boy hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t have been older than twenty, and he was wearing a rent-a-cop uniform two sizes too big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized him instantly and dragged him right back behind the bushes by the scruff of his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails dug into his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you insane?&#34; she hissed, wild-eyed. &#34;I told you not to contact me! How the hell did you even find me?If anyone sees us-Jesus, I&#39;m screwed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook her off and flicked a half-smoked cigarette onto the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couldn&#39;t reach you on the phone,&#34; he said with a shrug. &#34;Had to come find you myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth twitched like she wanted to slap him,or scream-or both. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money.What else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad&#39;s getting worse. Docs say surgery&#39;s non-negotiable. It&#39;s gonna cost two hundred grand. You&#39;re going to give it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s face changed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d just been bled by Yvaine for fifteen grand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another two hundred K?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have that kind of cash lying around in her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed him, arms crossed, one brow lifted high enough to scrape the moon. &#34;Is he really that sick? Or did you gamble yourself into another hole?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy&#39;s jaw twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for just a second. &#34;Of course it&#39;s Dad.You think I&#39;d lie to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even bother to hide the disbelief in her voice. &#34;You&#39;ve gambled it away again, haven&#39;t you?|told you, I can&#39;t keep bailing you out. If you&#39;re not going to quit, then I&#39;m done. I&#39;m not your bloody ATM.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy snatched out his phone and shoved it in her face. &#34;Look! The doctor messaged me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even look at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could have been porn or pizza coupons for all she cared. &#34;I don&#39;t have the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bullshit!&#34; he shouted. &#34;You&#39;re Rhys Granger&#39;s side piece. One of his gifts to you probably costs more than my old man&#39;s surgery!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine&#39;s face drained to a pale, waxy white. &#34;I&#39;m not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We blew so much cash on you back then,&#34; the boy spat. &#34;And now when it&#39;s me and my dad needing help,you&#39;re suddenly broke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted,shaky, like she&#39;d just been slapped. &#34;I&#39;m not... not a side piece. Rhys and I, we&#39;re together.Properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even better,&#34; he scoffed. &#34;Thought I heard he ditched Mirabelle Vance. So what&#39;s the holdup? Why hasn&#39;t he put a ring on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine took a sharp breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was trying to bottle her panic and save it for later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send you the money. In a few days. Just go. If anyone sees you, it&#39;s over for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy didn&#39;t budge. &#34;A few days? How many&#39;s a few?&#34;&#34;Ten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s too long!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Three. Now go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. But if that money&#39;s not in my account by day three... you know what I can do.&#34; He bolted before she could answer, disappearing down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he vanished, Rhys&#39;s car rolled up to the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine clenched her fists so hard her nails dug little half-moons into her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid into the passenger seat like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys glanced at her lazily as he pulled back into traffic.&#34;Saw you chatting with someone just now. Friend of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine forced a breath, smiling like she hadn&#39;t just been blackmailed behind a hedge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music in the car helped drown out the thudding in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Just someone asking for directions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; Rhys muttered, eyes on the road. &#34;Figured. No way you&#39;d hang out with someone wearing knock-off trainers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine bit down on her lip, nodded, and forced a laugh. &#34;Yeah. Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Rhys, Catherine was still the same spoiled little debutante, born to designer shoes and Sunday brunches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after moving abroad, she&#39;d been living the rich-girl dream, at least according to her Instagram updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that she might know someone outside his curated little world was simply unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drove in silence for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared out the window like it might show her a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweet. Careful. Like someone testing the temperature of bathwater before diving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys... I saw this bag the other day. Really pretty. But I&#39;m short on cash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two hundred thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That got his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head snapped to her, brows pulling into that tight little V he always wore when his mood soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which, lately, was all the damn time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already paid for your flights and hotels in France.What the hell do you need two hundred grand for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine pouted. &#34;But it&#39;s the last one, Rhys. Limited edition. They&#39;re not making it again. I&#39;ve literally never  wanted anything more in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys didn&#39;t budge. &#34;You don&#39;t need a handbag that costs two hundred grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine leaned in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Close enough that her hair brushed his arm,her breath on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured something low against his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth twitched. &#34;W/ith your mouth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And anywhere else you like. I&#39;ll wear the red corset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled hard through his nose. &#34;Yeah, alright.&#34;</p>
