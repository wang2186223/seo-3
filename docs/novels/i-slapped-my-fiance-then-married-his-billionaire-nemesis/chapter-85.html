                <p>&#34;I admit nothing. When I choose to come back has absolutely nothing to do with you. Same goes for whether you hit Eliza Black&#39;s deadline-none of it&#39;s my problem. So stop projecting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet let out a derisive hum, clearly not buying a word I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she said, looking all pleased with herself. &#34;Even if you agreed to come back, it&#39;s too late. I&#39;ve already set things up with Eliza. She&#39;s going to blow up at the film festival in a few days, and once she posts about me on social media, I&#39;ll be a star designer. You won&#39;t even be good enough to carry my bags, let alone keep up with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back to my desk, letting her ramble on while l ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was aboutto find out the hard way that with all her rush and last-minute changes to the designs, there was no way she was going to hit the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if poor Eliza Black ended up looking like a fool at the film festival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that little verbal cage match, Violet actually chilled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too busy fantasizing about her big break as a &#39;world-famous jewelry designer&#39; to bother picking fights with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days passed without her dragging me into another playground-level shouting match, and that suited me just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that I had time for her nonsense anyway-l had bigger things on my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The main event I&#39;d been &#39;rehearsing&#39; for was finally looming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before Edouard Laurent&#39;s 80th birthday, Ashton called me into the living room after dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve both been busy,&#34; he said, sitting ramrod straight, looking all businesslike. &#34;We&#39;ve slacked off on our practice. Tomorrow&#39;s the party, so we&#39;re doing a quick run-through tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said, without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d barely seen each other in the past few days, what with me being up to my eyeballs in jewelry work for Octavia Grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been kind of a relief, but now...I was nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, I&#39;d be in front of the whole Laurent family with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t afford to mess up, not with everything on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped forward and-without even thinking-lowered myself onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The move was so smooth, I surprised myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thighs locked around his as if by muscle memory, and the jolt that shot up my spine was instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way to pretend I didn&#39;t feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s hands found my waist like magnets, his palms hot through the fabric, his fingers resting just on the edge of familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, I&#39;d been trying so hard not to think about him since that kiss in the car, but it was impossible now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The angle of our bodies, the tension pulsing between us-it was the backseat all over again, minus the leather upholstery and the eavesdropping driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes pinned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d always known that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now they looked like Kashmir sapphires-deep, vivid, seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stone that could mesmerize you into reaching out... and slice you open if you weren&#39;t careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I wasn&#39;t so sure another &#39;rehearsal&#39; was a smart idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I was toeing the edge of something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wrong breath and I&#39;d tumble-straight into territory I couldn&#39;t joke my way out of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? Not bad, right?&#34; I forced a grin, coward&#39;s instinct kicking in. &#34;Still got the muscle memory. Tomorrow,no one will suspect a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to ease off his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think we need another rehearsal. I&#39;m kind of exhausted. Let&#39;s skip practice tonight. I promise I won&#39;t embarrass you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d handled enough black-tie dinners and brutal design competitions to hold my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rich snobs, harsh judges, backhanded compliments-l&#39;d seen it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yeah, not to be vain or anything, but I&#39;ve got a face that doesn&#39;t hurt either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just about to push myself off him when his hand slid around the back of my neck, fingers pressing lightly,holding me in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a firm believer in being prepared,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could come up with something clever, his grip tightened, and I pitched forward, right into him-chest to chest, thigh to thigh, heat igniting where our skin met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his mouth was on mine, soft but unyielding, and the contact wiped out every half-formed thought in my brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm...&#34; I tried to speak, but his kiss swallowed the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like the world stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing I could feel, taste, was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue slid against mine, slow at first, then deeper, tasting every inch of me like he was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips were warm, firm, and everything else faded into the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just the heat, the friction of our bodies pressed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sinking into him, my fingers digging into his shirt, pulling him closer, like I wanted to lose myself in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss made my head spin, faster and faster, and then-suddenly-he moved, and I was on my back, with him above me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft give of the sofa beneath me was the only thing keeping me anchored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest pressed against mine, tight enough that I couldn&#39;t breathe easily, but it was exactly what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of him felt safe, like nothing could touch me as long as he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And, damn it, when his lips left mine, my whole body felt like it had melted into the sofa, as if I&#39;d been soaked in warm honey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was breathless, dizzy, and very much wanted to pull him back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s eyes locked onto mine, dark with something I couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped from my lips, lingering on the curve of my neck, and I saw him tense, his jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t reed to be a genius to know he was struggling to keep his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying so hard not to lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand brushed the bare skin of my lower back as I shifted slightly, and holy hell, if his fingers didn&#39;t send a shockwave through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No fabric, just his skin on mine, and suddenly all I could think about was how much I wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath hitched, and for a moment, I thought he might lose control, might take it all the way.</p>
