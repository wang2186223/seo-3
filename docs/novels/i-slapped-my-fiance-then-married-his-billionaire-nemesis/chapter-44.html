                <p>From the delicate curve of the setting to the custom clasp detail, I&#39;d bet my sketchbook it was designed from scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And unless Ashton had been carrying it around for fun,it meant he&#39;d pulled this together in the last few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened like my lungs were being rude and forgetting how to function.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he leaned in closer, and suddenly the side of my ear went warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt something-light, soft, like lips-but it was gone so fast I wasn&#39;t sure it had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached forward and gently touched the necklace now hanging around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That brooch didn&#39;t suit you,&#34; he said. &#34;This fits better.You like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to find my voice, just barely. &#34;Yeah... I like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t even seen what it looked like on me, but l didn&#39;t need a mirror to know it was stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of piece that made people stop mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton gave a little satisfied smile, then his eyes flicked to the ring box still sitting on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I gave you a gift,&#34; he said. &#34;Aren&#39;t you meant to give me one too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea gift-exchanging was part of the program.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I didn&#39;t prepare anything. Can I get you something in a few days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you have one ready,&#34; he said, tapping the ring box with a finger. &#34;Give me this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I sat up straight. &#34;No, l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ring was from my grandmother</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d left it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d planned to keep it, maybe redesign it one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely not give it away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see what it is,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gold band sat quietly inside, old but elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not pure gold-it had silvery floral etchings around the band that shimmered if you caught them at the right angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s gaze dipped. &#34;This one&#39;s nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s an old style. Not worth much.Probably not your thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I think it looks good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was easy and casual, like he hadn&#39;t just put me on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t push again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which somehow made it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now if I didn&#39;t give it to him, I&#39;d look petty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| hesitated. Overthought. Stared at his annoyingly handsome face while he sat there pretending to be totally chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the silence stretched too long, he said,&#34;If the ring&#39;s too valuable and you&#39;d rather get something else for me, I understand. It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too valuable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must be kidding, and he knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The necklace he gave me was worth a hundred of this ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was calm, same as always,but there was this...quiet sort of disappointment in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goddammit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved the box toward him. &#34;Fine. But don&#39;t regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| won&#39;t.&#34; He took the ring, waited, looked at me expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I made no move to put the ring on for him, he slid it onto his ring finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a little snug, but still looked good on him,because of course it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit down on my lip. &#34;Might be too small. I can get a new one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton held up his hand and turned it, checking it out like he&#39;d just scored something from a private auction.&#34;Fits fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...Right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine kicked on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told him to drop me at Nyx Collective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, I said, &#34;You don&#39;t have to keep calling me Miss Vance, by the way. Especially not in front of people. If we&#39;re doing this fake marriage thing,we might as well commit to the bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton glanced at me, the corner of his mouth twitching. &#34;What should I call you instead? Mrs.Laurent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Just call me by my name</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Mirabelle? Or... Mira?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like-actual physical reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Full-body static, tingly as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just one word and my brain went straight to the gutter-like, zero detours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could totally picture him saying my name like that in bed,slow and low, all heat and hands and messed-up sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clamped my legs together on reflex and stared hard out the car window, praying he hadn&#39;t seen my face go up in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... Mira&#39;s... Mira&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were about halfway there when he asked, &#34;Still not doing the wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wedding?&#34; I blinked. &#34;Yeah. Still a no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This whole thing was a contract with a one-year expiration date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wedding reception would&#39;ve turned it into front-page fodder for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went quiet for a second, then said. &#34;Alright.Whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of the wedding reminded me of why he&#39;d agreed to go along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him. &#34;When are we visiting your grandfather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said he wanted to see you get married before he.I&#39;d have thought he&#39;d want to meet me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That... Right, he would love to meet you. I&#39;ll talk to his, ah, doctors and see about arranging a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he staying at a hospital then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A sanatorium. His condition doesn&#39;t permit him to move about much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should bring something. What kind of presents will he like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile entered his voice. &#34;Your presence alone will suffice to make his day. That, and the wedding certificate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; I couldn&#39;t tear my eyes off the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pendant necklace looked like something I&#39;d have designed in a fever dream-if I had fifty years of experience, a royal jeweler for a mentor, and spent my childhood playing dress-up with the Crown Jewels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slowed as we neared Nyx Collective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me a sec.&#34; I took out the marriage certificate,snapped a couple photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton glanced over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a sheepish grin. &#34;Promised Yvaine I&#39;d text her as soon as we got it done. Forgot earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the car stopped, I jumped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked off, I caught a glimpse of Ashton still sitting there, holding his own certificate like he was reading between the lines.</p>
