                <p>That stopped me. Just for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Louisa Granger. The only member of that genetically cursed family I&#39;d actually liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to call me her &#34;darling girl,&#34; and she meant it. She remembered my birthday. She bought me books I actually read. She once told me l had a fire in me and that it was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, my own mother thought my jewelry designs were a hobby l&#39;d grow out of, and that fire belonged in fireplaces or hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to dinner,&#34; Rhys carried on, his tone clipped.&#34;Just don&#39;t say anything to her about...you know. Us.&#34;Of course he wanted me to lie for him. Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. Brave of you,&#34; I said, my voice sharp enough to julienne a zucchini. &#34;What happened to that big manly energy you were showing off with Catherine? If you&#39;re so smitten, why not bring her to dinner and introduce her to the fam? Or are you worried Mummy might not approve of your shiny new mistress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reply. I didn&#39;t wait for him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up, tossed my phone on the sofa,and muttered,&#34;Bloody coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half past ten. I&#39;d just put down the TV remote and dug out an unfinished sketch from my tablet, thinking l could snack my way into some inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely got two bites of leftover lo mein before the lights cut outlike a budget horror film. One second I was basking in LED brilliance, the next I was plunged into darkness, lit only by the ghostly glow of my tablet screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I practically launched myself off the sofa. My heart did a triple backflip before I realized it was just a blackout Again. Because of course this floor had the electrical stability of a soggy biscuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fumbled for my phone and rang Mr. Donnelly. No answer. I called again. Still nothing. Classic Donnelly-less &#34;property manager,&#34; more&#34;professional ghoster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t have put it past him to fake a blackout just to speed up my moving out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d already said I was leaving. Did he really need to go full supervillain with the power supply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder this place was cheap. Faulty wiring and a landlord who disappeared faster than my willpower around cake. Still, for rent that low, I couldn&#39;t stay mad for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, I was out of here soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grumbling under my breath, I groped my way into the stairwell to check the fuse box. Of course,it was at a height best suited for NBA players</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m nearly 5&#39;7&#34; and had to stand on tiptoe like | was doing pirouettes in the dark-only with more swearing and less grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it helped. I stared at the jumble of switches like it was written in hieroglyphics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bloody hell,&#34; I muttered, returning to fetch a chair before I electrocuted myself out of sheer guesswork.Just as I reached my door, the neighbor&#39;s door eased open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like me, he was using his phone as a torch, which gave me a clear view of his face. His fringe,usually styled like a GQ cover shoot, was loose and damp, making him look about five years younger and way too good -looking for the average tenant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Droplets slid from his hair down his neck, over his collarbone, down over muscles that really needed a warning label.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had on nothing but a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just.A. Towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by the little rivers of water tracing down his torso, he&#39;d rushed out of the shower to investigate the blackout without bothering with trivial things like clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried very hard not to ogle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| failed spectacularly To be fair, it was like being hit in the face with a very well-sculpted Greek statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A very wet,half-naked, annoyingly sexy Greek statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time I saw him, he&#39;d been dressed to the nines in a tailored suit. I hadn&#39;t expected him to be this...stacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like finding out your accountant moonlighted as a Calvin Klein model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain short-circuited for a moment. I just stood there, blatantly gawking like some creep on a stag do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught me staring. Of course he did. His eyes-partly hidden under a mess of damp fringe-crinkled ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he glanced at my ears, probably noticing that they were turning the same color as a cherry slushie,and finally turned back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came back a minute later wearing a white T-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked and cleared my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he was fully clothed-or at least pretending to be-the tension eased a bit and my brain came back online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I launched into an explanation about the blackout and the fuse box situation. &#34;Sorry to bother you. I didn&#39;t expect the power to go out at this time of night, and the landlord&#39;s decided to ghost me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no bother,&#34; he said in that deep,low voice that probably doubled as white noise for insomniacs. He brushed past me and headed to the fuse box. He didn&#39;t even have to stretch. Where I&#39;d nearly dislocated my toes trying to reach it, he just flicked the switches like he was turning on a light in a fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Must be nice, being tall and useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squinted at the fuse box for a moment, flicked another switch, then muttered, &#34;Looks like the main breaker&#39;s loose. Might&#39;ve been knocked about-cheap casing, maybe. I&#39;ll see if I can tighten it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, okay,&#34; I said, nodding along like I was following,even though my brain had already checked out of the electrical conversation and checked into the gym that was his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white cotton T-shirt clung to him in all the right places-or maybe it was just thin enough to show off everything he had going on underneath. Every time he moved, muscles shifted under the fabric like they were choreographing a silent dance routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hypnotic. Like watching bread rise. Or lava Lamps. But hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have been staring at his back like a total weirdo for a full two minutes before | remembered | was supposed to be helping, not leering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat. &#34;If it&#39;s a hassle, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s late anyway. I should probably just call the landlord in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning around, he said, &#34;There&#39;s a storage room near the stairs. Might be a pair of pliers in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grab them for me.&#34;</p>
