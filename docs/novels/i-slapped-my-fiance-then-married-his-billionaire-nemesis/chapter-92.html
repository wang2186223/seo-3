                <p>Ashton had never sprinted that fast in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, by the time he dragged Mirabelle out of the water, her lips were blue,her body limp in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been too fucking slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew it the moment her head lolled back and she didn&#39;t open her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid her down on the poolside tiles, soaking wet and ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted her head, checked her airway, locked his hands over her sternum, and began to pump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast.Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick, ugly rhythm that scared the hell out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then mouth-to-mouth-his breath into hers, again and again, his heart hammering so loud it drowned out everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come on,Mirabelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,she jerked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water poured from her mouth, splattering against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes stayed shut, but her breathing started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shallow, ragged-each gasp as if it hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton scooped her up, holding her tight against him, and tore back into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party noise hit him like a slap-laughing, music, chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the stairs three at a time, ignoring the stunned faces and dropped glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every mouth hung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maids scrambled behind him, their arms loaded with towels and blankets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton kicked open his bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid her down carefully on the bed, the thick duvet pulled around her, tucking her in tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so small, trembling like a leaf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dress was soaked through, plastered to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silk shawl was a soggy tangle, knotted at her elbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton wrapped his arms around her, blanket and all, pulling her against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More blankets!&#34; he barked. &#34;Get the shower on. Full heat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle&#39;s eyelids fluttered like she was caught in a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breaths came in short bursts, her mouth half-open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He touched her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His own hands weren&#39;t exactly warm either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle,&#34; he said quietly, leaning close. &#34;Mirabelle, can you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even a twitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent, the bath&#39;s ready!&#34; a maid called from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton lifted Mirabelle again, cradling her like a baby, and strode into the en suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam billowed from the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped straight in, shoes and all, then knelt and lowered her into the water, still fully clothed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second her skin hit the water, she lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No!&#34; she thrashed like she was being electrocuted, her nails digging into his forearm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh. Shh, Mirabelle, it&#39;s me. It&#39;s not the pool.You&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought harder, slippery and fast, her elbow smashing into his chest so hard he staggered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breath was punched out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesus.He hadn&#39;t realized she could hit like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle,&#34; he said, dragging her into his lap, one arm locking around her ribs as he pulled her back from the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to him like she&#39;d drown if she let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gut tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d seen people in shock, but this was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped her cheeks. &#34;Talk to me, Mirabelle. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked wildly, not quite focusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she was stuck in something he couldn&#39;t see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct screamed at him to fix it, but he didn&#39;t know what the hell he was fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked her up again and carried her back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered the whole way, silent, small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as her body touched the mattress, some of the tension eased from her limbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not much. But enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint sound slipped from her lips-a low, broken moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t think she knew she&#39;d made it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt it more than heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It cut straight through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not tight enough to hurt, just enough to make sure she knew she wasn&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes flickered, and her eyes blinked open-clouded,confused,distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her face, his thumb brushing her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle.What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head,barely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clutched at his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone... someone dragged me in..&#34; Her voice trembled, words slurring, breath short. &#34;It was Brooke...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blood turned to ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t caught most of it, just the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curled his hand around her shoulder, firm enough to anchor her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me.&#34; His voice was calm, but iron-threaded. &#34;Say it again. What did she do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mumbled something broken, a rasp more than a sentence, trembling harder in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was slipping fast, like she was underwater and drifting deeper every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton recalled what he&#39;d seen earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saving Mirabelle from drowning had been his only thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that the panic was ebbing, he remembered there had been someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman, climbing up from the other end of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t spared her a second glance at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent?&#34; a maid&#39;s soft voice broke through the haze behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was holding a stack of neatly folded clothes. &#34;Should we help Mrs. Laurent change into something dry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton stood. &#34;Give me the clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid hesitated but handed them over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone cleared out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton crouched down beside the bed and gently pulled away the duvet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white dress clung to her body like a second skin, soaked through, transparent in all thewrong places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled one of the thick towels off the chair and wrapped it around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mirabelle,&#34; he said softly, brushing a wet strand of hair from her cheek. &#34;I need to get you dry. You&#39;re safe now. It&#39;s me. Ashton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flinched when he tugged at the zipper on her dress, a feeble jerk that didn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers gripped his wrist for a second, then let go, as if recognizing his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe now,&#34; he murmured again. &#34;It&#39;s just me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peeled the dress off, slowly,carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin was cold and slick, goosebumps running up her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He draped the first towel over her and started drying her off, using slow circular movements, paying attention to her limbs, her back, her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t protest, not really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just shivered, her chest rising and falling like she couldn&#39;t quite settle into her own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hen came the bra and panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton hesitated, the towel paused midair.</p>
