                <p>Rhys staggered backward, arms flailing like someone had yanked the battery out of his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t let up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rhys was still figuring out which direction gravity was pulling him, Ashton calmly slipped off his watch and shoved it into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he cracked his neck and grabbed Rhys by the collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And started swinging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until | lost count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until Rhys was spitting blood and barely able to stand,his body folding like wet cardboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Ashton still wasn&#39;t done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let Rhys drop like a sack of compost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he strolled over and stomped on him in the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real slow. Real controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every hit drew another mouthful of blood from Rhys.like some horrific vending machine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton!&#34;| lunged forward, grabbing his arm with both hands. &#34;Jesus, you&#39;ll kill him! Stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were so blue they were almost black,holding a kind of still fury that made my stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen him angry before, but this was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was execution mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers trembled on his arm, and I let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ashton,please stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t, I might have to come to Rhys&#39;s defense,as much as I hated the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But whatever switch had flipped inside him... switched back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face emptied out. Blank again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked once, and the violence vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked at mny wrist, the one Rhys had grabbed earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer and took it in his hand like it was made of glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumb brushed over the skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need a mirror to know it looked bad-deep red, starting to purple, ugly against my pale skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hurt you,&#34; he said in a soft voice,way too soft for someone who just played Mortal Kombat with my ex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s nothing. Looks worse than it is.&#34; I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened just slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not rough. Just firm enough to stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ll put something on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started walking me toward his flat like it was already decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which,knowing him,it probably was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind us, Rhys groaned like a dying raccoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his voice came out, all wet and wheezy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you can&#39;t do this... this is assault... I&#39;ll call the cops... I&#39;m calling the fucking cops...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his pocket with a shaky hand, only to realize his phone had flown halfway down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was lying in the corner, completely out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started crawling for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t even get ten centimeters before a shiny leather shoe came down on his hand. Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes traveled up-sleek suit trousers, crisp jacket,perfectly calm rage-until he met Ashton&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut him right up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton looked down like Rhys was something stuck to his sole. &#34;Yeah, call the cops. Let&#39;s tell them you stole an access card, broke in after midnight, and tried to assault and kidnap my wife. Definitely a 911 moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t... I wasn&#39;t kidnapping Mira, I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the fuck up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pressed harder on his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys let out a guttural squeal and bit his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton pulled out his phone and made a call, his voice calm enough to scare me more than the shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two security guards showed up so fast I thought they&#39;d been hiding behind the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One grabbed Rhys&#39;s left arm, the other his right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Laurent, this is on us. We&#39;ll have him taken to the station immediately. Won&#39;t happen again, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the hallway finally emptied and all the testosterone was gone, Ashton turned to me, caught my wrist again, and led me into his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurt,&#34; he said. &#34;Let me see what I can do. Then we&#39;ll go to the hospital, just to be sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Seriously.&#34; My voice didn&#39;t sound very convincing, mostly because I was too busy eyeing the minimalist murder-den he called a flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked exactly like the place across from my old apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black, white, grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything sharp-edged and spotless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single personal object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even a coffee mug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the sofa-if you could call it that; it felt like a furniture showroom display-and tried not to fidget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton crouched in front of me with a first aid kit,ignoring my objection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wrist throbbed, but what made me flinch wasn&#39;t the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the memory of that look in his eyes earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ice-cold, controlled violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, fingers just above my skin, and glanced up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess he noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you upset I hit Rhys Granger?&#34;1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice wasn&#39;t smug or apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just...quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too quiet for a man who nearly beat someone into a coma five minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hadn&#39;t grabbed his arm when I did, he probably would have finished the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t scared for Rhys; I was scared Ashton might actuallykill the guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t answer, he went back to dabbing antiseptic on my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell from the slightly downturned shape of his mouth that he was stewing in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been in love with Rhys for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid,wasted years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t blame him for assuming I still had a soft spot somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I ddidn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34;I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up again, searching my face as if he thought I might be lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t upset for him. I was just scared you&#39;d go full psycho and kill the guy. And then you&#39;d go to prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he smiled. &#34;So you were worried about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. If you&#39;d actually murdered him,we&#39;d both be in handcuffs, with me as an accessory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew what I was doing. He wouldn&#39;t have died.&#34; He stood up. &#34;So, you no longer feel anything for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Then you probably won&#39;t feel anything either if |tell Dominic to make sure Rhys has a rough night in holding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone.</p>
