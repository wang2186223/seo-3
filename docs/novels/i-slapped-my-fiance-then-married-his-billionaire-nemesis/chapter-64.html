                <p>While Mirabelle was sitting in the bistro with Finn,ten miles away and sixty-eight floors up, Ashton finally found out-second-hand-that she was suing Rhys Granger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the glass doors to his office swung shut, Ashton hurled a thick stack of contracts straight at Cassian Langford&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hit landed with a meaty smack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell didn&#39;t you tell me earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian stumbled back, one hand catching the papers, the other slapped to his ribs. &#34;Jesus, mate,trying to bruise a lung or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in his jaw said plenty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian straightened, rubbing at his ribs with exaggerated flair. &#34;Look, I didn&#39;t know either,alright?It&#39;s not like Rhys and I are besties in a group chat.How the fuck was I supposed to know he was running his mouth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how do you know now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yvaine&#39;s birthday party. Mirabelle had a go at him.Rhys and his girlfriend were both there. Things got...messy.I just kinda forgot to mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s jaw flexed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were already dark, but now they looked like wet asphalt before a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was her birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three days ago? You told me to go,remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another folder slammed into Cassian&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what exactly did I tell you to do at that party?Ogle the influencers? I said watch Mirabelle. That prick Granger was dragging her name through the dirt and you didn&#39;t think to open your mouth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian held up his hands. &#34;Look, it wasn&#39;t that bad.Yvaine backed her up, and Rhys fucked off with his girlfriend. Situation handled. Plus, Mirabelle&#39;s got a lawyer. She&#39;s already suing him. What more can you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton jabbed the intercom. &#34;Get Legal up here.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian sank into an armchair and watched while Ashton launched a barrage of clipped instructions at the head of Legal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the door clicked shut behind the lawyer,Cassian gave Ashton a slow once-over and clicked his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian clicked again, grinning. &#34;Just... never seen you like this. You&#39;re properly gone for her, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s answer was bone-dry. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you at The Rookery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah. About how you met her years ago and it was all fate and stardust or whatever. But I don&#39;t get the same energy from her, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;What energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one you&#39;re radiating right now.&#34; Cassian pointed at him. &#34;That look on your face whenever her name comes up. You need a mirror, mate. You&#39;re practically glowing. Your eyes are sparkling like a fucking TikTok filter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;ve got time to sit there sounding like an extra from Gossip Girl, you&#39;ve got time to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian smirked. &#34;What, are you shy now? Come on,Ash, we&#39;ve been through hell together. I thought I&#39;d seen every version of you. Turns out I missed the one who acts like a high school kid on his first date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton flicked him a glance. &#34;Not all of us were teenage Don Juans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d prefer to be called a young DiCaprio. Anyway,I  was chatting with her at Yvaine&#39;s party, right? Tried to dig a little. For your sake, obviously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to keep an eye on her. Not interrogate her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian raised both hands. &#34;Whoa, calm down. If it&#39;s illegal to be a concerned friend, throw the cuffs on.Anyway, I asked her a few things-normal stuff. She was polite, yeah, but guarded. Real careful. Didn&#39;t give me a damn thing I could use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ashton could snap at him again, Cassian added in a hurry, &#34;Not that I was looking for things to use against her. But you know how it is, people in our circle burn each other for sport. Doesn&#39;t hurt to do due diligence,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton nodded for him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows about her and Rhys. They were engaged, what, three years? Four? That&#39;s practically a decade in our world. Then she dumps him and marries you in less time than it takes me to replace my tailor. You can&#39;t tell me that&#39;s not a red flag.&#34;</p>
