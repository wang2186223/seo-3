                <p>I didn&#39;t even remember how I got out of that house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I had was one single, sharp conclusion echoing through my head-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must not be their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had to find out the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the only explanation I could cling to-because otherwise,how could I live with the idea that my own parents were capable of being this cruel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I got back to my apartment,I collapsed into bed. I didn&#39;t move until my phone started ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Yvaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for her to ask anything-l just blurted out everything my parents had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And,yes... I also told her about the one-night stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left out the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvaine let out a scream so high-pitched it could probably shatter glass and kill all the plants in my apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had a one-night stand?! And you didn&#39;t FaceTime me live from the scene?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I switched the phone to speakerand tossed it onto the couch,slumping back into the cushions with my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice kept going like fireworks:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is he? What mythological realm did this man come from? Are you telling me you actually, finally let Rhys go? Don&#39;t tell me-he looks like Michelangelo carved him, or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused. I could picture her sitting up on her sofa,wrapped in a blanket, making that infamous,exaggerated gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A wand of unnatural proportions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are-so. Incredibly. Annoying,&#34; I groaned,dragging a pillow over my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re dodging the topic,&#34; she snapped back instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never hid things from Yvaine. Not even the ugliest parts of my story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even... last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept with a man whose last name I couldn&#39;t remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just to peel Rhys&#39;s residue off my skin-for a minute,an hour, a night-whatever it took to feel free again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it liberating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was revenge, escape, and a cocktail of both with a guilt chaser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Yvaine wasn&#39;t here to judge me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here to douse the flames-even if it was only through the tiny speaker in my living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least tell me this,&#34; she said suddenly, her voice lowering,softer. &#34;Was he hot? Like, close-your-eyes -and-you-can-still-see-his-brow-bone hot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...Hot,&#34; I muttered into the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when he touched you... did it feel like he knew you were something rare? Like you were a limited edition made just for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw. Didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god,&#34; she breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually slept with someone who was worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes closed, and for some reason,that one sentence felt like a suture pulled gently over the tear in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My parents&#39; voices still echoed in my head-sharp,suffocating, like burnt toast you couldn&#39;t scrape off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way they&#39;d discarded me-so clinical, so composed. Like tossing out a baby bottle that had outlived its use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira,&#34; her voice shifted again, quieter, steadier. &#34;You can do anything. Screw up, break down, love the wrong person-it&#39;s all fine. But you can&#39;t carry all of this alone anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just pulled my knees to my chest and pressed my face into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Wherever you go Whatever you do. I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 didn&#39;t cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear | didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just clenched my jaw, shut my eyes tighter, and swallowed the words thank you like a pill I couldn&#39;t quite get down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to go to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that my parents had made it clear | was disposable, my job was the one thing I couldn&#39;t afford to screw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course,they believed I worked as a barista.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d forbidden me from having a corporate job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their minds, once married, I should be home full-time-a perfectlittle housewife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I never told them what I really did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my exhausted body out the door, I headed to Ground &amp; Pound-my workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name? Chosen because the owner figured it had no real brand potential. Was it a sexy coffee shop? An underground MMA gym? Who knew? Who cared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was decent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for now-safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well... until it no longer existed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My boss, Benny, greeted me like I was his parole officer-nervous, sweaty, probably two seconds away from peeing his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in his forties, wore a man bun that did no favors for his hairline, and his arms were covered in tattoos best described as regrettable-one of which featured a goat wearing sunglasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to be here today. I was just about to call you...&#34; He stared at the floor. &#34;You&#39;re not on the schedule anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excuse me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been... let go. I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t want to,but... I got a call. From your mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She threatened to report us, said she&#39;d have our license revoked if I didn&#39;t fire you.&#34; Benny kept staring at the floor. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I couldn&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She runs a luxury skincare company, Benny. Not the goddamn FBI.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged helplessly. &#34;She said she&#39;d report us for health code violations. And you know she&#39;s got connections. She could actually pull it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. Yelling at Benny wouldn&#39;t do anything. This wasn&#39;t his fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I did something stupid-like hurling a milk jug out the window-I stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t hate that job. Being a barista was just a side hustle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What really paid the bills-what no one knew except Yvaine-was my jewelry design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since | was a kid, my mom had told me I was average. Ordinary. Talentless. Every time I tried to shine, she dragged me back into her shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, I learned to obey. I buried my ambition,wore gray feathers like a peacock pretending to be a pigeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So no, I didn&#39;t care about losing the coffee shop job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What infuriated me wasn&#39;t unemployment. It was that this-this powNer move-was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingerprints were all over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her punishment. A response to me trying to escape Rhys. Trying to escape her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sending me a message:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You don&#39;t get to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can destroy any scrap of pride you think you&#39;ve earned-with one finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she thought I would come crawling back, like | used to,begging for her approval..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could go to hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t her puppet anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was done playing the good girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, I shoved open the front door of the Vance estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No knocking. I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had come ready to start round two of our family war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I found instead was something far worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My parents were sitting on the ivory couch in the living room,sipping wine worth more than my rent, laughing -Laughing-with a man I didn&#39;t recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene was picturesque. Like they&#39;d stepped rght out of How to Host the Perfect Suburban Power Dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked like a slimy, watered-down version of a 1950s mogul-maybe one who&#39;d spent time in white-collar prison and came out with a tailor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Custom suit. Shirt unbuttoned to mid-chest, revealing a patch of chest hair that looked like someone had just trimmed a Christmas wreath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His teeth were too white, his smile too polished-like greed dipped in varnish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling,&#34; my mother cooed, sweet as syrup,ome meet Mr. Leonard Shaw, CEO of Alcott Shipping. A true self-made man. There&#39;s so much you could learn from him-about turning raw talent into real success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit like a scented hammer to the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard grinned ear to ear. His eyes-no,his eyes went straight under my skirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lovely to meet you, Miss Vance,&#34; he said. &#34;I do hope we get to talk more. I always enjoy mentoring young women. Especially smart,beautiful ones like yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother hiding my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t disgust. It was nausea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was practically licking his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear the soundtrack of Indecent Proposal playing in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira,&#34; my mother warned in that sugar-coated threat tone, &#34;don&#39;t be rude. Shake Mr. Shaw&#39;s hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move. I didn&#39;t even blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone had thrown a raccoon at me in that moment, I&#39;d have hugged it over touching Leonard&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline&#39;s laugh rang out, high and brittle, like she was trying to cover up my resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young people are so sensitive these days, aren&#39;t they?&#34;she said to Leonard, with the practiced tone of someone saying she&#39;ll come around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard just waved it off. &#34;I like a girl with a little fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, and I like dentists who don&#39;t need pliers. We can&#39;t all get what we want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my father-the same man who, justdays ago,told me &#39;we&#39;ll take care of everything&#39;-was now nodding at Leonard like a hotel concierge hoping for a good tip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when I understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t an introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a presentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the product on display tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about meeting a &#39;promising single man.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a sale. I was being marketed like a financial package with a bonus gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Leonard finally left-leaving behind a cloud of cologne and a trail of sleaze-l turned to face them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother raised her wine glass, took a slow.triumphant sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That,&#34; she said with a smnile,&#34;was your future husband.&#34;</p>
