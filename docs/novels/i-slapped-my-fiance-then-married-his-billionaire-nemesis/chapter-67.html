                <p>Ashton watched Mirabelle flee the dining room without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his wine glass down. &#34;How&#39;s she settling in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey stepped forward. &#34;Mrs. Laurent mostly stayed in her room and worked on her sketches.She dropped by a law firm earlier today. Came back right after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stayed in? She didn&#39;t go to the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered her telling him last week about some big campaign Nyx Collective was preparing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A career-defining launch, apparently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out what&#39;s going on at Nyx,&#34; he said the second Cassian picked up. &#34;Ask Yvaine Carlisle.Don&#39;t make it obvious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian groaned. &#34;Mate, I&#39;m your bloody best man,not your PA. Nor your wife&#39;s. Why don&#39;t you just ask Mirabelle yourself? Or are you two not on speaking terms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it.&#34; Ashton hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then at his untouched plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steak tasted like cardboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine like vinegar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassian&#39;s words pissed him off more than he cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d married her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d moved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was already a win, considering how allergic she was to commitment, post-Rhys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lived in the same damn house, ate at the same table, and somehow she still looked at him like he was her boss during a performance review.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, at dinner, her smile had been a dead giveaway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same kind customer service reps gave-polite, bland, entirely devoid of meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he hadn&#39;t missed the way her eyes kept darting over him when she thought he wasn&#39;t looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over his jaw, his hands, his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know what it did to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she didn&#39;t realize her gaze had weight, like a touch he could feel without being touched, soft and slow and impossible to ignore, dragging heat across his skin wherever it landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So yeah. She was into his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least there was that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was a transient, superficial, Chippendales-level interest-she was all in for the show, front row,drooling over the abs and hip thrusts... but she&#39;d never take the dancer home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when the lights came up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when real life started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton ran a hand through his hair, annoyed with himself, with his lack of progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to be her temporary obsession, some aesthetic she played with until the next whim took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Into her thoughts, her trust, her fucking life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been accused of something serious, and her first instinct was to go it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t mention it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of asking for his help probably never even crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tight,low-simmering frustration had been riding his nerves all day, and by midnight, it hit boiling point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s bedroom was on the east side of the second floor, two doors down from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out to get water, his eyes flicked to the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light spilled from under Mirabelle&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to be on the verge of stepping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second she heard his door click open, she froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-faster than a blink-she ducked back inside and killed the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So. She&#39;d wanted to come out too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably for water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or a snack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or something less innocent, if he let himself hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second she saw him, she bolted like the idea of being near him was worse than thirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton let out a slow breath, ran a hand through his hair, and walked downstairs without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to spook her more than she already was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He filled a glass at the kitchen island,then wandered over to the living room and dropped onto the leather sofa,phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he sat, he had a perfect view of her bedroom door upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sliver of it eased open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No lights inside, just blackness and a glint of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peeked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t even look directly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door snapped shut again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sipped his water. Slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Took him ten minutes to finishit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her door opened again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned his head back against the sofa and laughed under his breath,the sound bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d rather get dehydrated than be stuck in the same space with him for five damn seconds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his phone in one hand and typed without looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[You&#39;ve dated more girls than live in half the zip codes in Skyline. How the hell do you get them to fall for you?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent it to Cassian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who took his sweet time replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mate, it&#39;s two in the fucking morning. You need meds. Or a new friend. Or a brain doc. Mirabelle&#39;s already your wife. You&#39;ve got her exactly where you wanted. What more do you want? Her heart? Soul?Here&#39;s a link to Top 10 Ways to Be a Valentine Without Being a Psycho. You&#39;re welcome. Now piss off and let me sleep.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton slammed the phone face-down into the sofa cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have known better than to ask relationship advice from a man who swapped girlfriends faster than most people changed razor blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Cassian wasn&#39;t wrong about one thing-he&#39;d already got Mirabelle exactly where he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was under his roof now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;d be plenty of chances for... further interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rinsed his glass in the kitchen sink, then made his way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of heading into his room, he stopped right behind the door and waited, a juvenile thing he&#39;d never done before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t take long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft,fast, like someone trying not to be heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to pass his room to get downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased the door open a crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirabelle was in a white slip, tiptoeing across the marble like a thief.</p>
