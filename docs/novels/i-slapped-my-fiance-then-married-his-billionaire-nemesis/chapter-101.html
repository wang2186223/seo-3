                <p>Rhys Granger was walking ahead of me, head down, flipping through a stack of papers with the hospital&#39;s logo on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his back to me, but I&#39;d have recognized that lanky frame and those slightly hunched shoulders anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right next to him was Catherine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded chipper. &#34;I told you. It&#39;s positive, right? I&#39;m definitely pregnant! The doctor confirmed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the signpost near the stairwell door. This was the obstetrics and gynecology floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet carried me forward before I&#39;d even decided to follow; I could smell drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway wasn&#39;t crowded, but it was busy enough that I could blend in, trailing after them without being noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine sounded thrilled. Rhys did not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept turning the pages as if he either didn&#39;t understand the medical jargon or just didn&#39;t want to.&#34;How the hell did this happen? | used protection every time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few heads turned at that-most people on this floor were all happy tears and heartbeat scans. Rhys was clearly not on-brand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine noticed, too. Her voice slipped into a pout. &#34;Nothing&#39;s one hundred percent. They say condoms only work, like, ninety percent of the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys folded the test results and shoved them into his coat pocket. &#34;Doc said your bleeding and cramping are concerning.Suggested a threatened miscarriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to tell whether he sounded irritated or relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He recommends admission for monitoring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine protested, &#34;I don&#39;t want to stay in the hospital. I already gave up the trip to France. I don&#39;t want to be cooped up in a sickroom for months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you want to risk losing the baby?&#34; Rhys snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this point, I&#39;d forgotten all about the garden. This was far better entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wil you stay with me?&#34; Catherine asked, her voice smaller now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1 visit when I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ll be lonely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll hire a nurse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clearly wasn&#39;t fine. Her voice dipped at the end as if hoping he&#39;d change his mind and offer to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys slowed.&#34;Cathy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you want to keep the baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice went sharp. &#34;What do you mean, &#39;if I want to keep the baby&#39;? Of course I do! l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lower your voice,&#34; Rhys hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine wasn&#39;t backing down. &#34;Doctor said if I get an abortion now, it&#39;ll make it harder for me to have children later. Is that what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys stopped, ran a hand through his hair, and let out a loud exhale.&#34;NO.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;re keeping the baby. End of discussion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took his arm and yanked him over to the admission desk, where she beamed at the nurse. &#34;Hi, we&#39;d like to check in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fished the test results out of his coat and handed them over. &#34;I&#39;d like a private room-single, preferably en suite. And TV. Wi-Fi. I hear some of your rooms offer a minibar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse smiled. &#34;Of course, miss. Our Director&#39;s Wing includes all that, plus premium bedding, daily housekeeping, a la carte room service, aromatherapy options, and personal concierge access.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine turned to Rhys, eyes gleaming. &#34;Rhys! I want the Director&#39;s Wing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys glanced at the price list. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ve never stayed in one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re pregnant, not dying. You don&#39;t need that level of care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I don&#39;t deserve that level of care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant,&#34; Rhys muttered, rubbing his temple. &#34;I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| think it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys scowled. &#34;The tickets to France, the cruises, the hotel bookings-none of it was refundable.I&#39;ve already lost close to eighty grand because you didn&#39;t want to go, and now-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t want to go! I was bleeding and cramping-how could I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned soft and wounded. &#34;I&#39;d have thought you&#39;d understand. Are you blaming me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from where I was standing-hiding behind a giant potted fern-l could hear Rhys&#39;s.exhausted sigh. He pinched the bridge of his nose. &#34;No, I&#39;m not blaming you. I&#39;m just saying-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine slid her arm further through his. &#34;The doctor said I need rest and quiet. I&#39;m only thinking about the baby. Your baby. Doesn&#39;t that matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it does,&#34; he mumbled. &#34;But I&#39;m not sure staying here is such a good idea. My parents use this hospital.Maybe we should go somewhere else. What if we run into-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started scanning the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that&#39;s when he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes bulged like he&#39;d just spotted a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Busted,&#34; I muttered, stepping out from behind the fern like I had every right to be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Catherine, who was still chatting to the nurse about the rooms, then back at me, then at her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze. Shoulders stiffened, mouth slightly ajar,tie suddenly too tight at the neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face drained. He knew I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhys, come on, they&#39;re giving us a tour of-&#34; Catherine turned mid-sentence, caught sight of me, and immediately clutched Rhys&#39;s arm tighter as if she thought | might snatch him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said it in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you spying on us?&#34; Catherine added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34;I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? What a weird coincidence.&#34; Catherine patted her still-flat stomach as if she was trying to get me to take a photo. &#34;So you just happened to be at the same hospital, on the same floor, on the same day as us,right when we came to confirm the pregnancy?&#34; She enunciated the last word slowly. &#34;Who tipped you off?Mum? No, no way she&#39;s still talking to you. Dad? l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cathy!&#34; Rhys snapped, face darkening. &#34;I thought we agreed not to tell anyone until-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged.&#34;She already knows, doesn&#39;t she? She saw us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congrats,&#34; I said flatly. &#34;I wasn&#39;t planning to eavesdrop. I just happened to pass by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys dragged a hand down his face, then yanked at his tie as if it had shrunk two sizes. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t eavesdrop like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just told you I wasn&#39;t. And this is a public corridor. If you wanted it kept secret, maybe don&#39;t broadcast your conversation at full volume. Just a thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse at the desk snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys opened his mouth for a comeback, found nothing, then blinked at me like he&#39;d only just noticed my osure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-you&#39;re a patient? What for?&#34;</p>
