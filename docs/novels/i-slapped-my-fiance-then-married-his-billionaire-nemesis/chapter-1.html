                <p>Crack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fiancé hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three minutes ago,I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment,where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire. It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted,slowly piecing reality back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you fucking insane?&#34; I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute. &#34;It was just a mug with Catherine&#39;s face on it,&#34; he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have got to be fucking kidding me.&#34; I stared at him in disbelief, my chest heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,you&#39;re the insane one!&#34; he roared. &#34;L already agreed to marry you-what more do you want?Catherine&#39;s gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trembled with anger. &#34;She was your sister!She had to leave because of you! And now you&#39;re jealous of her? You won&#39;t rest until every trace of her is erased,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bleeding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. &#34;It wasn&#39;t me. I never asked her to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter. In it,she said she&#39;d seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to &#34;let go,&#34; to &#34;let him be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame,forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my family, it was like I&#39;d been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-l should&#39;ve been grateful. Even if Rhys had stabbed me in the gut, they&#39;d still find a way to excuse it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better | did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn&#39;t protect her fragile pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The searing pain on my cheek intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation,resentment-rose in my throat,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision.I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart. Whatever shred of dignity I had left-l couldn&#39;t let it be destroyed in front of this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back.&#34;Clean it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I&#39;d heard him right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces.&#34; His voice was icy, absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to be insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face tightened, jaw clenched. &#34;You sure you want to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I said no.&#34; Mly eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me.And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer, menace radiating from him.&#34;Last chance. If you don&#39;t obey me,then we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-are over,&#34; I finished for him, cold and final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still.He hadn&#39;t expected me to actually say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was caught in that moment of confusion,I wrenched my arm free from his grip. The taste of freedom hadn&#39;t yet bloomed in my chest when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun around,without hesitation and raised my hand-smack! A resounding slap landed hard across Rhys&#39;s  handsome, arrogant face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air froze again, thick with silence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce,unprecedented satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down. He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my hand, lifted my chin,and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile.&#34;Now we&#39;re even.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I stayed even one more second, I would break down.I&#39;d rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-thud-I fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Blood surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Home.I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this.Away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of muscle and the intoxicating scent of expensive cologne I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room. He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off,wouldn&#39;t just ruin your life-he&#39;d erase your entire existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly. If thnis were a porno, the camera angle would be an absolute disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped myself back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and helplessness surged in my chest.I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently.It didn&#39;t help-but I needed to let it out. Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn&#39;t I done enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice -low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your key fell,&#34; he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. &#34;That&#39;s probably why you couldn&#39;t find it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand,my face flushing so hot it could&#39;ve lit a match. I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until my back hit the door that I realized-l hadn&#39;t even thanked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great job, Mira. You absolute idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lived across from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there&#39;s no way | wouldn&#39;t have noticed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You&#39;re seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the hell Rhys just put you through?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Absolutely not. All men are trash. Always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat,reminding myself not to be so stupid again But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently,for the stinging pain on my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang,shrill and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t igore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you&#39;re no longer our daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn&#39;t earn even a sliver of their love? And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect,precious jewel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought if I worked hard enough, my family. my fiancé-they would love me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that&#39;s never going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.</p>
