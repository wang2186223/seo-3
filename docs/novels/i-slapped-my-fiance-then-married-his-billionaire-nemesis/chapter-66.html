                <p>When I got back from Finn&#39;s office, Geoffrey greeted me with his usual calm face and a little bombshell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Laurent will be dining at home tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which meant he&#39;d probably be sleeping here tonight.Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that I was expected to do the whole wife routine in bed-thank God-but still, I was nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was being served when he walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat across from each other, all polished cutlery and polite silences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was waiting for me to say something, but I had no idea what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he asked after the first course, &#34;I heard Rhys Granger&#39;s been telling people you cheated on him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Rhys was going to get a nice little surprise in the form of a lawsuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s talking shit,&#34; I said dismissively, reaching for my wine. &#34;My lawyer&#39;s on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton dished risotto onto my plate with a serving spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did it so naturally, like he&#39;d been doing it for ages instead of for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always said Rhys Granger&#39;s unstable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re probably right.&#34; I stabbed a piece of asparagus. &#34;Well, this time, I&#39;m not letting it slide.He wants to lie, he can lie to the judge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton&#39;s lips quirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I caught it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let LGH&#39;s legal team handle ii,he said.&#34;They&#39;ve got more experience with this kind of thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped chewing and looked up slowly. &#34;Isn&#39;t that overkill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The LGH legal team handled mergers that shook stock markets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using them to drag Rhys&#39;s sorry ass through court over a defamation case felt like bringing a bazooka to a pillow fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn said the evidence is solid. He won&#39;t guarantee a win, but there&#39;s a good chance-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ashton cut me off. &#34;You&#39;re Mrs. Laurent. My company&#39;s legal team exists to protect our interests,and that nowv includes you. If Rhys thinks he can drag your name through the mud, he&#39;s picking a fight with me. LGH is getting involved whenever a Laurent&#39;s involved, that&#39;s protocol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll talk to Finn.&#34; I wasn&#39;t sure if Finn would appreciate the extra legal muscle or resent the intrusion. &#34;He&#39;s already put a lot of effort into the case, though. Can he still run point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dropped the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with it, every last scrap of conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence didn&#39;t just settle; it took up residence,moved in with a suitcase, and made itself at home between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished eating, I set my fork down and stared at my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was | supposed to wait obediently like some Victorian housewife, or just stand up and leave like this was a public restaurant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey was loitering nearby like a very polite ghost,another waiter flanking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not exactly the people | could ask about post-dinner etiquette in a situationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I racked my brain for a way to fill the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small talk was a dead end-l&#39;d already burned through the classic &#34;how was your day&#34; the moment Ashton sat down, and something told me he wouldn&#39;t be thrilled with a thirty-minute monologue on micro-pavé settings or the ethics of synthetic diamonds in haute joaillerie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something I wanted to ask, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he sleeping here tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And more pressingly-where?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carmen and Geoffrey staged a surprise boutique explosion in my room that morning, there were no men&#39;s clothes in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t mean anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Ashton had his own dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe he didn&#39;t need sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he hung upside down in a hyperbaric chamber like some Armani-wrapped bat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if I asked... would it come off wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his house, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need my permission to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I sounded like I didn&#39;t want him here, that might be rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, if I sounded too curious, would it read like an invitation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because let&#39;s be real, &#34;Are you sleeping here tonight?&#34; sounds like a question only a hotel manager could pull off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or a mistress checking her sugar daddy&#39;s schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I internally facepalmed. &#34;It&#39;s a yes or no question,dumbass,&#34; I hissed at myself. &#34;Ask it. Use your mouth. You&#39;re not twelve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a snarkier voice in my head rolled her eyes.&#34;It&#39;s Ashton Laurent. You don&#39;t casually ask him about his sleeping arrangements. If you had dinner with J. P.Morgan, you wouldn&#39;t ask if his hotel had turndown service. You&#39;d ask about interest rates. Or the future of the country&#39;s financial system.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I risked a peek across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sitting there like the ghost of European nobility, sipping wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers, long, elegant, dusted with calluses,wrapped around the glass stem with effortless control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he swallowed, his Adam&#39;s apple shifted ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the strongest, dumbest urge to lean over and lick it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look away, you thirsty gremlin,&#34; I barked at myself.&#34;Stop leering like a perv.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder people always say&#34;movie, dinner, then sex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or, in Gen Z speak, &#34;Netflix and chill,&#34; with the heavy emphasis on the &#34;chill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a rhythm to it. A build-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner after sex just felt... off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like watching the end credits first, then hitting play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d done it all backwards, jumped Ashton&#39;s bones before even learning his first name, married him after, and now here we were, eating risotto in weird,loaded silence like a couple on a first date who&#39;d already seen each other naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just...awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what the hell the next move was supposed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to wait for me,&#34; Ashton said, not looking up.&#34;You can go do your thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; I said, already halfway to the stairs.</p>
