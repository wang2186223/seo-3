                <p>Megan crossed her arms and stared at Zeta. &#34;Are you trying to read my mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta retracted its shiny metal rear and let out a creepy chuckle. &#34;I simply picked up on your emotional indicators, Goddess. Judging by the current situation,I was just showing you the smart route. Oh, and Mrs.Jones agrees too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones: [Did it have to say it out loud?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks suddenly flushed. She cleared her throat and mumbled, &#34;Uh... let&#39;s just start cooking,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the principal&#39;s office of Meridian University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man sat back in a leather chair,legs crossed with effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lazy smile, he said, &#34;I heard you&#39;re planning to renovate the library?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Principal Scott nodded, smiling. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tapped his fingers on the chair&#39;s armrest.&#34;Renovating seems unnecessary. Why don&#39;t we just build a new one-300,000 square meters-on the open land to the south? Oh, and by the way, the equipment in your science center looks pretty outdated. Better import some cutting-edge tech from abroad.&#34; Principal Scott eyed the man like he was a gold mine wrapped in a well-cut suit-but knew there was no such thing as a free lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, &#34;Mr. Reid, you&#39;re truly a patriot for the nation&#39;s education. Students across the country will remember your generosity. If Meridian University can be of any help to you in the future,you have my word -I&#39;ll do my best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, mid-tap, suddenly stopped. His eyes lifted slightly, lips curving. &#34;No need to wait for the future.I&#39;ve got something in mind right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan returned to Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he stepped through the door, Zeta came zooming in. &#34;Master&#39;s home! Master, shoes! Master,Zeta missed you so much...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot it a cold glance and swiftly bypassed it,heading straight toward the small woman whose soft smile greeted him like sunshine. He scooped her into his arms without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That eerie chuckle came again from Zeta. &#34;Master&#39;s heart rate is hitting 100 bpm. Hormones spiking.Impulses suggest a strong desire to engage in...advanced human bonding. Let&#39;s celebrate human reproduction! Zeta&#39;s gonna meet the little master soon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s forehead twitched. What the actual hell is this thing?  His narrowed eyes glinted with a warning as he said in a frosty tone, &#34;Say one more word and you&#39;re scrap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta vanished so fast it left an afterimage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan burst into laughter. &#34;Alright, everybody&#39;s hungry, right? Mrs. Jones made a feast. Let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned close to her ear, gently biting her ear lobe. &#34;I&#39;m starving. Seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blush crept down her neck, and she gave his chest a playful tap. &#34;Stop it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally let go, laced his fingers with hers, and led her to wash up before heading to the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones served their food, then quietly excused herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan piled glazed carrots atop her bone china plate until they threatened to avalanche. &#34;Indulge, my little sparrow. Those wings need more than air to soar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tapped her fork against the gilded rim.&#34;Planning to roast me like your Christmas goose?What if I swell till my diamond rings cut off circulation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her wrist, thumb brushing the pulse point.&#34;I&#39;d commission new jewels for every soft curve. But vanish again...&#34; A dangerous glint lit his eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set down her fork and cupped his handsome face.&#34;Tristan, I&#39;m not going anywhere. Ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you,&#34; he said quietly, gripping her hands.&#34;Which is why on Monday, you&#39;re going back to Meridian University for your classes. Second year.  Fashion and jewelry design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching how her eyes lit up, Tristan nodded and gave an almost apologetic smile. &#34;I mean it. I&#39;m sorry I made you take half a year off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook her head. &#34;Don&#39;t say that. If I hadn&#39;t been tricked into judging you, I would&#39;ve seen how good you&#39;ve been to me... all your care and love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you went out just now-was it for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry, I already sorted things out with the school. Just focus on your studies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Tristan.&#34; She leaned in and gave him a quick kiss at the corner of his lps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan clicked her tongue playfully. &#34;You are kinda old,you know? You&#39;re six years older than me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled her into his arms, leaned close to her ear. His breath brushed across her pale neck, warm and ticklish. &#34;As long as I&#39;m still in shape, age doesn&#39;t mean a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her chew on her lip till it turned rosy-white,he couldn&#39;t help the grin tugging at his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, Tristan headed back to the office for a last-minute meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood by the window, watching the Maybach roll out of sight before turning back into the room.  She sat at her desk, plugged in her headphones, and played the intercepted call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: &#34;What&#39;s up, babe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly: &#34;Wyatt, your grandpa&#39;s birthday is next Saturday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That b*tch will be there too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: &#34;What do you wanna do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly: &#34;Obviously get rid of the old man first, start some drama! I heard she knows the legendary hacker -if that&#39;s true, don&#39;t you think she could take down Reid Corp? Then we&#39;d swoop in and win without doing anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt: &#34;Sounds good. Tell me the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly: &#34;Okay, the plan is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan ripped off her headphones, her eyes cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, Molly had leaked a video showing &#39;Tristan&#39; injecting air into Bernard&#39;s IV at the hospital.The guy in the video looked just like Tristan-same height,same build.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had completely broken Megan. And with MMolly fanning the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d lost herself in anger and made a fatal mistake-dragging Reid Corp down with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t going to let history repeat itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smirk curled on her lips.</p>
