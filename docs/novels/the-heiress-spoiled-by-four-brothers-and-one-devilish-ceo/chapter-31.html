                <p>Seeing that furious yet barely-contained expression, Megan raised a playful brow and teased, &#34;No matter what you stuff up a pig&#39;s nose, it&#39;s still a pig!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned around, grabbed Rachel&#39;s hand, and happily skipped across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching their bright and carefree backs walk away, Molly&#39;s red lips trembled with rage. That damn woman really humiliated her right in public. She swore, today&#39;s embarrassment, she&#39;d pay it back-tenfold, no, a hundredfold!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her two friends quickly stepped up to console her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly, are you okay? Megan totally overstepped. Doesn&#39;t she get that you&#39;re still her sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! But seriously, any idea who her sugar daddy is? Could it be Mr. Reid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way. Didn&#39;t she run from the wedding? Why would Mr. Reid take her back after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, no man would let that slide. Still, Molly, do you know who she&#39;s with now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s chest heaved with fury, and she almost shattered one of her perfect porcelain veneers from clenching so hard. With a deep breath, she lowered her gaze and replied, &#34;I really don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t seen her for about six months now. Last time I bumped into her, she was throwing up non-stop. Then she came back home a few days ago, shot me dirty looks for no reason. I had no clue what I did to piss her off.She and Dad went into the study and chatted for a while, and not long after, I was told to leave the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled as she finished speaking. The two friends bought her lie completely, outrage bubbling up in their voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! She&#39;s been living off some old guy for six months? And puking? Is she pregnant?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, she&#39;s got no shame at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s even trying to mess with your relationship with your family. That woman&#39;s just evil.&#34; &#34;Can&#39;t believe she&#39;s headed to that fancy villa in Emerald Cove, while you&#39;re stuck in a two-bedroom flat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s just messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.-.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two kept rambling on in outrage, a glint of calculation flashed across Molly&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Megan didn&#39;t plan on revealing her marriage to Tristan, she&#39;d just pretend not to know either and let people keep thinking Megan snagged some sugar daddy, preferably an old one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the truth came out someday, that Megan was actually married to Tristan, so what? Women only feel envy and hate, not admiration. Once Saturday rolled around, just wait-these two wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed both of her friends&#39; hands and pressed her lips together. &#34;No matter what, she&#39;s still my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the girls wiped away her tears. &#34;Molly, you&#39;re seriously too kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>하</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan and Rachel got back to the Emerald Cove, Penelope had already laid out a feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clearly liked Megan a lot, piling food into her bowl like a doting mother-in-law.&#34;Megan, you&#39;re way too thin. Eat more, it&#39;s good for getting pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nearly choked. This wasn&#39;t dinner-it was an ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel passed her a tissue and looked over at Penelope.om, she&#39;s not even twenty yet and still in school.If she gets pregnant now, she&#39;d have to drop out, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope let out a loud laugh. &#34;Fair enough. I was just getting a bit anxious, since your brother&#39;s already twenty-six. But Megan, no pressure, okay? I won&#39;t bug you about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the meal, Megan ate like she was walking on a tightrope.After lunch, she said to Rachel, &#34;Rachel,I&#39;m heading out to grab a few personal items. You can go straight to class later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s eyes lit up, mischief all over her face. &#34;Personal items? What is it? Maid outfit? Cosplay? Whips and cuffs? Megan, you&#39;re kinda wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s mouth twitched. This girl&#39;s brain was clearly overrun with R-rated content. &#34;Since you know so much,maybe I&#39;ll get your brother to forward those suggestions to Kai.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel wasn&#39;t fazed. &#34;I&#39;d totally wear them-too bad Kai won&#39;t give me the chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was speechless. Okay, her logic really was...refreshing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said goodbye to Penelope and left the Emerald Cove. Just as she got into a cab, her phone rang. It was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had dinner yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,ate at the villa.You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just finished too. I thought I heard a car just now-did you head out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hlis tone hinted at worry, and Megan leaned into it coyly, &#34;Just took a cab to pick up some... girl stuff. You know the kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, his voice relaxed a bit.&#34;Alright, just be careful. You can drive yourself tomorrow, so you don&#39;t have to rely on cabs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Thinking about the morning, Megan felt a warmth in her chest. &#34;Hubby, thank you... for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curled slightly.&#34;My woman,doesn&#39;t deserve to be wronged. And one more thing-l got an email from Blackwing this morning. It was footage from yesterday&#39;s road cam. I&#39;ve had my team look into it, but the car&#39;s reportedly stolen. Don&#39;t worry though-we&#39;ll track down whoever&#39;s behind this in the next couple of days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had no doubt about his capability. If Tristan said he&#39;d handle it, he would. They exchanged a few more sweet nothings before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taxi driver glanced at the rearview mirror, shaking his head. Ghosts might be real these days, but trusting a pretty girl&#39;s word? That&#39;s just naïve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place she askedd to go was legit on the surface-but at street level. Underground, it was a black market.People didn&#39;t come here to shop for toiletries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the spot, Megan handed over the fare. The driver gave her a look and said kindly, &#34;This area&#39;s kinda sketchy, miss. Keep your guard up,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;Got it,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she opened the door to step out, the driver rolled the window down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little lady, don&#39;t lie to those who truly care about you. It hurts. A lie&#39;s never just one-it always leads to more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan paused,thoughtful, then nodded and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Tristan had his eyes locked on the map on his screen, watching a red dot move across it. His expression turned dark, and a chill crept into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really did go to the black market. She actually lied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t secretly installed a tiny one-millimeter tracker deep inside her phone the other night when she wasn&#39;t looking, she would&#39;ve had him completely in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was she doing there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan exhaled slowly, tamping down the irritation simmering in his chest. He leaned back in his chair,fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest-slender, steady, deceptively calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped to the ring on his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you love her, you trust her. As long as she&#39;s not running away anymore... that&#39;s enough.</p>
