                <p>Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan took off his suit jacket and hung it on the rack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled up his sleeves, revealing toned, fair forearms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dying to ask Megan why she went to the hospital-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he gently scooped her into his arms and asked softly,&#34;Scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan instantly switched modes and leaned into him, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m seriously freaking out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Nova Tech poked its head out from the side pocket of a backpack and bounced down onto the carpet. In its baby-like voice, it called out, &#34;Goddess just went stab-stab-no flinch, no blink! Blood everywhere! Liar detected~!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s forehead twitched. Seriously? This thing was totally Zeta Prime&#39;s cousin-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both loved backstabbing their owner!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova&#39;s scared~ Goddess, hughug~~&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really? Betraying her and then begging for a hug? Absolutely not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let her down and picked up the robot dog that had latched onto Megan&#39;s pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, you know when you entered your fingerprint, the bot analyzed your personality? It kinda...absorbed your vibe and emotional patterns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan squinted. Oh, so basically-this thing took after her.Seriously? That was messed up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was honest, fearless, loyal, disciplined, righteous, wise and completely above board! When did she turn into such...dog material??</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova&#39;s voice piped up again, &#34;Warning: Emotional spike detected- Goddess&#39;s about to explode! Nova is terrified! Master,requesting immediate extraction~&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It flailed its short legs, trying to scramble away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled lowly. &#34;Wanna dismantle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Megan could say anything, two drops of oil dripped onto the pale pink carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what the heck?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked down, face full of disdain. &#34;It peed itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wrinkled her nose, just as unimpressed. &#34;Too lame. Definitely nothing like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached out and gently booped her nose. &#34;Right, right, nothing like you. You&#39;re the bravest one here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gotta step out for a bit. Might be back late, don&#39;t wait up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wrapped her arms around his waist and looked up, wide-eyed. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hacker&#39;s in custody. We&#39;re nabbing the driver tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanna come with!&#34; Megan buried her head in his chest, rubbing against him like a cat. &#34;Take me with you,please? You&#39;re the best husband ever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her soft and sugary voice made him melt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, you can come. But you have to stick close to me, no wandering, and definitely no charging in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quickly planted a kiss on his cheek.&#34;Muah!&#34; After dinner, they changed into sporty outfits and baseball caps, then headed out from Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Capitol City was buzzing by 8 PM. Cars jammed the streets, neon lights lit up the skyline, and the stars were nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They parked in front of a place called Darknight Bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand in hand, they walked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They passed through a hallway filled with couples making out on either side. Up ahead was a dance floor flashing with rainbow-colored lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place reeked of smoke, booze, and sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavy bass pounded like a second heartbeat in their ears.Men and women swayed wildly to the pounding beats, trying to drown out their loneliness and emptiness on the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan wrapped his arm firmly around Megan&#39;s waist, not letting the crowd pull her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to the back exit, where two burly bodyguards stood like statues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled two tickets from his jeans pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking them, the guards stepped aside and let them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they passed the door, the air changed-deafening cheers and angry shouts filled the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stench of sweat and blood hit them like a slap, sharp and nauseating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were inside an underground fight club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two brawny men were going head-to-head in the ring, fists flying and muscles straining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan led Megan to the front-row VIP seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed her a subtly scented handkerchief. &#34;Might help with the smell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t hesitate and took it. She glanced toward the fighters. &#34;Is it that tall one?°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a crooked smile, &#34;You&#39;re underestimating him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow. Clearly, the real deal hadn&#39;t shown up yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, no rush-the bastard they were after wouldn&#39;t be slipping away tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Might as well enjoy the fight first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the ring, the slightly taller man had his arm clamped brutally around the other&#39;s neck, spitting curses through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a violent twist, the shorter man&#39;s head dropped. His body went limp like a puppet with its strings cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The victor raised both fists high, feeding off the cheers from the packed crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a soul spared a glance at the man lying motionless. Instead, angry swears poured down-he&#39;d just lost them a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four young guys came in to drag the dead fighter off the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The referee climbed in from the side steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouting into the mic, he hyped up the next round.&#34;And now for the most exciting moment tonight-let&#39;s welcome our defending champion from last month, Daniel Flynn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to where the ref pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall figure in a black robe with a hood strode toward the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed one hand on the edge, leaped up with ease, and landed smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he threw back the hood, a rough, scarred face came into view-his left cheek marked by a long gash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were fierce, like he was about to break someone in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The big guy who had just won was still putting on a bold front, but the nervous twitch at his brow gave him away. Daniel shrugged off his robe and tossed it into the crowd, setting off a frenzy among some over-the-top rich women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s oozing manliness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Built like that? Bet he&#39;s built in other ways too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just split him for the night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I call dibs! 1 want him all to myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those pecs! I&#39;m losing my mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot a glance at the drooling group of cougars and rolled her eyes hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They acted all graceful in public, but behind closed doors, they were no better than beasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d seen enough gossip online-rich women getting handsy with male models, even accidentally kiling one from overuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rich folks played way dirtier than most could imagine-anything goes if the wallet&#39;s thick enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Megan was silently judging them, the light before her dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large hand, its joints well-defined, blocked her line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned close, voice low beside her ear, &#34;Stop watching those guys. Look at me-your man&#39;s got a better body anyway.&#34;</p>
