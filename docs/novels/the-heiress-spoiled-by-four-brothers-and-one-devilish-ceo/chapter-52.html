                <p>&#34;Is that the same Megan who bailed on her engagement with Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh, don&#39;t say it like that. Out here you gotta say it was Tristan who ditched her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna Cooper and Jessica Lunnon had smoothly veered the topic away from the four Lewis brothers to focus on Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ask me, Amelia&#39;s way prettier than Megan ever was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally. I heard from my dad that six years ago, the Lewis family actually considered a marriage alliance with the Reids, didn&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that true,Amelia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia clenched her fists at the mention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, six years ago their family had really thought about tying the knot with the Reids, trying to lock something down early on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once they found out she wasn&#39;t their biological daughter, they just dropped the idea like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d held that grudge ever since. If her family had just brought up the marriage back then, that stubborn old man from the Reids wouldn&#39;t have gone and teamed up with Bernard. Megan would&#39;ve never entered the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If things wwent differently, she&#39;d be the one standing next to Tristan now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia gave a cool smile. &#34;That was just gossip.Honestly, Tristan and Megan? A perfect match, like written in the stars or something. After everything they&#39;ve been through and still ending up together?That says a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna muttered, &#34;That Megan girl probably knows some kind of magic or something. How else would she land Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica added, &#34;Exactly. Girls who let loose in bed,guys go crazy for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the speeches on stage wrapped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason walked forward and held out a gift box to Megan. &#34;Thanks for hiking the price earlier. All for a good cause, right? Take this necklace as a thank-you from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan froze mid-blink, her brain buffering like a crashed app.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows twitched ever so slightly-a reaction from the man who rarely flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s jaw dropped half an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai blinked twice, as if trying to reboot reality itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the folks who were just about to leave all froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That necklace cost 600 million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he just handed it over to a married woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has Jason completely lost it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was stunned. Getting tricked into spending 27million was one thing, but now his brother just gave away a 600 million necklace. Willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to the woman who raised the bid against him, no less!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even mad, and he still gifted ft?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Samuel reached out and touched Jason&#39;s forehead. Was he running a fever or what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud &#34;smack&#34; echoed as Jason slapped his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot him a glare, then turned back to Megan with a bright smile. &#34;Your eyes remind me of my mom&#39;s.That&#39;s why I wanted to give this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel:[Wait,what&#39;d you just say earlier?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled Megan closer by the waist and replied flatly, &#34;She doesn&#39;t need your gifts. She has me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave her a sincere look. &#34;It&#39;s from me, to MMiss Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled sweetly. &#34;Sorry, but just because my eyes look like your mom&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean I want to play mom to anybody. Appreciate the thought though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason: [When did I ever say I needed a new mom?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel:[That girl&#39;s tongue cuts sharper than a blade!]</p>
