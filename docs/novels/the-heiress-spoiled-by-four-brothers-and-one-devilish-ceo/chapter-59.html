                <p>The massive banquet hall fell into brief stillness as everyone&#39;s eyes shifted toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, not only had Tristan shown up with his wife tonight, but even Wyatt came along with a date. That was basically a public announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers quickly bubbled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, why is the second young master of the Reid family in a wheelchair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heard he got that from Mr. Reid himself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding-was it really that bad? He looks weak as hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the woman pushing the wheelchair the second daughter of the Shaw family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second daughter, my foot. She&#39;s just a foster kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real? She never said a thing about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well duh! Who&#39;d admit something like that? Being the real heiress sounds so much better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk about playing the long game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chatter wasn&#39;t loud, but it still pierced through to Molly, whose hands curled tighter in her lap. How could she not feel bitter?  If Megan hadn&#39;t spilled the beans about her background, she&#39;d still be the glorious heiress of the Shaw family now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Shaws may not be top-tier tycoons, but they&#39;re still leagues above her current nobody status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those girls who used to trip over themselves to flatter her were now just watching with thinly masked amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing she&#39;d made her move earlier and clung to Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, he wasn&#39;t even in the same league as Tristan,but the Reid family was still king in Verduria, neck-and -neck with the Lewises. As the second son, Wyatt definitely outshone most others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had finally moved closer to the stage. Wyatt picked up the gift box from his lap and gently handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,Molly,give this to Grandfather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stood up gracefully, approaching Mr. Reid with a sweet smile. &#34;Happy birthday, Grandfather. Wishing you health,happiness, and endless blessings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid had met Molly before and knew about her background, but he&#39;d never shown any sign of holding it against her for not being the Shaws&#39; biological daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted the gift and handed it off to Mr. Stewart with a light chuckle. &#34;Looks like the bond between our Reid family and the Shaws runs deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan are husband and wife, and now you and Wyatt care for each other too. That&#39;s wonderful,simply wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly turned her gaze toward Megan and Tristan,her voice soft and demure. &#34;HHi, Megan,hi, Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her timid little act, Megan really wanted to rip her fake mask off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she ever forget the cruelty, the arrogance,the sheer malice from her past life-when Molly had shattered her arms and sewn her mouth shut?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pain was etched into her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t worried, though. Molly wouldn&#39;t be able to play this game much longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt scoffed, eyes narrowing. &#34;Isn&#39;t she at least your future sister-in-law? As the elder brother and sister-in -law, don&#39;t you think basic manners are in order? Even the Reids should keep up appearances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure Tristan and Megan wouldn&#39;t stir up drama in public-after all, this was Mr. Reid&#39;s birthday, and the hall was full of influential guests. Too risky to make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he&#39;d clearly overestimated them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked inwardly. Oh, please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear,smile faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could&#39;ve sworn your legs were fine, W/yatt. But here  you are, riding that wheelchair like it&#39;s your new throne.You know what they say-strong will despite broken limbs. Or maybe you&#39;re planning to marry that wheelchair for the rest of your life? Your brain was a lost cause to begin with, and now your body&#39;s following suit. What a tragedy for the Reid family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly gave a trembling look, like she was about to cry.&#34;I know you don&#39;t like me, Megan, but do you really have to drag Wyatt down with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soft little voice and pitiful face-anyone who didn&#39;t know better might&#39;ve even&#39;felt bad for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneaked a glance at Mr. Reid, hoping to paint Megan as too aggressive, too callous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let everyone see what kind of woman Megan really was. How could someone like that ever qualify to be the lady of the Reid family,to stand beside Tristan?Just then, a crisp voice cut through the noise.&#34;Then tell us-why exactly does Megan not like you? Why do you always play the victim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly looked up toward the source of the voice-Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was strolling in with Penelope on her arm,followed closely by Lina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s gaze instinctively shifted to Penelope. Though she kept a gentle expression, there was something unmistakably judgmental and disdainful in her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly clenched her fists so tightly, her nails dug into her palms. She wanted nothing more than to rip  Rachel apart on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh, this stupid girl. Tonight you&#39;re going down,hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took a step forward and hooked a finger under Molly&#39;s chin. &#34;Go on, in front of Grandpa. Tell everyone why I don&#39;t like you. Or better yet-why you got kicked out of the Shaw family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Molly&#39;s face instantly. That helpless,poitiful look won her some sympathy from the onlookers who didn&#39;t know the full story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers started among the guests, some of them thinking Megan was being too harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope glanced around at those whispering skeptically about Megan, then smiled faintly. &#34;Megan&#39;s never one to lash out for no reason. If she doesn&#39;t care for someone, there&#39;s always a reason behind it.Honestly, I&#39;m curious what kind of &#39;misery&#39; this girl-who called herself the second Shaw daughter for years-has faced that she&#39;s bawling her eyes out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly was seething. Clearly, Rachel had gone running to Penelope about what happened at school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That backstabbing brat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, Penelope was calling her the Shaw family&#39;s adopted daughter right in front of everyone-humiliating her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when she thought things couldn&#39;t get worse,a real bomb dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe appeared, arm in arm with Diane Hartwell</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane let out a cold laugh. &#34;Our family didn&#39;t raise a daughter all these years. What we raised... was a snake.Ungrateful and scheming through and through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly just wanted the floor to swallow her whole.Everyone here was singing Megan&#39;s praises and trampling all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her plan tonight to take those two down with her, she would&#39;ve never shown up to be dragged like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, her only move was the same old play-look weak,pretend to be innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes welled up as she turned to Mr. Reid, silently begging him to speak up for her, to end this farce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But things didn&#39;t play out the way she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid trusted Megan. He knew she wasn&#39;t the type to throw accusations around, so clearly there had to be a deeper reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression turned serious, and he fixed his gaze on Molly. His voice was solemn.&#34;Then tell me-why does Megan dislike you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what happened with the Shaw family that they cast you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt was fuming inside, thinking Molly was a damned idiot. She was totally embarrassing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Grandpa wouldn&#39;t defend his owvn grandson right now-why would he stick his neck out for an outsider like her? His eyes darkened. Bringing this woman tonight was a terrible miscalculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Sophia walked up, with Pearl and Evelyn trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was dressed in a deep red long-sleeved gown.She looked elegant and poised, but up close, the thick makeup couldn&#39;t fully hide her pale complexion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dark circles ringed her eyes, and she carried herself a bit stiffly-her injuries from a past incident clearly still bothering her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well now, what is this? A birthday party turned interrogation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, but the sharp edge in her tone betrayed her displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearl and Evelyn, ever since seeing that video days ago,had known the power dynamics in the Reid family had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who dared go against Megan would get burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d even dared to hit Sophia-a &#34;stepmother&#34; in name-which meant no one was safe, not even an aunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia noticed the other two offering no support, and she understood instantly-it was every woman for herself now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beside Wyatt, she kept on her graceful smile.&#34;Megan, sweetheart, it&#39;s your grandfather&#39;s birthday... so many people here tonight. Maybe let&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
