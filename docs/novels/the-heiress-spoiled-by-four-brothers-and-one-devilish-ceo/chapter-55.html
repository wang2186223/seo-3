                <p>The congratulatory message on the big screen suddenly morphed into a string of blood-red warnings!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[If the Lees marry the Banks, they&#39;ll fall just like them.!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai&#39;s father, Logan Lee, frowned hard. He had no idea who the Banks family had crossed, but clearly, that person hit hard-and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing the risk, Logan made the call: the marriage alliance needed to be reconsidered. The press conference ended on that note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, the news exploded onto the headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan walked back into the classroom, Rachel looked like he&#39;d just watched a thriller. &#34;Megan, you just went to the bathroom and boom-Lee and Banks families call off the wedding. That&#39;s some powerful peeing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really? All because she went to the restroom, now it&#39;s her doing?(V;)...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bell rang, and Megan started packing up her stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stormed over, her eyes red, all the pride and sass she used to wear were completely gone. She  glared at Megan and asked, &#34;Was it you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her arms crossed, Megan tilted her head and smiled. &#34;Did I do something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-you told us last night to be ready for consequences!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right!&#34; Megan said brightly. &#34;I lit a black candle,grabbed a cinnamon stick, and asked the moon to hex anyone who scared me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel piped in, &#34;Works that well? I&#39;m trying that tonight too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled down Natalie&#39;s cheeks. &#34;When did I ever scare you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lifted a hand to shield her eyes. &#34;Your looks did the job. Move it, if you&#39;re not easy on the eyes, at least don&#39;t block the view.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking,she grabbed Rachel and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they were moving into the family estate that day, Megan and Rachel drove straight over after class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Rachel sat in the passenger seat,locking his gaze on her. &#34;Meg, you&#39;re kinda spooky,you know? You said they&#39;d suffer and boom, they did.Come on,fess up-where&#39;d you learn your witchcraft?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witchcraft?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three veins popped on Megan&#39;s forehead. She was no witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was straight-up competence,okay? She gave a lazy grin. &#34;Rachel, it&#39;s just dumb luck. But seriously, study hard. When you&#39;re strong, people naturally respect you. Women should have backbone and independence. Don&#39;t just hide behind a man; be someone who can walk shoulder to shoulder with the one you love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked at her like she hung the moon. He couldn&#39;t believe someone his age could say stuff this deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most rich girls were taught from birth to be perfect wives-play the piano, walk like a lady, and always stand one step behind the man. That was the norm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Megan grinned cheekily. &#34;Still, even if you dream big, Meg... trying to be someone who fights beside my brother? That&#39;s wild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot him a sideways glare. &#34;You know what,Rachel? Sounds like I should do another round of praying tonight-maybe get the Lee and Banks families back together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel instantly chickened out. &#34;Okay, okay, I take it back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the Reid estate and got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spotted Wyatt in a wheelchair with Sophia pushing him across the lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh look,&#34; Wyatt sneered, &#34;here comes my lovely sis.and that orphan girl we picked up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gave them a chilly glance, face full of disgust. &#34;Ugh, lost my appetite already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s head fell and his cheeks flushed red with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan could tell that &#34;orphan girl&#34; comment hit home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel had no blood ties to the Reid family, so deep down,he struggled with belonging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Wyatt&#39;s smug and nasty face-Megan stared at him with eyes full of venom.In her past life,that man had driven a cold, sharp military knife into her lungs over and over again. Even now, she could still feel that searing pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt. Like hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tightened her grip on Rachel&#39;s trembling hand and shot a glare at Wyatt. &#34;Wyatt, I think they put you in the wrong hospital ward. You really should be down in proctology. Clearly got issues with your mouth-you might wanna get that checked. Oh, and Aunt Sophia,since you&#39;re so full of crap, no need to bother with lunch,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched the wheelchair handles tight, face twisted. &#34;What kind of talk is that from someone younger? Dirty from start to finish! Birds of a feather -no wonder you all stick together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Criticizing her, fine. Dragging her husband into it? Not okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a low chuckle.&#34;And the moment we step in, all you&#39;ve got is trash talk-what part of that says  &#39;elder&#39; to you? Like mother like son, rotten fish and stale shrimp-you all make a great match!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, two silver-haired men walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Mr. Reid and Bruce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia immediately switched to her pitiful act.-&#34;Dad,look at this! She just walked in and humiliated me-this isn&#39;t the way things should be. According to our family rules, shouldn&#39;t she be punished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s brows drew together. Those family rules weren&#39;t a joke: disrespecting elders meant twenty cane strikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wasn&#39;t exactly built for beatings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to take the heat off, she stepped forward.&#34;It was me, not her. I spoke out of turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s lips twitched slightly in satisfaction. She didn&#39;t care who took the blame-as long as someone got punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Mr. Reid looked at Megan kindly. &#34;What do you think,Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled lightly. &#34;I don&#39;t go looking for fights, but I&#39;m not afraid to stand up for myself. Soon as we walked in,they were throwing insults. If there&#39;s punishment to be handed out, shouldn&#39;tit be the ones who started it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Rachel. &#34;If they&#39;re willing to take the punishment, then Rachel and I won&#39;t say/a word about taking ours.&#34; Mr. Reid turned to Sophia. &#34;What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gave a slight cough. &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything that bad. but still, the younger generation should respect their elders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan scoffed, &#34;So, we&#39;re playing the &#39;I&#39;m older so I&#39;m always right&#39; card now? If elders make mistakes, they just get a free pass? If that&#39;s how it works, maybe it&#39;s time to revise the family rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce burst out laughing. &#34;Geoffrey, this girl&#39;s got real main-wife energy, doesn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid nodded with approval. &#34;Indeed! Sophia,do you agree to punishment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched her chest, coughing again.&#34;Forget it.I won&#39;t argue with her anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the way she said it? Still made it sound like Megan was the one in the wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad Megan wasn&#39;t here to be walked all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face cooled instantly. &#34;Oh no, you don&#39;t get to walk away just like that. The minute we got here,Wyatt threw out that welfare orphan slander about Rachel. You think we&#39;re gonna gloss over that? Kids reflect their upbringing. And as for you, saying you suddenly lost your appetite just from seeing us, is that not picking a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Mr. Reid again. &#34;Grandpa, I really think it&#39;s time we updated those family rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &#34;What do you  suggest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Thirty cane strikes for the one who starts trouble, just like the old days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s face turned pale. &#34;Absolutely not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Mr. Reid stroked his beard thoughtfully. &#34;Sounds fair. If no one starts anything, none of this would&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled. &#34;Thanks for your support, Grandpa.Let&#39;s make it official-starting now. Aunt Sophia, after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to Mr. Reid urgently. &#34;Dad!&#34;</p>
