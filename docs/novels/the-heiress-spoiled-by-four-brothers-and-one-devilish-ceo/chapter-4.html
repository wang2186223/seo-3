                <p>Suddenly,Megan asked, &#34;What time is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones checked her watch. &#34;It&#39;s 2:20 in the afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan recalled that, in her past life, she had escaped from Dreamscape Manor around 2 o&#39;clock. Right after that, she&#39;d gotten in touch with Molly-who must be the one knocking now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Mrs. Jones. &#34;Go answer it. No matter who it is, just say I&#39;m asleep and not taking visitors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones looked at the woman who used to want to run away at all costs, now calmly staying put, and felt a deep sense of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and picked up the food tray as she went to the door, blocking the figure who tried to barge in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move. I need to see my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,Miss Shaw.Young Madam is resting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Madam ? Seriously? My sister doesn&#39;t care about such titles. What, is she hurt or something and you&#39;re all hiding it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Young Madam is really just napping, please don&#39;t make this difficult for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care! If I don&#39;t see her today, I&#39;m not leaving!&#34;&#34;Apologies, but you can&#39;t come in-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smash! A loud crash echoed through the hall as the plate hit the floor and shattered into pieces</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flung open, and Mrs. Jones was shoved aside,crashing against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lay in bed, eyes void of warmth, coldly watching the woman walk in with that familiar sultry strut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face betrayed no emotion, but inside, a storm raged.	/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman in red-she was the one who&#39;d severed her arms, sewn her lips shut, and wiped out her entire family in her previous life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she&#39;d let her go this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sis,&#34; Molly called out, rushing in with an anxious look,pretending to be worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the bed beside her, took her hand with false concern. &#34;You&#39;ve gotten so thin, what happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she didn&#39;t knowv. It was Molly who&#39;d told her to stop eating the last time she visited, and now she had the audacity to act clueless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just how blind had she been in her past life to not see that this snake had no heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pulled her hand back and adjusted her covers.&#34;Didn&#39;t you say I should starve myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes darted toward the door, nervous that someone might&#39;ve heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wretched woman-how dare she say that out loud?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her voice. &#34;Sis, I was only trying to help you get away from Tristan faster. I was just doing what you wanted, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s calm agreement, coupled with her now free hands, made Molly&#39;s lips curl up slightly, a gleam of excitement in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sis,did Tristan finally agree to let you go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nearly laughed. &#34;Nope. He&#39;s dead set on locking me up here for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face instantly tightened, her brows creasing so hard they looked like they could trap a fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in and muttered, &#34;If he&#39;s not backing down,then you&#39;ve gotta take the dramatic route-slice your wrist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slowly pushed herself up, leaning back against the headboard.She lowered her gaze, idly fiddling with her nails. &#34;I&#39;ve kinda changed my mind about leaving...Turns out, Tristan&#39;s actually been really sweet to me lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly shot a glance at the maid standing by the door.&#34;Sis, there&#39;s no need to pretend now. It&#39;s just us. If you&#39;re hurting, you can just tell me. No need to say stuff you don&#39;t mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled, covering her mouth with her hand. &#34;Yeah, I guess it&#39;s kinda not true. He did something that I couldn&#39;t stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couldn&#39;t stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, look at me-already this weak, and he still didn&#39;t give me a break in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That line hit Molly like a bolt from the blue. Her lashes trembled as she stammered, &#34;You. you two actually did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small nod, voice gentle. &#34;Didn&#39;t matter I hadn&#39;t eaten for days-he was at me every night. Like he couldn&#39;t get enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words left her lips, Megan tilted an eyebrow,watching Molly&#39;s face go through a whole theatrical cycle-from shock to envy, and then seething rage.It was like watching a comedy unfold live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Megan&#39;s smirk froze stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because right then, Tristan stood in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep.He definitely heard all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, what are you doing back so quick? Missed me already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tossed the blanket aside and hopped off the bed, running straight for him. Thanks to the croissants and cookies earlier, she had some strength back-especially after seeing him, it was like energy flooded through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face was darker than a thundercloud, clearly not in the best mood. Before she could throw herself at him, he stepped up fast and scooped her into his arms. His tone had a hint of disapproval, &#34;You shouldn&#39;t be walking around barefoot like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck,resting her head on his shoulder as she pouted, &#34;Hey,at least I&#39;m not running out here nude, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut Tristan up real quick-his cheeks flushed red in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stood up now, hands politely clasped in front of her, her voice sickly sweet. &#34;Hi, Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan straight-up ignored her, not even sparing her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently set Megan back on the bed and said coldly,&#34;From now on, unless I say otherwise, no outsiders are allowed in the Dreamscape Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot a casual glance at Molly, who was still standing there pretending she didn&#39;t get the memo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tightened her arms around Tristan&#39;s neck. &#34;Baby,I&#39;m so sleepy and drained. Can you stay and nap with me for a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan kicked off his slippers, lay down beside her,and pulled the blanket over both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan snuggled up close, and her hand sneakily popped open two buttons of his dress shirt, slipping inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was that classic case-slim in clothes, built like a  statue underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even have to look. Just by touching,she could feel the solid definition of his chest and abs.The dude clearly lived a disciplined life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me count how many abs you&#39;ve got. Last few times, I passed out before I got the chance to take a good look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gritted his teeth, fists clenched tight under the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did this woman even realize how much she was teasing him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened as he glared at Molly still lingering at the bedside. His voice was ice-cold. &#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s lips twitched, herhands subtly trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood-red nails she took so long perfecting dug deep into her palms, but she didn&#39;t seem to feel a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One. two. three... four...&#34; Megan murmured in a sultry tone,peeking up cheekily as she counted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the final straw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly, her pride shredded and heart fuming, stormed out like a defeated dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Mrs. Jones just smiled knowingly before quietly closing it behind her.</p>
