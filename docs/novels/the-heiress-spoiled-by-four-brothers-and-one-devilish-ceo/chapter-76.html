                <p>Their eyes met, and Megan&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment, his long legs closed in on her slender waist, pressing her down against his rock-hard chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to run again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phoenix eyes burned with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow, lips curling into a mocking smile. &#34;What can you possibly do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely were the words out of her mouth when a quiet click sounded-his wrist cuffs just popped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, warm hands slipped around her waist. In one swift move, everything flipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Tristan on top of her, Megan hooked a small foot behind his waist, lifting her chin defiantly &#34;So,what can you do to me? I&#39;m probably asking for it,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned in, breath warm at her neck, voice low and husky. &#34;Not asking for a beating... More like begging for something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his lips crashed onto hers, and his hand guided hers lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit her jaw playfully, whispering through gritted  teeth, &#34;This is what you get for playing with fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan groaned, &#34;Okay, okay... I regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late for regrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, wait! Shouldn&#39;t you-apologize or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already said sorry back in the lab. Now it&#39;s time to say it again... here in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan could barely breathe, &#34;You damn... mmm...jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room filled with a sweet, almost dreamy warmth.Even the breeze sneaking through the window seemed softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But far from this gentle scene, in a damp and gloomy dungeon, the air reeked of blood and rot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman huddled in the corner, hair tangled, face dirty. She&#39;d lost track of how many days she&#39;d been trapped here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No clue who had taken her or where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the tiny window above, she marked the days with sunlight and darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food came once a day-leftover scraps barely edible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A foul bucket in the corner served as her toilet. The stench made her gag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The isolation, the filth, the uncertainty-they were driving Molly insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of her wished they&#39;d just come for her already.Let her do something, anything, just don&#39;t leave her rotting here.  But she was also terrified of being summoned. Wyatt had been taken... and never returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what had become of him since that night-dead,maybe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps echoed. Her head snapped uJp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cell door clanked open. Two bulky men walked in,grabbed her roughly, and dragged her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down a long hallway they went, shadows stretching behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They threw her into a warm room, where she hit the floor hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up-and her breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man lounged on a sofa, wearing a bloody demon mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clenched into fists as she trembled, barely able to lift her head to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat with a kind of lazy elegance, eyes behind the mask cold and amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crawled forward on her knees, voice shaking.&#34;Don&#39;t kill me. I&#39;ll do whatever you want. Just let me live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she got close, the two men behind her pinned her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, rumbling chuckle came from behind the mask.His voice had that deep, magnetic pull</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly Shaw, isn&#39;t it?&#34; &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything...really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly knew her assets-curves that had bent many men to her will. She was confident they&#39;d work this time too.She swallowed hard. &#34;If you&#39;re willing, I&#39;d be more than happy to serve you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a low scoff. &#34;Thing is... I find you filthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s heart sank. She had no idea what else she had to offer-surely he wouldn&#39;t waste time keeping someone useless around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a cold sweat broke out across her forehead, the man suddenly spoke again. &#34;Do you hate Megan ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse jumped. Was he doing all this to get back at that wretched woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was the case, she was screwed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want her to suffer? To be devastated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly looked at him with wide, panicked eyes.&#34;If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll disappear. I&#39;ll crawl like a bug, never crossing her path again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man slowly stood and walked right up to her. His fox-like eyes curled with a smirk. &#34;But what if I do want that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gleam of hope instantly lit up her face. &#34;If that&#39;s what you want, I&#39;ll help you. Whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught the murderous gleam in her eyes and gave a small, satisfied nod before returning to his seat on  the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a casual wave of his hand, he said, &#34;Take Miss Shaw to rest. Make sure she&#39;s comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sent him a grateful look. Guess the enemy of her enemy really was her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she was taken away, the man slowly pulled off his mask. The sharp edge in his eyes grew darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling over a bodyguard, he said coldly, &#34;Burn the carpet. It&#39;s filthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly was led into a clean, cozy room-soft lighting,fresh sheets, a hint of lavender in the air. Her face lit up with a genuine smile for the first time in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, she ran a hot bath and soaked herself in the steaming water, scrubbing away days of grime and dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in a fluffy robe, she stared at her reflection in the mirror. Even after all that, she still looked damn charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dried her hair, then dropped into the soft bed,letting exhaustion pull her under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God knew how long she slept. But suddenly,something tickled her nose, and then-she couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping awake, heart pounding, she found the room eerily quiet, the sky dimly lit with hints of dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weird tightness pressed against her chest.Probably  just stress and worn nerves, she thought, dragging herself out of bed for a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the cup in hand, she walked over to the window -and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shook so hard the glass slipped and shattered against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught. Finally, she knew where that thick,metallic stench was coming from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down below, rows and rows of large ceramic v/ats were lined up. Inside weren&#39;t things...they were people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still alive-barely. Their eyes and noses had been cut out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their bodies had been hacked to fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole body trembled as her breathing turned frantic. She&#39;d heard stories-this had to be the stuff of living corpses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her blood ran cold. Was she... working with the devil himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stumbling to the bathroom, she nearly threw up from the horror. She didn&#39;t dare take another look-what if one of those bodies down there was Wyatt ? That could be her fate too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at her pale, shaken reflection, she made herself a vow-get out, and never come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t sleep again that night. Not even when someone knocked at the door the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile... Megan blinked awake, only to find Tristan staring straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,little troublemaker,&#34; he said lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph,&#34; she huffed and turned over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next second, his arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her bare back flush against his warm chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nipped at her ear. &#34;Still mad at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes hard enough to see her brain.</p>
