                <p>Inside the dark, understated Bentley, Tristan leaned over and buckled Megan&#39;s seatbelt for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The angle of his face shifted just enough that their lips brushed accidentally-warm breath mingled,brushing against flushed cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp, narrow eyes lifted slightly, and then,without hesitation, he caught her soft lips in a deep,lingering kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand-broad, calloused-slipped smoothly under her silk shirt hem and traced along her waistline,drawing her further into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Megan didn&#39;t realize was that just as their lips met, Jason happened to walk past the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ticked by, warm fingers wandered past her collar and brushed the soft skin of her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch to her artery snapped her back to her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head away, gasping for fresh air, her lips parting with a bit of resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re spying on me again, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nuzzled into her neck, his voice deep, &#34;I&#39;m just worried about you.&#34; Megan raised a brow. &#34;Really? The CEO of Reid Group has time to lurk around now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled lowly. &#34;Taking care of you is officially my full-time job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, his answer sounded serious, but think on it-it had way too many hidden meanings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s cheeks turned scarlet. She gave his chest a light push, &#34;Shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pinched her chin gently. &#34;Just wait till our wedding night-you&#39;ll understand what &#39;shameless&#39;really looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her lips a playful, teasing kiss. &#34;Come on, I&#39;ll drive you back to campus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm-hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slipped into traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Megan stopped at a stationery store and bought a new kraft envelope, putting her drawings inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the first teaching building of Meridian University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several students nearby caught a glimpse of Tristan helping her out and holding the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, tousling her hair lightly. &#34;I&#39;ll pick you up tonight for dinner at your mom&#39;s. I&#39;ll have Cameron drive your car back to the estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he pressed a soft kiss to her smooth forehead before heading off.  Ignoring the stares-some jealous, some admiring-Megan headed straight into the building and walked toward the teachers&#39; office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was inside. She located the enrollment teacher&#39;s desk and placed the new envelope on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just two seconds after she left, the indicator on the surveillance camera blinked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute later, the office door cracked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A graceful, curvy figure slipped in, swapped out all the drawings in the envelope, and left without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At noon, Megan and Rachel returned to Emerald Cove for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope had personally cooked up a hearty spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she dished food into their bowls, she chatted, &#34;I saw the news-can&#39;t believe Natalie still hasn&#39;t learned her lesson. Went swinging a knife around today! Clearly,her little outburst at the party wasn&#39;t enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, shaking her head. &#34;Her mom&#39;s no better -completely irrational.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that actor Jason really stepped up today. Saved Megan right there on the spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel bit into her chopsticks with a small pout.&#34;A shame,really. If my silly man hadn&#39;t dragged me off,I might&#39;ve seen it all go down! Would&#39;ve been way more exciting than the movies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope blinked. &#34;Silly man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel grinned brightly. &#34;Kai, of course.&#34; Then quickly changed the subject, &#34;But sis, kind of amazing, isn&#39;t it? Both of the Lewis brothers saved you Total fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small, dry smile. &#34;Honestly, I could&#39;ve handled it myself. Really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, so ungrateful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her chopsticks, Megan gently tapped Rachel on the head. &#34;That&#39;s called nosy mortals meddling in a goddess&#39;s business!&#34;Penelope let out a soft chuckle, then her tone turned slightly stern.&#34;Megan, don&#39;t go knocking on Rachel&#39;s head again,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel raised an eyebrow at Megan , clearly feeling a bit triumphant. Look who&#39;s got backup now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Penelope&#39;s next words totally rained on her parade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rachel&#39;s head isn&#39;t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan burst out laughing. &#34;Fair point! I wonder if Kai&#39;s IQ is dropping from hanging around her too much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel pouted. &#34;You always make fun of me, sis-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope picked up a bite of food and chewed slowly,but seemed distracted rather than tasting anything. &#34;I heard the Lees are planning to tie the knot with the Lewis family from Lindon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s smile vanished instantly. &#34;When did you find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope laid her silver chopsticks gently on the table and replied casually, &#34;Last night. Over dinner with some friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at Rachel, whose expression had clearly dimmed. &#34;Hey, don&#39;t overthink it. No matter what happens, Kai&#39;s heart is with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel let out a soft sigh through her nose. &#34;I know someone like me doesn&#39;t exactly &#39;match&#39; Kai&#39;s status...and Amelia is honestly kind of amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s heart ached a little. Rachel had lost her parents early and hadn&#39;t had it easy when it came to love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and lightly patted Rachel&#39;s slender shoulder.&#34;Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Rachel suddenly smiled, though her eyes looked a bit misty. &#34;Well, luckily Kai has a thing for girls like me who aren&#39;t so &#39;amazing,&#39;right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan:&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Penelope, and honestly? Maybe they didn&#39;t need to worry so much after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, Tristan came to pick Megan up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her frowning slightly, Tristan looked concerned.&#34;What&#39;s on your mind, Meg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told him about the Lees possibly arranging a marriage with the Lewis family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan narrowed his eyes faintly. &#34;So you&#39;re thinking  of pressuring the Lewises, make them back off like the Banks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a sigh. &#34;The Lewis family is like Reid&#39;s-one of the top corporate dynasties in the country.Making a move could stir up a lot of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, Jason and Samuel-yeah, I know helping me might&#39;ve been a bit much, but I still owe them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Grandpa&#39;s health. we&#39;re still counting on Brandon for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So no,we can&#39;t mess with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t say anything. He knew Megan wouldn&#39;t just let something slide unless she had another move coming up. So he waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough, she leaned in closer, her eyes gleaming with mischief. &#34;That&#39;s why. I&#39;m going after the Lees instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan bit back a grin and easily accepted her plan to stir things up. &#34;Want my help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised her brow with a confident smirk. &#34;I&#39;ve got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently tilted her chin with his fingers, his eyes unreadable and his smile slow and knowing. &#34;Don&#39;t be too sure. You might need me more than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re getting more full of yourself lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really? So what were you doing, kissing your own hand? Or were you about to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quickly slapped her palm over his mouth before he could say something that&#39;d make her blush to the roots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the sudden heat of his lips on her palm sent a shiver straight through her, like a jolt of electricity that hit too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly pulled her hand back, but Tristan caught it,holding it with calloused fingers that rubbed gently against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile could make someone forget how to breathe.His eyes looked like they held the stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped low, rich and tempting. &#34;Still want me to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s lashes fluttered as she swallowed. She couldn&#39;t help but say, &#34;Yeah... I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tapped the tip of her nose with a smirk. &#34;Knew it. You&#39;ve been dying to get your hands on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan:&#34;.&#34;</p>
