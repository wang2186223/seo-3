                <p>Mia&#39;s words had just left her mouth when Megan&#39;s smile completely froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had clearly told Tristan the other day-LiMo was a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt the grip on her waist tighten. That hand,warm and firm, sent a subtle warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s sharp eyes flickered briefly, then went still.His skin, usually pale and clear, now looked as cold as frost, distant and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned close to Megan&#39;s ear and murmured, &#34;So,turns out Mr. LiMo is a &#39;he&#39;, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes fluttered as she cast a sidelong glance at Mia. &#34;Babe, don&#39;t listen to her nonsense. She&#39;s just messing with you.&#34; But Mia, fully committed now, chuckled, &#34;He said you&#39;ve got real potential. He&#39;s betting you&#39;ll win tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan:[Mia,you&#39;re dead meat.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s thumb slowly slid along her waistline, his voice low enough for only her to hear, &#34;We&#39;ll settle this properly tonight, sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then let go of her, grabbed Mia&#39;s luggage,and loaded it into the trunk, driving them both to the hotel he&#39;d arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Mia kept ridiculously quiet. She knew she&#39;d overdone it and was terrified Megan would fire her if she pushed any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since models were coming soon for fittings, Tristan just dropped them at their room and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia grinned sheepishly, &#34;LiMo, I think I really messed it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave her a cold side-eye. &#34;Wow, you actually realized that?&#34;  Just then, Nova Tech poked its head out of Megan&#39;s bag. &#34;You little troublemaker! You stressed out Boss and Goddess! I&#39;m gonna tattoo your lips!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia, seeing the palm-sized Nova, didn&#39;t sense any danger-only thought it was adorable. &#34;Aww, it&#39;s so cute! And it even trashes people!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow. &#34;Um, did you not catch the part where it said it would tattoo your lips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This thing can actually do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Mia still clueless, Megan decided to clarify,&#34;Last time it did that, the guy literally looked like a clown afterwards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s smile dropped. She gulped, finally catching on that this mechanical pup was not just a toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you&#39;re not serious, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned back on the black leather sofa,crossed her arms and legs like she was front row at a good show. &#34;Nova&#39;s fully autonomous and has a high threat level.Most importantly? It never jokes around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed an orange from the fruit tray and placed it on the coffee table. &#34;Nova, give the orange a nice lip tattoo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Goddess!&#34; Nova chirped sweetly, jumped over to the orange, and extended a needle glistening with red liquid from its mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hiss sounded-and bam, a clown smile appeared right on the orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia went pale. She crouched beside Megan&#39;s legs.&#34;Lila,I was wrong,okay?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lifted her chin with a finger. &#34;Mia, thanks to your little &#39;joke,&#39; I&#39;ll be paying for it tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, isn&#39;t that what sleep is for-solving problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s expression darkened immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova added cheerfully, &#34;They don&#39;t sleep, they play the spanking game!&#34; Megan looked like she was about to explode. This mutt was absolutely selling her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia, meanwhile, was gawking. She plopped down next to Megan. &#34;Wait a sec-you two got a marriage license already, and still nothing real happened?Don&#39;t tell me... he&#39;s not up to it? Seriously? That guy&#39;s got the looks and bod, pretty sure he could break a bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slapped her hand off and shot her a glare.&#34;He&#39;s just being respectful. He&#39;s waiting for the wedding night.&#34;Mia Ford&#39;s lips twitched as she gave Megan a once-over. &#34;With curves like yours and that innocent little face, what guy wouldn&#39;t fall for you?Unless.something&#39;s wrong with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, you picking how you wanna go out?Horizontally or vertically?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia darted a nervous glance at Nova Tech, instantly covering her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech looked ready to pounce, just waiting on Megan&#39;s signal. With muffled panic, Mia mumbled behind her hand,&#34;Lila Moore, I messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech retracted its needle and plopped down on the coffee table, tilting its head. &#34;Hey hey, pretty girl,you&#39;re still using the name Lila Moore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It started auto-scanning then blurted out, &#34;Lila Moore-founder and head designer of the luxury brand LX. Gender unknown. Estimated net worth:two billion USD.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crap!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Totally forgot the dumb dog was there!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This robot never knew when to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan cut in quickly, &#34;Nova Tech, remind me again what happens to a disloyal bot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech froze mid-sentence, its four legs starting to shake. &#34;D-d-dismantled. please don&#39;t dismantle me! Nova Tech can keep secrets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned forward and lightly tapped its head &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, someone knocked on the suite door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After confirming who it was, Mia opened it to reveal three blonde, blue-eyed models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She greeted them with a hug-Zoe Leopold, Rebecca Ford,and Jane Hines-top international models who exclusively worked with Lila Moore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they didn&#39;t know Megan was Lila Moore, they walked in all high and mighty, completely ignoring her sitting onthe couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia glanced at Megan, who just gave a subtle shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe smoothed her golden hair and said with a smirk,&#34;If it weren&#39;t because of Lila Moore, no way would have ditched Fashion Week for some small-time event like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca and Jane nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t get offended. She stood up and greeted them in flawless French. &#34;Thanks for making the trip. Tonight&#39;s competition dresses are for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three were taken aback by the confident tone from someone so petite. They clearly weren&#39;t expecting much from a no-name designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing they were tough to impress, Megan gave Mia a look. Mia opened the suitcase and laid six dresses and some necklaces out on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The models were stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe walked over and picked up a soft lilac gauze gown. &#34;This is stunning. Other than Lila Moore, I can&#39;t think of anyone else who could design something this ethereal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca grabbed two dresses. &#34;Feels like her style for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane squinted at Megan, scanning her from head to toe.&#34;Wait,you didn&#39;t copy Lila Moore, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shrugged. &#34;Mia&#39;s Lila Moore&#39;s personal seamstress. You think she&#39;d let plagiarism slide?&#34; Instantly, the three models circled around Megan,showering her with compliments, saying her designs were on par with Lila Moore&#39;s, predicting she&#39;d make it to the top of the industry soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they changed into the gowns, they were surprised to find each one fit perfectly-no tailoring needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit later, Cameron arrived with a stack of takeaway boxes from Zen Grove Table-all of Megan&#39;s favorite dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane suddenly blurted out, &#34;Wait, you&#39;re the one married to Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a polite nod. &#34;That&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe snapped her fingers. &#34;So that&#39;s it! Lila Moore must&#39;ve given you the designs as a favor to Tristan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca acted like some mystery had just been cracked. &#34;Oh, I get it now-Tristan probably bought the whole design portfolio for a fortune. And even hired Lila Moore&#39;s personal seamstress for you!&#34;</p>
