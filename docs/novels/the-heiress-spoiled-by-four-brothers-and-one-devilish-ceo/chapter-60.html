                <p>&#34;What don&#39;t you want?&#34; Tristan cut her off coldly, his eyes sharp and voice colder than ice. &#34;Some people just love playing the victim to get sympathy and twist the truth.What&#39;s wrong with my girl speaking the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia knew Tristan was fiercely protective, but she still tried to use the situation to gain the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a stiff smile. &#34;After all, today&#39;s your grandfather&#39;s birthday. If the guests see our family fighting like this, it won&#39;t look good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone hasn&#39;t even married into the Reid family yet. Doesn&#39;t qualify as family,&#34; Tristan replied, his words silencing the crowd in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan et out a soft laugh and flung Molly&#39;s jaw aside.&#34;You know exactly what you&#39;ve done. Keep faking that poor-me act, and I won&#39;t hesitate to tear your mask off and show everyone who you really are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t letting Molly off the hook-she just had bigger plans that needed to go smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out her hand, palm open, and a moist wipe softly landed on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stared,shocked, watching Tristan clean up for Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Megan wiped her fingers, she casually handed the wipe to Cameron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cameron was screaming: [Am I your trash bin now?!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan: [Aren&#39;t you?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron: [Fine,guess | am.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, a tall man with deep, fox-shaped eyes was silently watching the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Oliver, the eldest son of the Lewis family from Lindon City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes, swirling the red wine in his glass with a mocking smile. &#34;So this is the one who scammed you out of 600 million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason looked at Megan admiringly and clicked his tongue. &#34;Yup. Pretty impressive,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel muttered, &#34;You don&#39;t even know, Oliver.Jason wanted to gift her that 600 million necklace, and she totally turned him down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason&#39;s grin instantly died, mood taking a nosedive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d said Megan&#39;s eyes reminded him of their mother&#39;s and wanted to give her the necklace, but she flat-out rejected it, saying she didn&#39;t want to be anyone&#39;s mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A megastar offering a sky-high luxury gift and getting shut down-total humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely one of those &#34;never speak of this again&#34;moments. &#34;But Oliver, don&#39;t you think her eyes really do look just like Mom&#39;s?&#34; Samuel added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Oliver studied her more carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he nodded slightly. Yeah. there was a resemblance. But she was still a Shaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s cool, handsome face curved into a faint smile.He was just about to head toward Megan when a petite figure blocked his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a white lace baby-doll dress, she looked as pure and delicate as a blooming white lily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Jason and Samuel. &#34;You two are both here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver gave a slight nod and walked past her toward Mr.Reid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason and Samuel didn&#39;t spare her much of a glance and quickly followed Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her brothers act so distant while they all seemed interested in Megan, Amelia felt a surge of resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with all the powerful guests and socialites around,playing nice was essential. She was supposed to be their precious little sister-Lewis family&#39;s golden girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a sweet curve onto her lips, Amelia followed behind them toward Mr. Reid.Oliver arrived just a little too late to witness Megan and Tristan&#39;s earlier moment.He couldn&#39;t help but feel a little let down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his assistant present the gift from the Lewis family. &#34;This oil painting caught my eye at the Hill Auction. I thought it would be a lovely addition to your study, sir. My mom&#39;s health hasn&#39;t been great, so she&#39;s getting treatment overseas. Dad stayed with her,and Brandon will be back around mid-month, so it&#39;s just us brothers here today for your birthday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid stroked his white beard and smiled. &#34;No problem at all. If the Lewis family ever needs anything,just have a word with Tristan. It&#39;s your generation&#39;s time to shine now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver gave a slight nod. &#34;Will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid then noticed someone behind the three brothers. &#34;Amelia&#39;s grown up into such a fine young lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia stepped forward with grace and poise, her manner polished and elegant. &#34;Happy birthday,Grandpa Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Reid asked with a chuckle, &#34;You&#39;re in college now,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m studying fashion and jewelry design at Meridian University.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the same major as our Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our Megan? That sounded way too close.  Though a twinge of jealousy stirred in her chest,Amelia kept her smile. &#34;Yes, Grandpa Reid. Megan and I aren&#39;t in the same class, but we do attend some of the bigger lectures together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid clicked his tongue thoughtfully. &#34;Now that you mention it, I think you and Megan were born on the exact same date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia froze. Same day, month, and year?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the three Lewis brothers looked stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of coincidence was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brothers exchanged glances before quickly masking the flicker of unease in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Reid suddenly clapped his hands and laughed.&#34;Oh,I&#39;m getting old! Megan&#39;s actually three days older than you-not the same day after all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia stole a glance at her brothers. Seeing no unusual reaction from them, her heart eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the Lewis family learned she wasn&#39;t their real daughter, they never stopped searching for the true one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Megan had really been born on that date. and if a DNA test confirmed she was the real daughter swapped at birth. not only would she be the rightful heir to the Lewis family, she&#39;d also married the world&#39;s richest man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be the ultimate win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gladly, Megan wasn&#39;t born on the same day.  Amelia would&#39;ve lost it if that were the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly buried her frustration and smiled sweetly.&#34;She&#39;s only a bit older than me, but I do think of her as an older sister-if that&#39;s alright with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Reid nodded with approval. &#34;I really like Megan too.If you two someday become, what do you girls call it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besties,&#34; Amelia chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, besties! That&#39;d be perfect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After offering their birthday wishes, the Lewis brothers soon left the Empire Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia found a quiet, hidden corner with a good view,secretly watching that man who looked like he belonged in a myth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, as many big shots came over to chat with Tristan, Megan teased, &#34;They&#39;re all here for Grandpa&#39;s party. You better go entertain them before people say Tristan can&#39;t resist a pretty face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as she spoke. &#34;I&#39;m gonna go find Rachel and Chloe to hang out with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned close to whisper in her ear,his fingers brushing her soft neck in a teasing way,&#34;A pretty face?I only have eyes for yours.&#34;</p>

                <p>As she watched him leave, the sparkle in her eyes faded into ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and quickly made her way to find Rachel-she had to stop Molly&#39;s plan to drug her today.</p>
