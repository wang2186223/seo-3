                <p>Megan tilted her chin at the three boys standing there like statues. &#34;You know what to say later, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two guys nodded like bobbleheads. &#34;Got it, got it. We&#39;ll say Manuel tried to attack you, tripped himself and got stabbed by accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Shaw, we really didn&#39;t mean to hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan replied softly while typing something on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the bleached-blond punk&#39;s phone chimed-he&#39;d gotten a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan walked over to the two boys and shot a glance at the one with glasses. &#34;Four-Eyes, stay at least five meters away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy freaked and scrambled ten meters away, hiding behind a big tree and peeking out nervously,like he was worried blood might start flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking up to the two boys, Megan nodded toward them. &#34;Lucky for you, it&#39;s not a capital offense. But don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting off easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a sly, almost sinister smile. Her eyes flicked down to her phone again-three new messages popped up, making her mood soar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a deep voice cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stabbed someone and you&#39;re threatening people to lie for you? That&#39;s not exactly clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s smile vanished instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, who just jumped in with that out-of-context comment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to see a tall guy-probably about six-foot-three-dressed in white sportswear, baseball cap pulled low, backpack over his shoulder, walking toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was pale, nose sharp, lips curled into a slightly mocking grin. Even with his eyes shaded by the cap,the disdain in his gaze was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a scoff.&#34;Judging things without knowing the full story? Aren&#39;t you being a bit hasty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy opened his mouth to reply, but a ping interrupted him-his phone buzzed with a new text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at her own phone, face completely calm, although inside she was practically doing cartwheels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like this dude&#39;s loaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She casually closed out of the app, leaving no trace behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy checked his phone, brows furrowing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off his cap, revealing narrow, fox-like eyes now filled with suspicion. &#34;Did you mess with something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked innocently. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer, towering over her, eyes flashing dangerously. &#34;There&#39;s a zero missing from my account.Thirty million just turned into three million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meghan:[Admit it? Yeah, no way.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a slight shake of her head. &#34;I seriously have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression chilled, but his tone suddenly shifted, softening. &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re from the Shaw family? The runaway bride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat-why did people always have to bring that up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean... look, dude, if you&#39;ve got nothing better to do, maybe don&#39;t add to the chaos here. The cops are showing up soon to take statements, and I really don&#39;t want you skewing the whole story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked like he hadn&#39;t heard a word she said. &#34;You don&#39;t think we kinda look alike? Especially the eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, the first time Megan saw him, she did feel a weird sense of familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that he mentioned it. yeah, maybe there was something there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel Lewis.Senior in Software Engineering-Computer Science track. You&#39;re a freshman, right? I outrank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced over with a teasing smile. &#34;Alright, got it.Do I call you Sam the Sham?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel:[Is she actually serious right now?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four-Eyes: [That&#39;s the one and only Fourth Young Master of the Lewis family in Lindon City.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two other boys: [Can we just leave now?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan really couldn&#39;t be more unimpressed with this cliché pick-up move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And especially when it came from Amelia&#39;s older brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had zero good feelings for that girl.Anyone buddy-buddy with Natalie? Definitely not someone she&#39;d get along with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So naturally, she threw Samuel into the same category.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel picked up on the indifference in her eyes and chuckled. &#34;Give me your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow-guess he thought she&#39;d messed with his bank account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine,let him check!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bring it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly handed the phone over.&#34;Go ahead. I don&#39;t see how a missing zero in your account&#39;s my problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed a number from her phone, and the very next moment, Samuel&#39;s own phone buzzed in his pocket. Handing her phone back, he said, &#34;That number I just called? It&#39;s mine. Feel free to save it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it wasn&#39;t about suspecting her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dude just wanted her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the two boys also started freaking out about missing money in their accounts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s face turned cold; his voice cut through like ice. &#34;Stop yelling like paranoid freaks. I misread it,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan watched his sudden shift and could smell the ulterior motives from a mile away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never left room for misread signals or flirtation drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coolly lifted her left ring finger to show off her wedding band. &#34;I&#39;m married. Get it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel blinked.&#34;Tristan Reid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lightly brushed her ring with her fingers. &#34;Use those sharp eyes of yours. You figure it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low whistle. &#34;Ain&#39;t it nice to gain a handsome friend on the side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twitched her lips, already done with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing she needed was some pretend friend. Tristan was all she ever wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, two girls walked over-none other than Natalie and Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they spotted bleached-blond punk lying in a pool of blood, they gasped in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia circled around and rushed to Samuel&#39;s side, her voice syrupy sweet. &#34;Samuel...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel stayed cold and distant.&#34;Mm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucking her dark hair behind an ear, Amelia turned to Megan. &#34;Megan, what happened here?&#34; Natalie snorted. &#34;Let me guess, Megan-this your handiwork? First, you beat someone up, now you&#39;re pulling knives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had to be one of those people who left their brain at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot her a chilly glance.&#34;You know how there are sixteen personality types?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blinked. &#34;Yeah...like INFP, ENTJ,stuff like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked.&#34;Right. You&#39;re the missing one-ID10T.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face contorted. &#34;Wait-ID10T.? Are you calling me an idiot?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan simply tilted her chin toward Natalie&#39;s hand. &#34;Forgot the pain already, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression instantly shifted, and her arrogance deflated just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia moved in with a concerned look. &#34;Did those guys try to come after you? Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan replied flatly, &#34;Nope. Thanks though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after her words dropped, Natalie suddenly gasped loud enough to turn heads, hands clamped over her mouth.</p>
