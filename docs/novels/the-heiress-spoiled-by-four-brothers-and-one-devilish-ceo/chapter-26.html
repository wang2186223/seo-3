                <p>A pink-hued room was basically made for romantic, flirty moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shut her pretty eyes slowly, lips pursed into a soft pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, watching her look that cute, felt like his blood was about to boil over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, heart pounding like crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked his face into the curve of her neck, breathing in her sweet, addictive scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he reached over to the nightstand, grabbed the remote, and clicked off all the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went pitch black. Megan&#39;s eyes flew open in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, calm voice whispered near her ear, &#34;Sleep. Just sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She literally threw herself at him and he wants to...sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stiffened. Was it her? Did she not have enough charm? Or. maybe he had a problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled lowly, hugging her rigid body close. &#34;Relax. You&#39;re still young. Let&#39;s wait until your twentieth birthday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes. &#34;Seriously? What&#39;s even the difference between tonight and two months from now?&#34;she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he really did have issues...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop overthinking. It&#39;s not about your charm. Trust me, I want to. But that day means something special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His explanation made her take a deep breath. Of course, she&#39;d been doubting his... ability. She huffed, muttering, &#34;1 know I&#39;m plenty attractive. Just look at these curves. Most guys would get a nosebleed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tapped her lightly on the backside in mock warning, &#34;If anyone else dares look, I&#39;ll gouge their eyes out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grinned mischievously. Her fingers poked at his firm chest. &#34;Hubby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one soft word melted him from the inside out. The corner of his mouth curled as he gave an approving hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next line froze him on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure you&#39;re not. you know.incapable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all the things to say to a man, that was probably top one most dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Tristan pressed her down and bit her lower lip-not gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say that again.I dare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moonlight slipped in through the crack in the curtains. Under the silver glow, Megan spotted desire burning in those deep, narrow eyes of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped. &#34;Alright, I get it. You&#39;re not just good-you&#39;re incredible. The best of the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s smile turned sly. He guided her hand along his toned body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Incapable or not... just feel for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s breath hitched. Wait. was she holding that? Oh god-was that what she thought it was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was already that hard? Holy hell. The size alone was... impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she understood that ridiculous line from Zeta Prime way too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled sharply. If things really went down. her body would probably fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey now, there&#39;s premium. and then there&#39;s you-top shelf,no contest.&#34;Her fingers twitched as she tried to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tristan leaned in, lips brushing her ear, his voice a low, dangerous murmur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You start the fire and now you want to play innocent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I wasn&#39;t- I mean-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, slow and dark, the sound sliding down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No backing out now, sweetheart. Changed the rules the moment you touched me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours later, the bathroom lights cast soft shadows over the pair standing at the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan held Megan&#39;s delicate hands under the running water, helping her clean them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was flushed pink, lips stubbornly pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mumbled under her breath, still sulky, &#34;My hands are sore.So annoying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan kissed her steaming cheek, all playful. If your hand&#39;s sore already, how are you gonna survive later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave the man in the mirror a playful glare, then flicked the water on her hands right at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sticking out her tongue, she made a goofy face and darted out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan took a quick shower, changed into fresh pajamas, and headed back to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the petite girl already asleep with her back to him, he reached out and pulled her into his arms.&#34;Good night,baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First day of school season.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting ready, Tristan kissed the sleepy girl in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mess around, still sleepy,&#34; Megan murmured, flopping over. &#34;It&#39;s your first day back. We also have to pick up Rachel and Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of those names, Megan&#39;s eyes popped open instantly. She turned her head, eyes curved in a smile. &#34;Morning,hubby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she jumped out of bed and raced to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once washed up, she rushed into the walk-in closet and picked out a white shirt, light denim jeans,and silver-gray flats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the mirror, she felt fresh and neat. No doubt, her man would like this look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shelf full of bags, she grabbed an LX limited-edition backpack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to her desk and slipped her laptop into the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Tristan was already at the door in a crisp suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his modestly dressed girl walking over, he clicked his tongue and joked, &#34;Even if you&#39;re bundled up in a down jacket, you&#39;d still outshine everyone. What do I do? Kinda wanna hide you away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wrapped her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoe to give him a peck on those thin lips.&#34;Lemme check if you&#39;ve been sneaking honey again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled. &#34;Can you taste it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;Not sure. Better double-check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned down and kissed her again, sealing her mouth with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he asked, &#34;How about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing at his annoyingly handsome face, Megan grinned, &#34;Sweet. Really sweet. Let&#39;s go, my little cupcake,time for breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arm in arm, they headed downstairs to the dining room. Mrs. Jones greeted them with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed two bowls of Greek yogurt with berries and honey on the table, then quietly stepped away. No way she was gonna third-wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan watched Megan devour her breakfast like she hadn&#39;t eaten in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, he teased, &#34;Someone&#39;s got an appetite today. Wore you out last night, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan choked mid-bite and nearly sprayed yogurt across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan!&#34; she squeaked, cheeks turning crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He burst out laughing and leaned over to wipe the corner of her mouth with a napkín.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snatched it from his hand, glaring. &#34;You are so inappropriate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised an eyebrow, amused. &#34;You didn&#39;t seem to mind when I was being inappropriate last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood up with a huff. &#34;You&#39;re impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her by the waist, pulling her in close with a grin. &#34;And yet, you still married me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swatted his chest, laughing despite herself. &#34;You&#39;re the worst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hahaha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>September 1st. First day of college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan drove Megan to school himself. They opted for a low-key Bentley and headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the Prestige Club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, Rachel and Chloe hopped into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw Megan, Chloe&#39;s eyes welled up, tears spilling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Rachel had told her everything that happened the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides feeling lucky to be alive, she was overwhelmed with gratitude toward Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Megan hadn&#39;t stepped in just in time, who knows what might&#39;ve happened to her.</p>
