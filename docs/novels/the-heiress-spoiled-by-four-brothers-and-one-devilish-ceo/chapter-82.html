                <p>Rachel couldn&#39;t hold it in and burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl with dreadlocks, often nicknamed &#34;Pirate of the Caribbean,&#34; looked beyond insulted. Twisting her face up, she snapped, &#34;Who&#39;re you calling that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel shot back, &#34;Obviously you! Who else answered if it wasn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU-!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the dreadlock girl turn red and puff up with anger, Megan raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips. &#34;If Jason had saved you yesterday, do you think you&#39;d be the one getting all the hate today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, everyone around just froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl gave a cold huff. &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter. Our idol got hurt &#39;cause of you. Ever since you came back to school, everything&#39;s gone downhill. So many people punished, so many problems- all thanks to you. Just leave Meridian University!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the chorus of insults, the dreadlock girl looked triumphant.  Then, in one slick move, she reached into a plastic bag and hurled something at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same moment, a small robot dog shot out from a side pocket of Megan&#39;s backpack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its eyes flashed blue beams, and whatever was flying at her shattered mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burnt rotten egg stink filled the air. It was awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dreadlocked girl&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;What the hell is that thing?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech chirped in a babyish voice, &#34;What the heck,I&#39;m Nova!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel went, &#34;So freaking cute!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a speechless stare. Where did the dog learn that kind of language?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pirate girl backed off a step, then yelled to the crowd,&#34;Attack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, more rotten eggs were flung toward Megan like storm clouds rolling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a tall figure stepped in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another got shoved near Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thuds echoed as eggs hit both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked up, stunned, at the figure shielding her.The guy slowly turned, egg goo dripping down his face and hair,yellow yolk, broken shells- a total mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped his face clean enough to reveal a shockingly attractive, pale face beneath alI that stink. His voice was calm and smooth, &#34;You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked. &#34;Ja-Jason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the buzzcut guy next to Rachel, also covered in egg goo, trying to figure out who he was &#34;And.you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man barely dared breathe. &#34;Just a Good Samaritan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan squinted suspiciously at him.He took off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel yelled, &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good deeds don&#39;t need credit!&#34; the dude shouted as he bolted down the campus path and disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another egg came flying from the fan crowd and smacked Jason right on the side of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to face the crowd, his voice held obvious anger. &#34;I already said on Weibo yesterday, this had nothing to do with Megan. So why are you still harassing her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dreadlock girl started crying, &#34;Jason,why are you sticking up for her?! You like her or something?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jason&#39;s agent, Julius, and a film crew including the director and actors rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone started handing out wet wipes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Director David Ford-one of the top directors in the country-took one look at Jason covered in egg mess and shouted at the fans, &#34;This is how you guys act?You&#39;re not fans, you&#39;re just haters in disguise!&#34;Jason  took a deep breath. &#34;If any one of you had been attacked yesterday, I would&#39;ve stepped in just the same. But if saving someone turns them into a new target the very next day, then what does that make me? An accomplice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started buzzing. Someone called out,&#34;Then explain why you gave her that 600 million necklace at the charity auction,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s married, isn&#39;t she? Did she seduce you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re supposed to belong to us, Jason! You can&#39;t like anyone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. Megan shoved her bag into Rachel&#39;s arms and strode right past the stink-covered Jason,heading straight for the fans opposite them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what you&#39;re mad about isn&#39;t him liking *me*,you&#39;re mad that he might like *anyone* who isn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You call yourselves loyal fans, but what you&#39;re doing is pretty much stalking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in front of the girl with braided hair,lifted a hand, and jabbed a finger against her face. Coldly,she pointed out, &#34;Forehead and nose-filled. Eyes-surgically opened. Lips injected.Jaw shaved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with brutal emphasis, she poked hard at the girl&#39;s clearly enhanced chest. &#34;And these? Totally fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not against plastic surgery, really. But you? A walking silicone doll trying to claim Jason as yours?Seriously?&#34;  Megan&#39;s voice was sharp and crystal clear. &#34;Where do you get the nerve?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl&#39;s eyes went wide, not expecting to be called out like that. Furious, she shoved a hand into a plastic bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Megan saw it coming. In an instant, she crushed the egg *through* the bag, squashing it against the girl&#39;s own hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh! My hand reeks!&#34; the girl shrieked, horror in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t flinch. She grabbed the plastic bag and flipped it over right onto the girl&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slimy, smelly egg gunk dripped down along with shards of shell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The braided girl lunged at her, screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s gaze turned like ice. Without hesitation, she kicked the girl straight in the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she retracted her foot, she calmly brushed nonexistent dust from her pants. &#34;Now, take every last egg out of your bag and smash it on your own head. Or we&#39;re not done here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl curled up on the ground, clutching her belly and wincing. &#34;Everyone, get her-she can&#39;t take us all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a short, amused snort. &#34;Nova Tech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hovering midair, Nova answered, &#34;Command received,pretty lady!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give her a bald upgrade.&#34;  Nova zipped forward, tiny blades snapping out, circling the girl&#39;s head in a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locks of braid hit the ground like falling leaves. What was left looked like a shiny melon cap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan arched an eyebrow. &#34;Anyone else wanna try their luck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova.Stand by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when a crisp *splat* echoed from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned. Some of the fans had reluctantly started breaking eggs on their own heads-slow,miserable,but obedient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked like a bunch of walking sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Megan back off. With a slight wave, she said, &#34;Let&#39;s not make this a habit, yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked up to Jason. &#34;That&#39;s payback on your behalf, Mr. Superstar. Good enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason:&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a soft laugh, his eyes flicking toward her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed something off gently, discreetly closing his hand around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And watching silently from the crowd, a pair of eyes caught that moment-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They clenched into fists. and walked away.</p>
