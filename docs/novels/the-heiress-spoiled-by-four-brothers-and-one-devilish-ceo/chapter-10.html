                <p>Just as things were about to spiral out of control,Amelia covered her mouth in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp snap of a dislocated joint sliced through the store&#39;s silence.A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s wrist hung at a weird angle midair. Her other hand let go of the hanger and clutched her injured wrist, tears streamng down her face. &#34;You vicious b*tch! First you snatched my dress, and now you went and hurt me! If you don&#39;t get on your knees, take me to the hospital, and pay for everything-including my &#39;emotional trauma&#39;-this isn&#39;t over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave that evening gown a quick glance, then grabbed the deep-V neckline and tore it apart with a loud rip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rippp!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the boutique was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tossed the shredded dress right onto Natalie&#39;s face. &#34;If you like it so much, just take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she pulled a wet wipe from her purse, calmly cleaning her hands. Afterward, she neatly stuffed the used wipe into the front of Natalie&#39;s shirt.Natalie&#39;s face turned bright red from rage and humiliation. She threw both the dress and wipe to the floor and shouted at the shop assistant,&#34;You all saw that, right? She ripped it! Cal the cops on her! She obviously can&#39;t afford it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant looked at Natalie like she&#39;d lost her mind. I mean, come on-her man is Mr. Reid, the richest man in the country and probably soon to top the world list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Megan fished out a 3VIP card from her LX purse and handed it over. &#34;Charge it to this3V card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant&#39;s eyes sparkled-it was the only 3V card in the world. Owning it meant everything was free-new releases, limited editions, exclusive collections-all with priority/access.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Receiving it with both hands, she said politely, &#34;Miss Shaw,please give us a moment while we confirm with the manager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her face streaked in tears, Natalie couldn&#39;t stop mocking. &#34;Oh please, quit pretending. Let&#39;s see how awkward you look when they find out it&#39;s fake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Less than a minute later, a woman with a heavy coat of makeup and killer curves marched over with the assistant trailing behind. She stopped in front of Megan,bowed respectfully, and held out the card.&#34;Miss Shaw, welcome. I&#39;m the manager of LX&#39;s Capitol City branch. Here is your card. You may select and take any item you like from the store, no charge,plus you get early access to future collections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded slightly and placed the card back in her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie froze, mid-sniffle, completely forgetting to cry. She blinked at the manager. &#34;Wait. Are you sure that card&#39;s not fake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager smiled politely. &#34;Sorry,miss. Miss Shaw is indeed the rightful owner of our 3V card. We kindly ask that you wait outside so Miss Shaw can enjoy our exclusive store-clearing service without disturbances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, still holding her dislocated wrist, scoffed coldly, &#34;Oh please, just some slut who slept her way up-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp male voice cut through the noise like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan walked in holding a chocolate ice cream cone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie instantly switched to her pitiful mnode,her tone syrupy sweet, &#34;Tristan, look! That&#39;s the same Megan who bailed on your engagement!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan barely glanced her way, his brows furrowing like he&#39;d just seen something repulsive. He stepped aside without hesitation and walked straight to Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered the ice cream to her lips, softening his expression, &#34;See if you like it. Got it from Godiva.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took a small bite, her smile warm and sweet. Mm, delicious. Thanks, hubby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;hubby&#34; nearly made his heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else was just as shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan then turned to glare at Natalie, cold as frost.&#34;Apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes teared up again as she tried her best to look pitiful. &#34;Tristan, l-it wasn&#39;t me! She took my dress and then attacked me!&#34;Tristan narrowed his sharp eyes slightly, scanning the scene. Yeah, his girl hadn&#39;t lost out at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly, he felt a tug on his arm. Turning his head, he found her clinging to him, holding an ice cream in one hand, moping adorably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, I&#39;m scared,&#34; Megan pouted. &#34;I saw that dress first, but that green-haired one insisted she spotted it before me, even tried to hit me. I just raised my hand,and whoosh-her wrist&#39;s like that now. And she even called you my benefactor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scared? And green hair?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What,was she colorblind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie: &#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia:&#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else: &#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze grew darker. &#34;Green hair? Seriously?Your wrist popped just from that? How much force did you use trying to hit my girl?&#34;  His voice turned icy, &#34;Say sorry, or your entire Banks family can pack up and leave Capitol City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d seen Natalie before-second daughter of the Banks family, pampered and bratty all her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit down on her lip, holding back tears, putting on the biggest victim act she could manage. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Miss Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan corrected her coolly, &#34;Say Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her pride, Natalie forced it out, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy now?&#34; he asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan licked her ice cream contentedly and smiled,&#34;Yep. Who knew some trash bins could smell so...fragrant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the store manager, &#34;Pack up everything I picked, thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan pulled out his wallet, ready to flash his black card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stopped him with a laugh, &#34;Babe, I&#39;m an LX 3V premium member. Everything&#39;s on the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan blinked. Then, with a thoughtful look, slid the card back. His smile was faint, but his eyes lingered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the ten shopping bags and added the ones from the couch, then slung an arm around her waist as they walked out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stomped her foot in frustration. &#34;Amelia! Look  at my wrist, I swear it&#39;s broken! That Megan witch totally humiliated me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed, &#34;I&#39;ve always thought you and Tristan would be perfect together. Why did the Shaw family beat us to it? I mean, your Lewis family is way more powerful than theirs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia looked at the couple&#39;s retreating backs, then turned to Natalie, &#34;You should take this as a lesson.Loose lips sink ships. Let&#39;s go, I&#39;ll take you to a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the store cleared out, four salesgirls huddled around the manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Manager,who is that girl from the Shaw family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does she have the only 3V card in the world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she even called Mr. Reid her husband! Didn&#39;t she bail on her engagement party before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, the girl shops here for free.How&#39;s that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager threw them a cold glance, lip curling with a touch of sarcasm, &#34;Even if the Shaw family isn&#39;t quite at the Reid family&#39;s level, they&#39;re still a big deal in Capitol City. That card? It&#39;s said to be personally made by Lila Moore herself, the designer and founder of LX. Gifted only because she&#39;s close friends with Mrs.Reid. You attract what you are. So instead of being jealous, maybe work on yourselves. There&#39;s a reason Mrs. Reid can keep someone like Mr. Reid loyal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car.  Tristan glanced at the girl still nibbling on chocolate ice cream. &#34;Say &#39;honey&#39; again. I wanna hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted slightly, &#34;Nope. I&#39;ll say it tomorrow after we get our certificate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really wanna hear it. Sayit, and I&#39;ll literally give you my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were full of longing, and Megan melted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lit up like stars. With a chuckle, he asked,&#34;Babe,is the ice cream good?&#34; A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweet,&#34; she giggled, handing it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t buy it.&#34; Tristan&#39;s lips curved into a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next second, he gently cradled the back of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,his lips found hers.</p>
