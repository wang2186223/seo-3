                <p>Mia scratched his head. &#34;You guys got it all wrong.That&#39;s not how it happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three models didn&#39;t even bother to hide their suspicion-there was blatant doubt in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Copying or buying out a design? That was basically the cardinal sin in the design world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And clearly, in their minds, Megan had already been judged guilty of one of the two, no questions asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Nova Tech suddenly bounced forward.&#34;Ma déesse, c&#39;est Lila Moore. Taisez-vous, les trolls moches.!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The perfect French rolling out of a robot dog&#39;s mouth-yeah,that kinda froze the girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane pointed a shaky finger at Nova Tech. &#34;Did it... just call us ugly trolls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rebecca and Zoe looked like they&#39;d just been struck by lightning. &#34;Wait. You&#39;re Lila Moore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s whole forehead twitched as she shot Nova Tech a death glare.Traitor trash bot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three models were now buzzing nonstop like a bunch of overexcited fans-turns out the designer they had worshipped from afar was just a teenager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of Megan&#39;s afternoon pretty much went down the drain-they were way too hyped and wouldn&#39;t stop orbiting around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to stress about a thousand times: under no circumstance were they allowed to expose her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they didn&#39;t really get her reasoning, all three swore to keep their mouths shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The competition venue was at the Capital Expo Center, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. At exactly 6 p.m., there was a knock on the hotel room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Jane, Rebecca, Zoe, and Mlia saw the man standing at the door in a dark navy suit, they just... froze. Not even blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy, though? Didn&#39;t spare them a glance. His eyes were laser-focused on Megan and Megan only.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fair skin, high nose, those sharp phoenix eyes-Tristan didn&#39;t just look good. He radiated quiet power and class without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>World&#39;s youngest billionaire, devastatingly attractive-honestly, no girl out there wouldn&#39;t fall hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron shook his head. The way Tristan carried himself-it was like walking, breathing royalty. Dude was unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But somehow, this walking god was totally wipped for a pint-sized drama queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Megan was gorgeous. But the world&#39;s full of pretty faces. What deadly magic did she cast on this  man to win himn over?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cameron, take them to the car.My wife needs to get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron gave a nod.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured politely. &#34;Ladies, if you&#39;ll follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Room door clicked shut. Tristan curved his lips into a faint smile and walked straight toward the girl he hadn&#39;t seen since this afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scooped her up without warning, stole a kiss from those strawberry lips, and murmured, &#34;Missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s porcelain-like cheeks flushed instantly.Her hands pressed weakly against his chest. &#34;Hey, come on. Time to get ready. I have to do some quick makeup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled, didn&#39;t tease further, and let her head to the vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Megan reached for a sexy red lipstick, Tristan suddenly snatched it away. &#34;I&#39;ll do it. Close your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going with the Tristan Style?&#34; Megan raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Megan tilted her head up and closed her eyes like a queen granting permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping his gaze on her delicate face, Tristan dipped his pinkie into the lipstick, then gently applied it over her perfectly-shaped lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was a little surprised. Wasn&#39;t he usually the one to wear it himself, then kiss it onto her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her confused look, Tristan smirked slightly finger tracing her now-bright lips. Then he tilted her chin and kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally pulled away, he glanced at her now-faded tint and smiled. &#34;This shade-that blend-it suits you better.&#34;Megan knew exactly what was going through his mind-that color was just too tempting. What a scheming big dog he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan handed her a beautifully wrapped box. &#34;Take a look. See if you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened it, and the moment her eyes caught sight of the dress, her gaze darkened. It was the starry night gown she&#39;d designed six months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress was mostly black, with shimmering threads stitched to look like drifting galaxies, dusted faintly with pearl shimmer. Under low light, it gave off a soft, ghostly glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a radiant stream winding through the night sky-absolutely breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one in the whole world, and she never guessed Tristan would be the one who bought it back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This dress is stunning, but it&#39;s a design from half a year ago. If you&#39;re not feeling it, I&#39;ll have Cameron bring you another one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, Megan loved the dress too much to part with it. But then a mysterious buyer threw out a ridiculously high bid, and eventually, she let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined it would come back to her hands like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poked his solid chest playfully. &#34;Tell me, who were you planning to give it to when you bought it six months ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned in, the bridge of his nose brushing lightly against hers. His tone was low, teasing.&#34;You&#39;ve lived in my heart for years-who else could it have been for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held back a laugh, lips curling up. Tossing the gown onto the bed, she wrapped her arms around his neck. &#34;Babe, be real with me-was I the lead in your very first *ahem* dream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question totally caught Tristan off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, then played it cool. &#34;Never had that kind of dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rose on tiptoes, a mischievous smile dancing on her face as she kissed him softly. &#34;Seriously? Not even once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint flush crept onto Tristan&#39;s pale cheeks, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing hard. &#34;Megan, it&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly she hopped up, catching him off-guard-he instinctively caught her by the hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertip traced his sharp jawline, then paused at the bump of his throat, where she gave the skin a teasing bite. &#34;So, really not even once? HMM?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tiny &#34;hmm&#34; hit him like a spark to dry tinder,igniting something deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move,&#34; he muttered, voice low and strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, light and wicked. &#34;Oh, I&#39;m moving-maybe next time don&#39;t lie to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still wanna make that competition on time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She locked her legs tighter around him. &#34;Tell me first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vein pulsed on Tristan&#39;s temple from holding himself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard. &#34;Fine. Yes. It was you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied,Megan hopped down and let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With zero hesitation, she started unbuttoning her shirt and peeled off her jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lace over her curves left little to the imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped close, arms slipping around his waist.&#34;Tristan, do I look hot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rasped against her ear, &#34;Megan, you&#39;re playing with fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pouted. &#34;But I faiI every time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a heartbeat, he yanked her in hard, his lips finding the curve of her neck. His kisses were slow, hot,sending shockwaves of sensation through every nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he caught her lips in a kiss she could barely breathe through. &#34;You&#39;re a real little minx, you know that?&#34; He toppled them onto the bed, calloused hands trailing down her leg in deliberate strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time...you win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, his burning kiss crushed against hers, sending her heart into overdrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged off his jacket, leaned down, and devoured her lips like a man starved.</p>
