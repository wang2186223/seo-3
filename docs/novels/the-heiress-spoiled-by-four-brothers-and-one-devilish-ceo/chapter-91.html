                <p>The packed auditorium was dead silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dust particles swirled under the stage lights like they had a life of their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye was fixed on Amelia, waiting for her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat clung to her back, and her face was the picture of innocence and grievance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected that Megan , that spiteful woman, would actually bring someone from Lila Moore here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lila Moore had always kept a low profile-nobody even knew if they were a man or woman,or how old they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tonight, both Lila Moore&#39;s exclusive tailor and the designated model were present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she claimed to know Lila Moore, what if they started asking her specific stuff? How the hell was she gonna talk her way out of that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hesitating for a while, she forced a stiff smile.&#34;That sketchpaper? It was given to me by Molly a while ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold chuckle slipped from Megan&#39;s lips. She had to admit-this woman was slippery, even dragging in a missing person as a human shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older woman in pearls snorted. &#34;So what else can you say now? You totally stole it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of the room, Rachel abruptly stood up. &#34;These sketches are definitely Megan&#39;s! Do you have no shame,Amelia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Kai reached up and rubbed his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d purposely sat low-key in a back corner,hoping to steer clear of the press.  The last thing they needed was reporters swarming around Kai with questions about the Lee and Lewis families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially now, with talks of a potential Lewis-Lee alliance.Wherever he went, reporters latched on like leeches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, now Rachel had totally blown their cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s lashes trembled. &#34;Rachel, I know you&#39;re bitter about the alliance between our families, and I get that. But that doesn&#39;t give you the right to twist the facts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked like he was about to storm the stage and tear off her act right then and there-but Kai caught him just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the huge LED screen flickered to life,rolling a clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia sat across from a woman in sunglasses and a black dress, chatting animatedly at a café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it cut to Megan walking into a professor&#39;s office with a manila envelope. She set it down and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cut again-to the tall, graceful lady in the black dress sneaking in, switching the sketches inside the envelope, and slipping back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next shot: the same woman in a quiet alley,handing that envelope over to Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd gasped and shouted a familiar name-Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at Tristan in the audience. He met her gaze with a faint smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Got it. So this was his doing-that footage had come from one of his people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what surprised her was that he hadn&#39;t told her Molly had reappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that mean he&#39;d already found Molly and Wyatt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whoever took them-was that mystery about to unravel too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, one thing at a time. First, she needed to shut down this plagiarism drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head, she smiled at Amelia. &#34;So what Molly gave you wasn&#39;t just &#39;paper,&#39; huh? You mean the whole damn sketch, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s face was streaked with tears, the picture of pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She choked on her sobs, but whatever she tried to say now just came off weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands gripped the fabric of her dress so tight that she&#39;d wrinkled it. &#34;These sketches are really mine. I don&#39;t know how they faked that video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words, she was claiming the footage was doctored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people just wouldn&#39;t admit the truth till it kicked them in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s gaze swept over the models wearing Amelia&#39;s designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned back to the judges. &#34;Could you  three please come up? I believe experienced eyes know the difference between real beauty and a bad knockoff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three judges exchanged looks, then stepped up to the runway to examine the gowns-comparing what Amelia&#39;s models wore with the ones presented by Megan&#39;s team.lt didn&#39;t take long for the verdict.Elena stood center stage, mic in hand, and announced, &#34;Megan&#39;s dress is finely crafted with neat stitching. In contrast, Amelia&#39;s design may look similar at first glance, but it&#39;s clearly rushed-sloppy work overall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia shot a look toward Mia Ford in the crowd and retorted, &#34;Everyone knows Mia is the exclusive seamstress for Lila Moore. Her craftsmanship is unmatched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clearly throwing shade, hinting that Megan hadn&#39;t made the dress herself-implying someone else did it for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t totally wrong. Megan handled the design, but Mia took care of the actual production. Megan turned slightly, eyes on Amelia. &#34;There&#39;s a sketch of a pendant in the paper bag too. Did you make that pendant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia forced herself to nod, signaling the chubby girl beside her to bring up a small gift box. Inside was a pale green spherical pendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Amelia first saw the sketch, she thought it looked average, nothing special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once she realized it was made from diamond-grade glass meteorite, alarms went off. This stuff forms when certain meteorites melt during their descent and then cool into glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s often mistaken for obsidian and is also called Leigong Ink. While the black variety is common,pale green ones are super rare-and worth a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have time to search for real material, so she had someone use jade instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked over at Mia.&#34;The pendant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia walked up the stage and opened a black velvet  box in her hands. A light green, crystal-clear pendant lay inside, glinting beautifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked it up, holding it between her fingers as she explained, &#34;This is a gem-grade glass meteorite from outer space. It&#39;s flawless, high-purity, no cracks, densely packed with microbubbles. The piece is stunning-partially transparent like glass,sparkling under the light. It&#39;s top-tier for both meteorite collectors and gemstone lovers. The value&#39;s beyond estimation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three judges were clearly stunned. They knew how rare and valuable these meteorites were,especially in such pristine condition. All of them leaned in, eager for a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan then glanced at Amelia, her tone casual yet sharp. &#34;You ever heard of the phrase &#39;trying too hard to copy and still failing&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby girl suddenly jumped forward, accusing Megan, &#34;You say the sketches are yours-who&#39;s to say they&#39;re not actually Lila Moore&#39;s? Maybe you just bought them off her! She gave you her seamstress  and model after all. Bet you just threw money around to get your way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s chest heaved in anger-she&#39;d had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed straight at the girl, voice firm. &#34;That&#39;s slander, plain and simple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby girl ran over to Jason, pleading, &#34;Jason,help out Amelia, would you? She&#39;s clearly being picked on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason frowned, his tone ice-cold. &#34;Is she being picked on, or doing the bullying herself? She knows the truth better than anyone. The day I got hurt,I happened to see Megan&#39;s original sketches. They were amazing-burned right into my memory. And somehow, they ended up as Amelia&#39;s work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished, not just the chubby girl-all of them in the room froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this a public betrayal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia was completely blindsided. Jason had seen those sketches? And why would he expose her like this in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She may not have been a true Lewis by blood, but she&#39;d called him &#34;brother&#34; for years. Why? How come everyone stood by Megan&#39;s side? What did she do wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unwilling to back down, the chubby girl huffed,&#34;Doesn&#39;t mean Megan drew them either. Money talks, right? Lila Moore could&#39;ve been paid off for all we know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a high-pitched mechanical voice rang out.A tiny robot dog with wings started circling above the crowd.</p>
