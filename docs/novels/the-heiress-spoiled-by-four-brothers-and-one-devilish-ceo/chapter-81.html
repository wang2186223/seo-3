                <p>Under the pitch-black night sky, the crashing waves mirrored the reflection of the moon,restlessly swirling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passenger ferry docked at the pier cast out a blinding orange light. Most people would instinctively raise a hand to shield their eyes,but the woman in a black dress looked thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to step onto the ferry, two men in black suits suddenly closed in and restrained her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even get a chance to struggle before being shoved into a van with blacked-out windows and fake plates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she got in, someone yanked off her mask and roughly jammed a black hood over her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an hour and a half, the van pulled up at some mysterious house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pushed into a room, stumbled, and fell hard to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the lock click behind her, she quickly pushed herself upright and tore off the hood. Seeing the same room she&#39;d left just this morning, she lost it and screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she&#39;d followed the masked man&#39;s instructions perfectly and evaded his eyes-thought she had a real shot at getting away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, she thought wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now escape seemed next to impossible. She clenched her jaw, face full of anger and despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the window, it was pitch dark. But in her mind still flashed the terrifying scene from earlier-it haunted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up, stumbled to the window, and yanked the curtains shut with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back around, she dragged herself toward the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot liquid suddenly started dripping from her nose.She wiped at it-it was blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, the world started spinning. Her hand flew to her chest. The pain was awful,like steel needles stabbing straight into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was terrified. What the hell was happening to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely keeping herself together, she crawled onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time dragged. It felt like forever before the ache finally started to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fished it out from her dress pocket. The phone had been handed to her earlier that day by one of the masked man&#39;s bodyguards. Just for &#34;convenient updates,&#34; he&#39;d said. An unknown number popped up on the screen, way too long to be local. She hesitated and picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly, got guts, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice made her scalp prickle. It was him-the masked man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded casual, but every word dripped with threat and venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled, &#34;S-Sir, I think there&#39;s been a misunderstanding...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t let her finish. &#34;Nosebleed? Feeling that stab in your chest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flew open, panicked. So it was him. He did something to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up, &#34;Please. I don&#39;t wanna die. Just let me go...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what you&#39;re told. Or else...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly felt like someone had their hand wrapped around her throat. One push, and she was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears mixed with bloody spit slid down her mouth and into her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it. Whatever you need me to do... I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Saturday night, after the match ends,you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighty-eighth floor,Reid Group Tower-CEO&#39;s Office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s sharp features looked unusually tense. He narrowed his eyes slightly, flipping through a few photos on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in the photos wore a black dress, big shades, and a mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pictures had been taken by the bodyguards he&#39;d secretly dispatched to keep Megan safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the acid attack by Nancy, mother of Natalie, the next day Tristan had ordered full covert protection for Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His instructions were clear-never act rashly, don&#39;t expose yourselves. But if it came down to it, anyone who attacked was fair game. A kill shot was authorized,and he&#39;d take full responsibility for all consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, when Natalie came after Megan with a military-grade dagger, the guards had turned icy with tension, fingers tightening around their semi-autos in the bushes, ready to open fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the scene was crowded and the riskof hitting innocents was high, their top priority was protecting Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to everyone&#39;s surprise, Megan&#39;s reaction was lightning quick. Even more unexpectedly, Jason had stepped in to help her out.The drama got defused pretty quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Megan accompanied Jason to the hospital, the bodyguard was just about to leave when something caught his eye-a woman in a black dress went to find Amelia. Something about the woman&#39;s figure made him do a double take-she looked a lot like the missing Molly He quickly snapped a few pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Molly noticed someone might be tailing her,the bodyguard didn&#39;t act rashly, just kept a safe distance so as not to tip her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the solid mahogany desk, Cameron lowered his head slightly. &#34;Sir, their counter-tracking skills are top-notch. We completely lost them yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tapped his fingers on the desk rhythmically,each sound echoing in the tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he lifted his eyes, tinged with irritation. &#34;Not surprising. Even if we had kept up,they wouldn&#39;t have let us walk away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, should we tell the madam about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers stopped. &#34;No need. Just tighten security around the Shaw family. Focus on the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Cameron bowed out and closed the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan walked to the massive floor-to-ceiling window,his long strides steady. Outside, the smoggy skyline of the capital city blurredthe outlines of towering buildings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared into the distance,though his gaze showed no focus. Molly had resurfaced after both she and Wyatt were abducted. So-where&#39;s Wyatt?  Was Wyatt running his own scheme, trying to dodge the law? Or was there someone else pulling the strings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if there was someone else, who the hell could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mastermind lurking in the shadows was just like the thick smog-stifling, vague, full of mystery. But sooner or later, sunlight would pierce through and wipe out the darkness at its core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel stepped out of the car,heading toward the main academic building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when a shuffle of footsteps buzzed behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned around instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than thirty girls were marching toward them,clearly not in a friendly mood. Each one carried a black plastic bag-and whatever was inside didn&#39;t look pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel immediately got alert and nudged Megan&#39;s arm.&#34;Megan, I&#39;m getting the feeling this squad&#39;s here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling? No need for guesswork. They&#39;re definitely here for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel swallowed hard. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me... they&#39;re carrying acid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes turned icy as she ran her tongue across the inside of her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked Rachel behind her for protection, though Rachel stubbornly moved back up beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared a smirk, bracing themselves for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group stopped about five meters away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the pack was a girl with heavy smoky eye makeup and dreadlocks, rocking a full-on punk outfit.She strutted forward with her chin high. &#34;Thanks to you,Jason got hurt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel instantly got it-fans of Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel laughed sarcastically. &#34;He was helping someone, acting out of decency. It&#39;s even on his official site. You guys are the ones being ridiculous now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puunk girl spat on the ground. &#34;So what if you&#39;ve got Tristan behind you? We&#39;re not scared of his name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the group started shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s already married and still throwing herself at Jason-classic homewrecker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks likea vixen, probably using cheap tricks on every guy she meets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll make sure she learns her lesson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. &#34;Hey,you there-the wannabe Pirate of the Caribbean.&#34;</p>
