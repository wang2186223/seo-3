            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The car came to a smooth stop in front of the main building. Megan and Rachel stepped out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Meridian University, students might confuse Einstein with Edison,but no one could fail to recognize Megan.She was basically the plus-one of Tristan by now,and that came with serious street cred. No one dared cross her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People actually made detours just to avoid walking too close, like they were afraid they&#39;d somehow offend her just by existing-like breathing near her could get them KO&#39;d.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the classroom and, like clockwork,Rachel tugged Megan toward the back row and plopped down next to her, already grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That back-of-the-room view... truly the underrated art of admiring hairstyles,&#34; she joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave her a helpless look. Trust Rachel to turn slacking into something artsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when a high-pitched, over-the-top laugh echoed through the room like someone had set off a ringtone from hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enter stage left: Natalie and Amelia. The second Natalie spotted the two in the back row,her mocking laugh came to a screeching halt-as if destiny itself had just yanked her pause button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face stiffened, and her eyes were practically laser beams of venom. If looks could kill, Megan and Rachel would&#39;ve been toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Amelia sat midway down the room. Natalie pulled out a bottle of firetruck-red nail polish and started brushing it on like it was war paint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother lowering her voice either. While carefully applying the polish, she launched into drama -queen mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some people really have no shame. Getting cozy with someone who&#39;s already taken? That&#39;s gnawing on leftovers, plain and simple,&#34; she sneered. &#34;Birds of a feather,huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s fists clenched at her side, her face going red from anger. She didn&#39;t need subtitles to know Natalie was taking shots at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, on the other hand, just coolly reached into her bag and pulled out a robotic dog. Holding it uplike a prized accessory, she pointed toward the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova, do you see that girl with the neon green hair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova&#39;s mechanical head tilted as it followed Megan&#39;s finger. Except... that &#34;green&#34; hair was clearly purple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nova, being a crowd-pleaser, nodded anyway.&#34;Nova sees it! It&#39;s ridiculously green!&#34;  Rachel choked on her laughter. Was this robot colorblind or just shady?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is... is that for real?&#34; she whispered, eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a perfectly arched brow and smirked.&#34;Gift from my honey. Green with envy yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she leaned down and whispered to Nova,&#34;I think that green mess would make a great doggie toilet.You know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova gave a pretend shake-no real fur, just dramatic flair. Then with a mighty leap, it shouted, &#34;Doggo taking off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The robotic pup nosedived straight onto Natalie&#39;s perfectly styled hair and began an intense doggy paddle routine. To finish it off, it &#34;accidentally&#34;dripped two thick blobs of motor oil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie freaked out instantly-nail brush hit the floor,the polish spilled, and she almost fell over her own desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT IS THAT?! Somebody help!&#34; she screamed,swatting at the dog like she was in a horror movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova zipped back to Megan&#39;s side and dramatically trembled. &#34;Nova scared! That monster was too ugly to process! Hold me, Goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s jaw practically hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked like she&#39;d just been attacked by a glitter bomb. Her hair was a disaster, her face and hands smeared red from the polish.She spun around, eyebrows twitching, and shot daggers at Megan and Rachel. &#34;You two are way outta line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan casually tucked Nova back into her bag, her smile sweet and eyes glinting. &#34;What can I say? You were polluting the air with your garbage talk-l did everyone a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie jabbed a painted finger her way.&#34;Think being Tristan&#39;s woman makes you queen of the world?People aren&#39;t blind, you know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heh.&#34; Megan scoffed, lips curled with disdain.&#34;lf |actually did whatever | wanted, you&#39;d be six feet under-with daisies growing on your face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned lazily against her chair, arms crossed casually. &#34;Cut the crap about who&#39;s the homewrecker.You two just wrecked a perfectly good couple for fun.Women like you? Doesn&#39;t matter who you marry-your man&#39;s gonna have a &#39;main&#39; at home and side chicks everywhere. Also, that neon green hair? Real on-theme choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stomped her foot in frustration, too mad to get a single word out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the teacher walked in. Natalie ground her teeth, breathing heavily like she was about to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw a glance at Amelia beside her. &#34;Ugh...Amelia, help me fix my hair.&#34; Amelia let out a gentle sigh, then reached over to smooth Natalie&#39;s hair a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the entire class, Rachel was practically starry-eyed watching Megan. Girl&#39;s got a mouth sharper than broken glass, and honestly? She loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end of class, the teacher adjusted his glasses and addressed the room. &#34;Hold on before leaving,everyone. There&#39;s an upcoming national fashion and jewelry design competition this September. First prize gets to work with the national heartthrob Jason, and the winning outfit will appear in his next movie. Don&#39;t miss your shot to meet a legend up close!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement instantly got the class buzzing with excitement-everyone except Megan and Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel leaned over. &#34;You in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a little shrug. &#34;Meh, not really. Taken woman and all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started packing her stuff, casually heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tch, what else would we expect?&#34; Natalie sneered.&#34;One&#39;s a transfer, the other took a gap year. No wonder they&#39;re too chicken to join. Honestly, saves them from a total embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan suddenly stopped mid-step, walked back up to the podium, and swooped a sign-up sheet right from the teacher&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scribbled in her info at lightning speed, then  turned around with a dazzling grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, I was gonna sit this one out. Thought I&#39;d give y&#39;all a fighting chance, you know? &#39;Cause once I&#39;m in,it&#39;s game over for everyone else. But since Natalie&#39;s begging for me to crush the competition, guess I&#39;ll do her a favor. No hard feelings, okay? When it&#39;s all said and done, just direct your resentment her way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel, who&#39;d been all fired up to join, instantly chickened out after that. This was beyond her pay grade. She glanced at Megan strutting out like she owned the place, then quickly hurried after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the door, Rachel looked back at Natalie. &#34;By the way. your hair&#39;s still green. Painfully green.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming at the insult from someone she saw as &#39;the other woman,&#39; Natalie clenched her fists so tight her nails left marks in her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia let out a soft, amused chuckle. &#34;Nat,what&#39;s the point in getting pissed? As long as she&#39;s around,you&#39;ll always be second best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded sharply. &#34;Exactly. That&#39;s why I have to win this.I need to prove I&#39;m the real deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up and marched straight to the podium,grabbing a form and filling it out without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s smile vanished instantly, her eyes narrowing with sarcasm. This idiot finally understood something?That&#39;s a first.  Outside the building, Megan and Rachel ran into Samuel, who looked fresh, upbeat, and like he just walked out of a magazine shoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a winning smile and waved. &#34;Hey, Megan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nudged Megan&#39;s arm.&#34;Uh. who&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked, eyes twinkling. &#34;Sam the Sham.&#34;</p>
