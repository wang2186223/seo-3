                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman snapped her eyes open, breath coming in quick gasps as she stared at the pale pink ceiling above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows pulled together, and her long curled lashes trembled slightly. She slowly raised her arms-hands cuffed with customized chains that quivered just like her confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My arms. Molly severed these. Didn&#39;t she?&#34; Megan thought, fingers trembling as they brushed unblemished skin. &#34;Smooth lips. intact. Is this.a dream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps approached. She instinctively pushed herself up, though her weak body made her dizzy the second she moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the soft afternoon sunlight, a tall figure stepped into view, wrapped in a golden glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was sharp, almost ethereal-thick brows, deep -set eyes, a straight nose, and thin-pressed lips. He looked like he&#39;d walked straight out of a myth-with a sickly pallor that gave him a haunted edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hate me that much,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man stood beside the bed, eyes locked onto hers,  voice low and laced with exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s nose stung. She reached out and wrapped her arms around him, pressing her small face against his firm waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan. Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s body froze. She&#39;d never said his name like that before, not with that kind of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always been slick-skilled and full of tricks, trying every possible move to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even had those cuffs made-ones that only responded to his fingerprint-just to stop her escaping again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d gone on hunger strike because of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what now? Playing a new angle? Soft power?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damp warmth soaked through his shirt,touching the muscles on his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly furrowed his brow, placing his hands on her shoulders to create distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are. are you crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d really pushed this tearless woman to tears?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged in him. Did she hate him so much she&#39;d rather fall apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to tell her-tears or not, she wasn&#39;t leaving. He never let go of what was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could speak, she hugged him again,tighter this time.  &#34;Tristan, Tristan. is this really you? Am I dreaming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this the same day from three months ago-when she had stopped eating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she.died?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her last memory was of him.plunging a blade into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be. she&#39;d really come back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan lifted a hand, wanting to gently pat her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the last second, he pulled it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No-he wouldn&#39;t give in again.	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was deep, smooth like a cello, bout cold enough to sting. &#34;Don&#39;t kid yourself. You&#39;re never getting away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan jerked her head up, grabbed her own arm,and bit down hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Way too real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face darkened, eyes narrowing. &#34;Are you still trying to hurt yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crawled up onto the bed, knelt, then threw her arms around his neck. Her voice softened to almost a whisper, &#34;I&#39;m not. I just had to know if this was real. lf you. are real. I&#39;m done running. Tristan, I missed you-so much. I really did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missed him? Wasn&#39;t it hate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t she despise him for locking her up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This-this was the Megan he&#39;d been waiting for. A version of her he&#39;d never thought he&#39;d actually see.But the sudden happiness felt too unreal. He stood frozen, not knowing how to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had cried for a while before loosening her grip around his neck and looking up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were puffy and rimmed with red, like two bruised cherries. Seeing that, Tristan felt a stabbing ache in his chest. His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed slightly as he raised a hand toward her lips. &#34;If you want to check if this is a dream, don&#39;t bite yourself-it&#39;ll hurt.Bite me instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stared at his clean, slender fingers, then wrapped her hands around his and brought them to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when Tristan thought she was about to chomp down on him, she gently kissed his hand instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; His voice was low. &#34;Trying to win me over with stuff you don&#39;t even mean? So I&#39;ll let you go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head and pressed his hand to her face,voice stuffy, &#34;Tristan, can we just try to live a normal life together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Live a normal life.He&#39;d waited way too long to hear those words. &#34;Do you. mean it?&#34; Tristan asked, still in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. I&#39;m done running. We&#39;re already engaged I&#39;m your fiancée. I&#39;ll stay with you, no matter what.&#34;Megan nodded with conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark eyes sparkled for a moment, only for doubt to flicker in soon after. &#34;You said that last time too.Didn&#39;t stop you from bolting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan knew she&#39;d let him down-again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, this very day had played out almost identically. She&#39;d done everything she could to gain Tristan&#39;s trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it had worked. He&#39;d dropped alI restrictions and stopped trying to confine her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she broke her promise, vanished, and hid in a secret underground room Molly had prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, she heard that Tristan had lost it and ended up killing her grandfather in his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when she messaged him privately, declaring war and demanding revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tried tracing her down, but she was like a ghost, completely off the grid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used her tech skills to hack into Reid Corp&#39;s internal systems, drain their funds, and leak fake financial reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reid Corp&#39;s stock crashed overnight-billions in assets gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All strategic partnerships with global companies were pulled. The entire corporation was in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seized the opportunity to take it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And throughout all this, as CEO, Tristan didn&#39;t even try to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like. he let her do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her just two months to knock Reid Corp off its pedestal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flashback zipped through Megan&#39;s mind in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep guilt washed over her.
