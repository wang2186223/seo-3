                <p>Natalie was practically bouncing with glee, already picturing Megan&#39;s downfall like it was a done deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second she turned around, a sharp pain hit the back of her neck-and she collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan calmly hauled her off the floor and tossed her onto the bed, stuffing a small black pill into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smacking her cheek firmly, Megan sneered,&#34;Greenhead, I did give you a way out. You were the one who blew it. Don&#39;t blame me now. Congrats,you&#39;re tonight&#39;s viral star. Camera&#39;s rolling in 3,2, 1!&#34;Without wasting another second, Megan darted out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, three burly men strode in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a slight sigh. Compared to Rachel, this green-haired drama queen seemed to hate her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rang up Rachel. &#34;Hey, all handled. I&#39;m stepping out for a bit of air. If Tristan asks, just say I went to the restroom and I&#39;ll be right back. You know how he worries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up and slipped out of the Imperial Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailing a cab roadside, she headed straight for Capital Hospital.  According to the plan Wyatt and Molly set, the assassin would make a move during the night shift&#39;s laundry window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan still had about twenty minutes to spare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, she arrived at the hospital,headed quickly inside, and took the elevator straight to the 11th floor, ward 3 in section 2.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, only the sleeping Bernard remained. The male nurse was off washing sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan fished out a mini syringe from her purse and injected a mild sedative into the IV line before slipping behind the bed, waiting quietly for the assassin to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Tristan, freshly showered and dressed,made his way into the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting no sign of Megan near Rachel, he frowned.&#34;Rachel, where&#39;s Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel remembered Megan&#39;s words and replied, &#34;She went to the restroom. She should be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t press further, giving a light nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short distance away, Wyatt was sprawled out in his wheelchair,smirking like he just hit the jackpot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of that woman&#39;s hot &#34;performance&#34;about to go live-with Tristan&#39;s face plastered in humiliation-was giving him a wicked dopamine rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his wvine glass, he gave Tristan a mocking toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes turned frosty as he ganced away.  Just then,his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old, grim voice warned, &#34;By Bluewater Creek.or your woman won&#39;t even leave a body behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click. The call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan instantly redialed Megan-but no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow tightened. He checked her location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red dot. Capital Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restroom,my foot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called Cameron and then bolted straight out of the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taillights of his sleek black Maybach flared as it vanished into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside, Rachel picked up on the tension.Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried calling Megan, but no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease crept up her spine-had something bad happened to her sister-in-law?At that moment,Kai Lee wasn&#39;t around. She caught sight of Kevin and rushed over. &#34;Kevin, I think something&#39;s wrong with Megan. Tristan just ran out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Kevin sprinted toward the exit, with Rachel and Chloe right on his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them jumped into a car, Kevin dialed Tristan, and as soon as he heard &#34;Capital Hospital,&#34; he floored it. Footsteps echoed steadily along the hallway,growing louder as someone approached. The soft hospital glow stretched into the room when the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of white sneakers stepped over to the bed. The man held a syringe filled with an unknown liquid,and without pause,reached for the IV tube.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Megan jumped to her feet. Bracing herself on the bed, she kicked straight at the man&#39;s stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled hard, almost crashing to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining his balance, he raised the needle and lunged toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still half-sitting on the bedside, Megan calmly slipped her hand into her bag and quickly flung out Nova Tech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova&#39;s eyes lit up with a flicker of blue. &#34;There&#39;s no tough job, only brave dogs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin blue laser shot straight for the man&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp sizzle, the smell of scorched skin filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laser seared the skin on his hand,making him drop the syringe instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could recover, Nova was already on the floor, recalibrated, and then-ZAP-aimed for somewhere particularly vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another zap, and the man&#39;s scream echoed painfully through the ward. Megan raised an eyebrow slightly, watching the guy fall to his knees, cupping himself in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, Bernard had died from an air injection leading to a fatal embolism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they switched it up-the syringe had some kind of liquid in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you? What&#39;s in that syringe?&#34; she asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat poured from the man&#39;s forehead, and he grit his teeth. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tilted her head. &#34;NNova, he says he doesn&#39;t understand. Guess he won&#39;t need ears then,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s eyes widened in panic at the glowing robot dog. &#34;Wait! I&#39;ll talk, I&#39;ll talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know exactly who hired me. They used a voice changer-could&#39;ve been a man or a woman. But I recorded it. Maybe someone can crack it. I was paid a million to come to Room 1123 at Capital Hospital and kill a Bernard. The plan was to inject him with venom from an Indian taipan. It&#39;s way stronger than your average chemical poison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Inland Taipan is the deadliest snake on Earth,its venom loaded with neurotoxins-50% post-synaptic,32% pre-synaptic-and clotting agents. It leads to massive hemorrhaging and paralysis; once bit, the venom cuts off nerve communication,paralyzing the body and eventually inducing death.  Even a small amount could turn the blood into jelly in under ten minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s hands slowly clenched into fists. Molly and Wyatt-dangerous doesn&#39;t even begin to describe them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door suddenly swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man spun around and froze at the sight of a tall,all-too-familiar figure stepping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s pupils shrank slightly. Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He followed her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his expression unreadable, Tristan calmly reached over and flipped the light switch. The room flooded with bright, cold light.Right then, Megan finally got a clear look at the guy&#39;s face-and it was the exact same as Tristan&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face was dark as night, his sharp phoenix eyes practically glowing red, every step he took was like a warning shot. His voice? Cold as ice. &#34;And what the hell was that supposed to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan swallowed hard. &#34;Laser crotch blast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a low laugh. &#34;Ha! You really didn&#39;t hesitate, huh? Even with this face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fake skin mask on the guy&#39;s face was creepy-real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nudged the little robot dog beside her. &#34;She did it.&#34;  Nova Tech turned her head, looking betrayed. &#34;Blip blip! Nova was scared to bits! Nova was only doing what the fairy lady wanted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan narrowed her pretty fox eyes, itching to punt the blabbermouth bot across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing danger, Nova dove under the hospital bed,shaking like a leaf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t waste time and kicked the kneeling man hard in the back. Blood spat out of the guy&#39;s mouth as he crashed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped over him and strode right to Megan,scooping her up into his arms. &#34;Weren&#39;t you just going to the restroom? Hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His low voice had that dangerous, sexy lilt to it. Megan gave a sheepish nod. then shook her head. &#34;This guy...was sent to kill my grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Tristan pressed his lips to hers,silencing her with a fierce kiss-clearly not in the mood for more explanations right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man on the floor gritted his teeth through the pain, and tried his best to crawl quietly toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only to be stopped by a pair of shiny black dress shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With despair, he looked up-straight into the face of someone wearing a grin that screamed &#34;bad news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the click-clack of heels.  Rachel looked from the intense lip-lock to the scene on the floor and twvitched. &#34;Are you guys serious? Did I just walk in on a rom-com?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she blurted, &#34;What the hell?! That guy looks just like my brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe practically jumped. &#34;What in the world is going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin squinted at the edge of the guy&#39;s mask starting to peel near his ear, then just yanked the whole thing off in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the man a pointed look. &#34;You walking out on your own,or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy clenched his jaw, then suddenly screamed,&#34;Help! Mur-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Kevin knocked him out cold with one punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, casually flicking his hair back, he looked at Chloe. &#34;Do I look macho or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe nodded hard. &#34;Goofball Bro,you&#39;re a legend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All their chatter finally broke the tender moment between Megan and Tristan. They pulled apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot a side glance at the peanut gallery. &#34;Kevin,you deal with this guy. He tried to kill Bernard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he grabbed Megan&#39;s hand and led her right out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy on the floor was out cold, and the rest of them instinctively stood against the wall like they&#39;d  been called to order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s final words echoed behind her, &#34;I&#39;m fine.Cops are on the way. There&#39;s a hidden cam above the curtains-it caught everything.&#34;</p>
