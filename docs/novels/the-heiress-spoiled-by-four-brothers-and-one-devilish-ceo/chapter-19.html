                <p>Before they even reached the front door, it flung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A well-dressed woman with an elaborate updo stormed out. After shooting a nasty glare at Tristan and Megan, she darted toward Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my poor baby! What happened? You&#39;re coughing up blood?!&#34; she cried dramatically, her voice shrill and full of sorrow. &#34;Just look at his neck! Those bruises-he&#39;s covered in fingerprints!What kind of karmais this?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wailing was so over-the-top, it could&#39;ve been mistaken for a funeral. The noise pulled everyone inside the house out to see what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the group was Geoffrey Reid-the family patriarch-his silver hair sleeked back, eyes still sharp with age. He rested his hand upon his silver-topped cane as he emerged onto the porch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan&#39;s back? And this must be Megan?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a soft nod. &#34;Nice to meet you, Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, good.&#34; His gaze drifted toward the lawn, where mother and son played out their dramatic scene-one on the ground, the other wailing like it was the end of the world.  &#34;And what happened here?&#34; he asked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face didn&#39;t show the slightest ripple. &#34;Wyatt tried to hit Megan in the back of the head with a golf club. I simply gave him some discipline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia, still putting on her teary show, shuffled over like she couldn&#39;t keep it together. &#34;Dad, you&#39;ve got to say something! Wyatt&#39;s spitting blood! Look at him-there are fingerprints all over his neck! Tristan didn&#39;t just hit him-he went all out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan Reid furrowed his brows, looking unimpressed.&#34;Stop exaggerating. Wyatt&#39;s a strong kid. Let him get checked out at the hospital and quit making a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia glared at Nathan with resentment in her eyes-but kept her mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, the family&#39;s women started whispering to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clearly, they&#39;re not born of the same mother. No closeness at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! He really went too far! Kids born outside the main line always lack manners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes sharpened, coldly locking onto the woman who just spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, everyone knows Tristan&#39;s parents were married-it was just family politics that split them apart,&#34;she said, tone icy. &#34;If you don&#39;t even know what &#39;illegitimate child&#39; means, stop pretending you&#39;re cultured. You&#39;re embarrassing yourself.&#34;  She slowly turned the wedding ring on her finger, her voice calm but cutting. &#34;You know what they say,never forget where your blessings come from. You sure you&#39;re not taking this easy life for granted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one she called out was Evelyn-Tristan&#39;s third aunt -in-law. She snapped back, looking honestly a little wronged. &#34;Kids these days have no respect. Talking back to elders like it&#39;s nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her husband, Harrison Reid, stepped up, his pride clearly stung. &#34;Tch, now even outsiders can act like they own the place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan clutched Tristan&#39;s arm, eyes slightly misty,like she might cry. &#34;Babe. they&#39;re calling me an outsider.That really hurts. I thought being married meant I was part of the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit like a thunderbolt. Everyone stood there stunned-hadn&#39;t she just put them all in their place?And now... she looked like the one being wronged?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze was icy cold, an almost dangerous sharpness in his aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept across the crowd, lips curling into a faint smirk that sent shivers down spines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe y&#39;all are holdinga bit too much of the company&#39;s shares,&#34; he said lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his voice dropped, several people gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey&#39;s eyes flicked toward Harrison and Evelyn.  &#34;You two have been dropping by the main house an awful lot lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation: Don&#39;t bother showing up anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian chuckled, trying to diffuse the tension.&#34;Tristan&#39;s wife just got officially introduced to the family today-no need to crowd the doorway, let&#39;s all head inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tugged gently at his wife Pearl Bennett&#39;s arm.The woman forced a smile and said, &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s Megan&#39;s first time visiting the house. Let&#39;s go inside and catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Megan hadn&#39;t forgotten how the woman just moments ago said they weren&#39;t close since they weren&#39;t born of the same mother. Acting nice now wouldn&#39;t change anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid turned to Nathan and instructed, &#34;Go check on Wyatt&#39;s injuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan gave a small nod and led Sophia over to help Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Reid then looked at Tristan and Megan. &#34;Come on,Tristan, Megan. Let&#39;s go inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as Megan disliked being in places like this,she knew some things couldn&#39;t be avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her job was to stand by her man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the grand living room, Mr. Reid settled down on an ornate golden nanmu armchair. He stroked his greying beard, eyes warm as he looked at Megan. &#34;Megan, there might&#39;ve been some rough patches before, but I&#39;m glad things worked out between you two in the end. This marriage, planned long ago with youur grandfather, turns out wasn&#39;t in vain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he pulled a red silk box from his pocket and handed it to Mr. Stewart beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Stewart stepped forward and presented the velvet box to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid gave a low chuckle, his gaze steady. &#34;This brooch belonged to Tristan&#39;s grandmother. An Edwardian piece, set with emeralds and diamonds. It&#39;s been in the family for generations.&#34; He paused,his eyes resting on Megan. &#34;We felt it fitting that Megan should wear it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words settled, Pearl Bennett and Evelyn exchanged a fleeting glance, their expressions unreadable save for a tightening around the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan opened the box, revealing the antique brooch nestled within. The intricate platinum setting held vibrant emeralds encircled by shimmering diamonds,a testament to timeless craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met his grandfather&#39;s gaze, his voice filled with understanding.&#34;Thank you,Grandpa.It&#39;s magnificent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s breath caught slightly as she looked at the heirloom. &#34;Thank you, Grandpa,&#34; she said softly,her fingers lightly tracing the edge of the box.&#34;s an honor.I promise to cherish it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid let out a hearty laugh. &#34;Good! Excellent! From  now on, Tristan will take over my position as head of the Reid family. Megan will be our matriarch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head of the family had complete control over all business affairs and could revoke any delegated rights,including shares. Before, Tristan could only suggest taking back shares, and the recipient still had the option to plead with the family head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? One word from Tristan, and it was final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian and Harrison were clearly displeased. In their eyes, the old man had lost it-passing the family to a so-called illegitimate kid instead of his own sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison clenched his fists. &#34;Dad, does Nathan even know about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid snorted. &#34;Do I need anyone&#39;s permission to make decisions? Between you three,who comes close to Tristan&#39;s competence? Our family should be handed to someone who can actually handle it. Any objections?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn muttered under her breath, &#34;Dad clearly plays favorites... we&#39;ve got another grandson, haven&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid tapped his cane hard and snapped, &#34;You mean Wyatt? That kid lives for food and parties. If he took over, we&#39;d be bankrupt in no time. Anyone else got something to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone fell silent after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, Mr.Reid nodded. Then he turned to Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard your grandfather&#39;s not doing well these days?&#34;  Megan nodded. &#34;We went to see him yesterday.He already had Alzheimer&#39;s, and now he&#39;s also been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Things aren&#39;t looking good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan added, &#34;I&#39;ve reached out to Brandon Lewis.He&#39;ll be back in about two weeks to examine Megan&#39;s grandfather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear,&#34; Mr. Reid said with relief,waving at Tristan. &#34;Come with me to the study, Tristan.&#34;</p>
