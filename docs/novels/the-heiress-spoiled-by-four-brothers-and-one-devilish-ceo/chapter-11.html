                <p>The sweet scent of chocolate filled the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan opened her eyes with a smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Now do you finally believe it&#39;s sweet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan licked his lips, eyes full of contentment. &#34;Not as sweet as you. You&#39;re easily the sweetest thing in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow slightly, amused. &#34;Wow, I didn&#39;t know you were such a smooth talker. Have you used that line on someone else before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only on you,&#34; Tristan said seriously. &#34;This life, next life,every life-only you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave a little ache at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This life, she swore she&#39;d treasure it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this man-she&#39;d love him with all she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her eyes turning misty, Tristan shifted a little,unsure. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, babe? Did I overdo it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook her head quickly and took a small spoonful of her ice cream to hide her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the chill hit her throat instantly, making her cough a couple of times. &#34;No, I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just... talking about this life made me think of my grandpa. Molly came by a week ago and said he&#39;s in the hospital. I&#39;m  not even sure how he&#39;s doing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already had Alzheimer&#39;s, and now he&#39;s got a brain tumor.It really doesn&#39;t sound good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached over to gently ruffle her hair. &#34;Then let&#39;s go see him now. After we get our marriage certificate tomorrow, we&#39;ll swing by your old place too.&#34;&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled out and headed toward the Capital Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Megan glanced over and asked carefully,&#34;Aren&#39;t you curious about that 3V VIP card ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan spared her a quick glance. &#34;You studied design.You even spent half a semester in France, right?Knowing some top designers isn&#39;t exactly out of left field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lila Moore might keep a low profile, but that doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t have friends. Honestly, the real surprise is that she has taste good enough to make friends with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked out the window, murmuring,&#34;Yeah. Lila really does have good taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the hospital just before noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading up, the two picked up a couple of magazines and a comfort care set from a nearby shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to Room 1123 in neurosurgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing open the door, they saw an elderly man with white hair and reading glasses, reclining in bed with a  book. A male nurse was peeling an apple beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing footsteps, the old man looked up and peered at the door. &#34;Who are you here for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quickly/stepped closer and gently held his arm.&#34;Grandpa, it&#39;s me, Megan. I came to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan. Megan.&#34; Bernard Shaw looked blank. &#34;I don&#39;t remember you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had expected this. His condition had clearly gotten worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver stood up and gave her a polite nod.&#34;Hello, Miss. I&#39;m Mr. Shawv&#39;s nurse. And you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m his granddaughter, Megan,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bernard stared at her for a beat, then muttered to himself,&#34;Megan? Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,he clutched his head with both hands.&#34;My head.it hurts. it hurts so bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes rolled back, foam gathered at his mouth-he was having a seizure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse rushed to press the emergency call button while explaining, &#34;Lately, this happens a lot. When he sees a face that sparks a memory, he tries to remember, and it triggers these headaches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a doctor and two nurses came rushing in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan set down the bouquet and fruit basket on the nearby table, then gently pulled Megan aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the doctor&#39;s orders, one nurse gave Bernard a sedative, another a painkiller injection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,he quieted down and drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all stepped outside the ward.Tristan looked straight at the doctor and asked, &#34;Hi, Doctor. Can you tell me how likely Mr. Shaw&#39;s surgery is to succeed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s eyes lit up the moment he recognized him, his tone turning extra polite. &#34;Oh, so it&#39;s Mr. Reid -what a pleasure! Mr. Shaw&#39;s brain tumor is malignant.Honestly, the odds of a successful surgery are only around twenty percent. Afterward, he&#39;ll still need chemotherapy,radiation, and targeted treatments to tackle the remaining cancer cells. Given his current health, things don&#39;t look very optimistic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan frowned. &#34;Isn&#39;t there a better option?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor shook his head. &#34;Post-surgery treatment is one thing, but the key is the operation itself. If you can get Professor Brandon Lewis-he&#39;s an international neurosurgery expert-the chances could jump to at least sixty percent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan spoke at the same time, &#34;The Lewis family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor nodded. &#34;Word is, Professor Lewis should be back from the States by mid-September. If you can get him to take the case, your odds are a lot better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor left, Megan looked at Tristan. &#34;I heard Brandon Lewis is kind of cold. He doesn&#39;t accept just any case.&#34; Tristan reached out, lightly ruffling her hair.&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got this. I know him personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;That&#39;s a relief. Thank you, Tristan.&#34;&#34;Uh-uh. Say &#39;honey.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled,eyes full of gratitude. &#34;Thanks, honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending some more time in the hospital with Bernard, the two finally headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after they drove off, a flashy red Ferrari pulled up at the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stepped out,swinging her branded LX handbag,and walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the room, she pulled off her sunglasses and glanced at the man in the hospital bed. Her tone was dripping with arrogance. &#34;Anyone been here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caretaker nodded. &#34;Yes, the richest man of the ountry, Mr. Reid, came by. And a pretty young lady named Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s fingers clenched around her sunglasses until-crack-the frame snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chin tilted high, she snapped, &#34;Go bring me some hot water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caretaker scratched his head. &#34;Actually, the thermos already has freshly boiled water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly inhaled deeply, smiled sarcastically, and said,&#34;I  told you to go. Problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no choice, the flustered caretaker lifted the full thermos and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly waited until the coast was clear before stepping to the bedside, smnacking Bernard&#39;s face and giving his arm a vicious twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned cruel like a snake&#39;s, voice low and venomous. &#34;You old bastard. You&#39;ve always favored that little b*tch. Now look at you-totally useless. Just wait. I won&#39;t let any of you live in peace. Not a single one of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a cold snort and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the caretaker returned,he noticed Bernard&#39;s red cheek. Scratching his head, he murmured,&#34;Weird.Did he scratch himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the car, Molly was fuming as she slammed the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up with a sweet voice. &#34;Hey, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to the hospital to see Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good kid. Always so thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly, we&#39;re all going to Mr. Reid&#39;s birthday banquet this Saturday. Pickout a good gift. It&#39;s a big deal.You&#39;ll get to meet some important people.&#34;  &#34;Got it,Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, a strange little smile curled at Molly&#39;s lips as her eyes narrowed.</p>
