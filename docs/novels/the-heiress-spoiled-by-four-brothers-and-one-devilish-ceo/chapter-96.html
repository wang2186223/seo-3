                <p>&#34;Kev! Kev!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe waved her slim little hand as soon as she spotted Kevin with his hair all messy like he&#39;d just wrestled a tornado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin dashed over, arms spread wide like he was about to scoop the tiny girl into a hug-only to feel his collar yank back hard. No matter how he leaned,he just couldn&#39;t get to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He twitched a smile, glancing sideways. Megan stared at him with a smirk, clearly entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think those arms of yours are reaching a little too far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin took a step back, not even bothering to argue.&#34;Didn&#39;t manage to hug her. Guess they&#39;re still too short.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his gaze landed on Tristan, blood staining his shirt. His eyes flew open. &#34;Damn! You got shot? Who did it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face was tight. &#34;No clue. Got a smoke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin fished a pack and a silver lighter from his suit pocket, handing them over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slid a cigarette out, lit it with a flick, the flame tinting the tip red. He took a deep drag and exhaled through gritted teeth. &#34;They used some kind of Sorcery worm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?!&#34; Kevin&#39;s expression flipped. &#34;Who died?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe pointed at the ghastly corpse on the ground.&#34;Molly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good riddance,&#34; Kevin muttered, shooting the body a disgusted look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ryan strode in. &#34;Mr. Reid, we need you to come down to the station and help with the investigation.&#34;  Megan kept calm. &#34;He&#39;s got a bullet wound. Let him get treated first. We&#39;ll come in tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan gave a nod. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a faint smirk. &#34;Kinda been running into you a lot lately,Captain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan held back a sigh. These two? Wherever they went, chaos followed. Practically magnetized to crime scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he remembered what Tristan said earlier.&#34;Mr.Reid, did you say Molly was killed by a sorcery worm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Nova, hand the evidence to Captain Mitchell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova floated over to Ryan. He quickly called over the coroner to bring an evidence bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they opened it, Nova tossed in a clump of black something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; Ryan&#39;s eye twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It self-destructed,&#34; Tristan replied. Ryan swallowed hard. &#34;Yikes. That&#39;s rough. My old mentor told me about a similar case-used sorcery worms too. But that one went cold, what, twenty years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan dropped the cigarette, grinding it out under his boot. His face was shadowed in smoke. &#34;Guess that cold case is about to heat up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s face darkened. He knew Tristan never said anything without a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mentor had warned him-some big figures were involved back then. That&#39;s why the case got buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if it really came back now, it&#39;d shake everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slung an arm over Megan&#39;s shoulder and started walking out of the warehouse. But then he paused, glanced back. &#34;Send me the autopsy reports for Molly and the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan stared at the black evidence in the bag. &#34;Will do.&#34; Kevin rubbed his hands together. &#34;Uh. Chloe, you cold or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe nodded seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s face lit up as he moved to drape an arm around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could touch her, the little thing tugged his jacket right off and wrapped herself in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin sniffed, watching her bounce off. &#34;That.didn&#39;t go like it was supposed to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chuckled, seeing Kevin&#39;s lost-face expression.&#34;Aren&#39;t you, like, way older than her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin shot him a deadly glare. &#34;So what if I like younger girls? Got a problem? Keep it to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he chased after that skipping figure. &#34;Chloe,your wrist got all scraped up-I&#39;ll blow on it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan scratched the back of his head. &#34;I never said you were old, man, just older than her. Why so defensive?&#34; Dreamscape Manor.Hearing the sound of an engine,Zeta Prime was already standing at the villa entrance like a statue, waiting anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Tristan and Megan got out of the car,it rushed toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as it got closer, it paused. &#34;Zeta Prime detects a 9mm Parabellum lodged in the master&#39;s shoulder.Alert: injury detected!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech fluttered down onto its head. &#34;Master took on twelve guys solo. None made it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime&#39;s eyes flashed. &#34;Minor injury on our side,full wipeout on theirs. Solid win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot it a cold glare. &#34;Zip it, or you&#39;re getting scrapped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation: Don&#39;t go snitching to Mr. Reid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime swatted Nova Tech off its head.&#34;Detected unidentified substance on Nova&#39;s clawS.Identity?&#34; &#34;Bug poop!&#34; Nova chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime flailed its robot hands over its head. &#34;Oh no! My reputation! I&#39;ve been defiled!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the robots&#39; drama, Tristan and Megan hurried back into the villa and headed straight to their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes later, Max Adams, the private doctor,arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s white shirt was soaked through with blood-looked seriously bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max carefully snipped open the shirt. The bullet was deep in his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the anesthetic, but Tristan stopped him.&#34;Did you forget? I don&#39;t react to anesthetics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max froze.&#34;Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron, just arriving, caught that. Eyes blinking.Wait,when did he become immune to anesthetics?That was news to him. &#34;Sir, Amelia was bailed out by her dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan buried his head in Megan&#39;s arms and gave a quiet &#34;Mm.&#34; &#34;Let it be. The Reids can&#39;t afford a fallout with the Lewises. She&#39;s had her lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max dabbed the surrounding blood away with iodine-soaked gauze, cleaning the area slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the bullet was so deep, he had to use a scalpel to open it up more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, I&#39;ll need to widen the cut a bit. Brace yourself,&#34; Max warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s other arm wrapped around Megan&#39;s waist.&#34;It&#39;s fine.I can take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max sighed. What is he trying to prove?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began cutting; the sound of blade on flesh made everyone tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brow furrowed, cold sweat trailing down the contours of his defined back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the veins at his temple popped from the pain. Megan couldn&#39;t bear to watch. She clutched his head close,heart aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nestled in her arms curled his lips ever so slightly.&#34;Tss.hurts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max nearly dropped the scalpel in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron&#39;s jaw hung low. &#34;Should we maybe try a tiny bit of anesthesia? Who knows, maybe it works this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s sharp gaze silenced any further thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron finally got it-this was all an act. A pain act.The classic &#34;make-her-feel-bad&#34; move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan kept groaning in pain the whole time, and Max felt his own nerves stretch thin. Still, he managed to extract the bullet and stitch him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullet landed in the disposal tray with a clink.Max exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he packed up to leave, he turned at the door with a grin. &#34;No intense movement for a while.&#34; Megan blushed instantly, mumbling under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot Cameron a side glance. &#34;Do you need something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-nope.&#34; Cameron bounced out of the room like he was escaping a fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tilted his head up, looking at Megan. &#34;Megan,it hurts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently wiped the sweat off his forehead. &#34;I&#39;ll go find you a painkiller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she was about to walk away, Tristan pulled her into his arms and onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes glowing, he murmured, &#34;You&#39;re my medicine.&#34;</p>
