                <p>Megan narrowed her dewy eyes, locking onto the big screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there it was-the dresses on her model and Amelia&#39; were basically twins. Cut, fabric, even the sheen-it was a one-to-one match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd broke into whispers and murmurs instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a staff member knocked on the door,asking Megan to head out and address the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia,hot-tempered as ever, was about to storm up there first, but Megan stopped her with a calm hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wait down here,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stepped onto the runway at an unhurried pace, the hem of her starlight gown swaying gently with a pearly shimmer under the lights. Even the skeptics watching from below had to admit it-this woman was stunning, flawless like a polished jewel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came to a halt beside three featured models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just two meters away, Amelia stood next to her own model, expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three judges-Jeffery Grant, Elena Glancy, and Sean Greene-shared uncertain glances. The whole hall had gone silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the mic let out a sharp screech that made some wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean Greene leaned in and tested it, &#34;We&#39;ll hear from both participants for an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Host John moved to Amelia, who lifted her hand requesting to speak first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked perfectly calm and innocent. &#34;I have no idea what&#39;s going on. But those three dresses-yeah,they&#39;re from my original designs.&#34; John then handed the mic to Megan. &#34;Ms. Shaw, your response?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked straight at the judges. &#34;Those dresses are from my sketches. I&#39;ve got nothing to hide. Let&#39;s just show both our drafts and clear this up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges huddled for a moment before signaling to the team to bring Megan and Amelia&#39;s drafts up on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Big screens lit up on both sides of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the left: Megan&#39;s sketches. On the right: Amelia&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a sec, Megan&#39;s drawings don&#39;t match the dresses at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of seals it-Megan copied Amelia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The designs, the material-way too similar to be a coincidence. No way that&#39;s not plagiarism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is beyond embarrassing, the whole country&#39;s watching. Let&#39;s see how her little fan club defends her now.&#34; &#34;She even wanted to collaborate with that superstar?What a joke. No doubt the Lewis family&#39;s done with her too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants it all, huh? Tsk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a short, cold laugh and waved John over with a tiny motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward quickly, and she snatched the mic from his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to a well-dressed, flashy woman in the audience who&#39;d just accused her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said if I didn&#39;t plagiarize, you&#39;d rip your own head off,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman stood up dramatically, chin raised high.&#34;Your sketch doesn&#39;t match the clothes. Obviously,it&#39;s plagiarism! Disgraceful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled without warmth. &#34;Well, I&#39;ll be waiting to see that pig head.&#34; Then she turned to Amelia, eyes sharp. &#34;You&#39;re really sure those sketches are yours? I&#39;mn giving you one last chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia looked like she might cry. &#34;Megan. I know those dresses are stunning and you admire them, but you should respect other people&#39;s hard work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan cut her off coldly. &#34;I already gave you a way out. You&#39;re the one who blew it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s heart pounded like a drum. Could Megan actually have proof?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way. The pencils, the paper-it&#39;s all pretty standard stuff. Easily faked.Not to mention, all the cameras in the hallway and the office mysteriously stopped working that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, she wasn&#39;t the one who switched the sketches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So as long as she stuck to her claim, no one would find a loophole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood firm, &#34;This is my design!&#34; Megan turned tothe three judges. &#34;What happens to someone who&#39;s confirmed to have plagiarized today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffery replied, voice stern, &#34;Anyone caught plagiarizing today won&#39;t be allowed to work as a designer in Verduria again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes were sharp, her smile faint. &#34;Whoever copied today has no place in this industry again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elena raised an eyebrow at Megan&#39;s words.Something felt off. She let out a curious chuckle,&#34;Alright. If we prove someone copied, they&#39;re out of the design world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at the host, John. &#34;Bring me the sketches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John blinked. &#34;You mean Amelia&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nearly smacked him with the mic. Her voice went cold.&#34;Mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John gulped, then took the sketch papers from a staff member and handed them to Megan. She tossed him the mic. He caught it instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These seem pretty ordinary, right? But. there&#39;s a trick to them,&#34; Megan said as she gently rubbed one corner. &#34;They can actually split in two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she peeled the paper into two separate sheets-every single sketch did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia clenched her fists, her lashes trembling. &#34;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d figure that part out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a soft laugh. &#34;That dress you&#39;re wearing today? Definitely suits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Amelia frowned, clearly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips.&#34;Such a lovely little angel. with poison under her halo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-how could you humiliate me like this!&#34; Amelia&#39;s pale cheeks flushed deep red, looking a picture of righteous indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean shrugged. &#34;Well, that doesn&#39;t really prove anything yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan handed the torn sketches to her go-to models-each got two sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn them around. Let the blank sides face the judges!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three models held up the paper so the supposedly blank sides faced forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was puzzled. It was just plain white paper-nothing special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman decked out in pearls and diamonds sneered, &#34;Trying too hard. Just admit you copied already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after her words, gasps echoed through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-look! There&#39;s writing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the six sheets held by Zoe, Rebecca, and Jane,letters slowly revealed themselves- &#34;IAMLIMO.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Lila Moore!&#34; &#34;What the heck-isn&#39;t that the famous international designer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience buzzed with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia hadn&#39;t seen this coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffery leaned forward, curious. &#34;Care to explain what all this means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan just shrugged. &#34;Just a little insurance against people stealing my work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This paper looks totally normal, but it&#39;s actually layered with a film. Once the paper&#39;s split, and the film&#39;s exposed to air,it vanishes fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I treated it with phenol, which oxidizes in air and turns into a brownish color-what you&#39;re seeing now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Amelia. &#34;Did you know about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia bit down hard, red nails pressing into her palm, not even feeling the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she said no, that&#39;d make her a liar. She took a long breath. &#34;Of course I knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan laughed, almost giddy. &#34;Then tell me-where did you get your paper?&#34;</p>
