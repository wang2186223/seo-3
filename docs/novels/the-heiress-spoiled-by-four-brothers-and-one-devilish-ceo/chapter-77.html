                <p>Tristan gently turned her face to him, he was already kissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some cuddling, the two finally got up, washed up,and headed downstairs for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They each took their own car and left the Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Megan reached the gates of Meridian University, Tristan&#39;s car slowly blended into traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Rachel yanked open the door,scooping up her tote and paper bag from the passenger seat and hopping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she instantly launched into chatter mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, sis-in-law!&#34; she beamed. &#34;Guess what?Jason Lewis is doing an outdoor shoot at our campus today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes, unimpressed. &#34;You mean the guy who said I looked like his mom and tried to gift me a necklace? That Jason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel winced slightly at her attitude. &#34;C&#39;mon! Sixty billion views! You could&#39;ve taken it and passed it to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drove into the campus, Megan let out a light snort. &#34;Your brother doesn&#39;t need that kind of money.&#34; &#34;Yeah, well, I do!&#34; Rachel grinned, looking down at the paper bag. &#34;Hey, what&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sketches. Today&#39;s the deadline, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel peeled it open, raising her brows the more she saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! These are seriously good! Very LX vibe,&#34; she gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced over. This girl did have a decent eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said casually, &#34;Noticed how LX&#39;s hype&#39;s been dipping lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Yeah, a bit. Feels like their latest stuff isn&#39;t really LiMo&#39;s work. More like some knockoff vibe, honestly. Still, LX&#39;s still in the global top three-nobody&#39;s shaking that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But hey, sis, maybe tweak your style a bit? Just in case critics try to drag you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled, &#34;If you&#39;re not guilty, you don&#39;t fear the shadow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked.&#34;.Why does that somehow sound...off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They parked in front of the main teaching building and got out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front entrance was packed, people standing like five rows deep, all phones raised high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel tugged Megan toward the flowerbed on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled up for a better view, looked down at Megan who stayed on the ground, and exclaimed, Jason! No wonder it&#39;s crowded here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Megan muttered, &#34;He showed up at Grandpa&#39;s birthday party too. Why are you losing your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he&#39;s hot! Like, insanely hot!&#34;Seeing Rachel fangirling so hard, Megan chuckled and just happened to catch a familiar figure walking in against the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, &#34;Think he&#39;s as handsome as Kai?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When my Kai Ge isn&#39;t around, Jason is definitely top -tier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grinned, adding fuel to the fire, &#34;So what if Kai shows up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel stood on her toes, eagerly scanning the crowd.&#34;Secretly? Even with Kai Ge here, Jason&#39;s still a total dreamboat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm, slightly icy voice cut in,&#34;Oh? Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Rachel froze mid-blurt, then turned stiffly to see the man beside her. &#34;Wait-Kai? Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai didn&#39;t even answer-just threw her over his shoulder and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan covered her mouth, trying not to burst out laughing. She shook her head and strolled toward the steps of the academic building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sound of hurried footsteps-something in the rhythm prickled her instincts. That aura? Danger. And it was aimed straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning around in a flash, her eyes went cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was Natalie, lunging at her with a military knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around them started screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wretched bitch! You deserve to die!&#34; Natalie shrieked, eyes bloodshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom&#39;s face is ruined because of you! You should pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech wasn&#39;t with Megan today-Zeta Prime was working on a new gadget for her-so she had to rely on herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dodged swiftly,reacting purely on instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Natalie couldn&#39;t land a hit and completely lost it.Roaring with rage, she screamed, &#34;Fine! If I can&#39;t get you,I&#39;ll take someone else down with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand clenching the knife tight, she started thrashing wildly toward the poor students nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Die with her, all of you! It&#39;s all her fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged toward a terrified girl who was frozen and could only scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quickly stepped in and shoved the girl away,but in the process, the kraft paper folder she was holding slipped and fell, scattering the design sketches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she bent back to dodge a counter-swing,Natalie&#39;s blade sliced through the air-close enough to brush her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a sharp, agonizing shout ripped through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan jolted upright, turning to see Jason holding Natalie&#39;s wrist in a death grip, his face steely and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fierce eyes gleamed with a barely contained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blade clattered to the ground, blood dripping nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the trail of red, Megan&#39;s eyes landed on Jason&#39;s right forearm. His crisp white shirt was already soaked in crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Directors, producers, fellow actors all rushed over,tackling Natalie to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby fans were ready to swarm her, fists clenched,ready to make her pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason raised his hand slightly to calm the crowd.&#34;Everyone chill-let the cops handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re bleeding. You need to get that checked out.&#34;Megan&#39;s voice softened with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason glanced at the wound, gave a relaxed smile.&#34;It&#39;s nothing.You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Thanks.&#34; Though honestly,I probably could&#39;ve handled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t feel like dragging myself across town to the hospital right now. Got another scene coming up.Will you go with me to the school clinic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since it was her fault he got hurt, Megan couldn&#39;t refuse. Still, seeing all that blood made her hesitate. The wound didn&#39;t look shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked closer and gently rolled up his sleeve-her breath catching as she saw the gash. It was deep. At least ten stitches,easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The school clinic might not cut it. If they don&#39;t do it right, you&#39;ll have a scar,&#34; Megan said, a hint of guilt creeping in. After all, scars were no joke for actors &#34;Better head to an actual hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jason&#39;s agent, Julius Graham, walked over.&#34;Come on, Jason. I&#39;ll get you to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason paused for a beat, noted Megan&#39;s expression,and finally nodded. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, he walked a fewN steps, picked up the dropped designs and kraft. folder with his left hand,and handed them back to Megan.Just as they were about to get in the car, someone came running over in a hurry.</p>
