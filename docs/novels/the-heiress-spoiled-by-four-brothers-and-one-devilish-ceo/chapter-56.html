                <p>Geoffrey let out a quiet sigh. &#34;Tristan&#39;s the head of the family now, Megan is the lady of the house-l&#39;ve stepped down long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he and Bruce headed into the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel followed closely behind. Just before stepping inside,Megan turned her head slightly and flashed Sophia and Wyatt a devilish little smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the elegantly furnished lounge,Geoffrey and Bruce sat in hand-carved walnut armchairs, sipping Scotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel made their way to the study to retrieve the stick used for enforcing family rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Meg, are you really gonna hit Aunt Sophia with that stick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. What do you think it&#39;s for? Just decor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel hesitated,looking worried. &#34;But if you do this,won&#39;t they end up hating us even more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tapped a knuckle on her own smooth forehead.&#34;Even if you kneel and serve them on a tray, they&#39;d still find a way to finish you off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out a rectangular agarwood box from the bookshelf. Inside, nestled in red velvet, was a dark iron  birch rod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This stuff was no joke-iron birch was known for its insane hardness. Even a bullet would bounce off like it hit steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked it up, gave it a few experimental swings,the corners of her lips curling into a sly grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Sophia wheeled Wyatt into the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood with her hands behind her back, head tilted,wearing a sweet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To others, it might&#39;ve looked all innocent. But to Sophia and Wyatt, it was pure venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So.who wants to go first? Ladies, maybe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clenched her fists, visibly shaken, but still stepped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d seen what that stick could do. Back in the day,Harrison had been beaten half to death with it for his partying and gambling habits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least-Sophia comforted herself-this woman was just a girl. How strong could she be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in front of Megan, her eyes were full of disdain. &#34;No matter what,you still have to call me Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan snorted. &#34;You should try that line on Tristan.Might get a better reaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, the stick came down on Sophia&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agh!&#34; A painful scream rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked, looking surprised. &#34;That was barely a  tap! I haven&#39;t even used any real strength yet. Want me to wait till after dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s whole body trembled as she gritted her teeth.&#34;Hit my back instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Mr. Reid&#39;s birthday celebration coming up, she didn&#39;t want to show up looking like she just survived a beatdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem!&#34; Megan swung the rod again,this time with no holding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about all the cruel things Sophia and Wyatt had done to Tristan made her blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bring it on-let the stick do the talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was soon filled with one painful howl after another.Sophia was drenched in cold sweat,every smack from that wvicked woman&#39;s stick felt like a punch from a grown man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Stop it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt roared in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot him a sideways glance, calm as ever.&#34;Didn&#39;t Aunt Sophia bring up the family rules first?What, we just ignore them when it&#39;s inconvenient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s eyes darkened dangerously as he growled,&#34;Then let me take her punishment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia quickly shook her head. &#34;No, your health&#39;s not back yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Megan. &#34;Whatever hits are left for him,I&#39;ll take them too.&#34;&#34;Sure. Happy to grant your wish.&#34; Megan&#39;s smile was faint, almost sarcastic, as she raised the wooden rod again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whap. Sixty strikes-no more, no less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after,Megan called for Mrs. Ford to help Sophia upstairs and tend to her injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Wyatt sitting in his wheelchair,her gaze cold and sharp. &#34;Sometimes keeping your mouth shut can save you a whole lot of trouble. Keep scheming against others, and you&#39;ll be the one paying the price.It really doesn&#39;t cost to be decent, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, sweeping her eyes across the room.&#34;Tristan and I will be living here for a while. So... let&#39;s get along,shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she looked straight at Rachel. &#34;Send the video to the family group chat. I think some folks still don&#39;t quite get the new rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was aimed right at Pearl and Evelyn-a not-so-subtle way of letting them know who&#39;s in charge now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt sat there, rage thick in his eyes, before wordlessly wheeling himself toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Megan wiped off the wooden rod with a handkerchief handed to her by a maid, she casually gave it to Rachel. &#34;Put it back in Granddad&#39;s study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Geoffrey and gave him a deep bow.&#34;Thanks for backing me up, Grandpa. I believe these new rules will help clear out the noise.&#34; Geoffrey hadn&#39;t expected Megan to have such guts He couldn&#39;t help but admire her. &#34;If you&#39;d married in earlier, I could&#39;ve retired ages ago! Haha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce set his whiskey glass down with a grin. &#34;This girl&#39;s got Tristan&#39;s fire, no doubt about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ago, Megan had been all sharp edges and steel. Now, she wore a bright, easy smile as she walked over and topped off the elders&#39; glasses with smooth amber whiskey. &#34;Tristan says you&#39;re a Go fan,Grandpa. Thought I&#39;d challenge you to a match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey raised a brow, clearly amused. &#34;Oh? You know how to play?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a confident smile. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did the trick. His eyes lit up. &#34;Now we&#39;re talking!Someone bring out the Go board!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Stewart quickly stepped out and returned moments later with the board and stones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce stood up and gestured to Megan with a grin.&#34;Your grandpa&#39;s a real Go master. You&#39;re in for a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the game began, tension simmered quietly on the other side of the house.The video of Sophia getting beaten was thrown into the family group chat. No one said anything publicly, but behind the scenes? Total chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearl called Evelyn. &#34;Hey, did you see? Big sis got smacked hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn scoffed, &#34;That damn woman came in swinging. Classic scare tactic to warn the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! And the old man didn&#39;t just let it happen-he watched the whole thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I ever gget the chance, she&#39;s gonna get a taste of her own medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearl hesitated, &#34;But you saw how the old man&#39;s siding with her now. Might be safer not to go head-on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m thinking of dropping by my cousin&#39;s this afternoon. You coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, I can&#39;t. Lina&#39;s got a parent-teacher thing today.Maybe tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow? Pfft, might as well wait till the old man&#39;s birthday party the day after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn muttered angrily at her phone.&#34;Typical fence -sitter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison, who&#39;d been half-watching TV, gave a cold snort. &#34;Still don&#39;t get it, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The old man&#39;s letting that woman clean house on purpose. You try to push against her, side with your cousin, and you&#39;re next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn paused, thinking it over. &#34;Forget it. Mrs. Banks asked me out for tea anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison slammed the remote down on the table. you actually brain-dead? The Banks family&#39;s barely hanging on, all because they pissed off Megan. And you&#39;re still cozying up to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re just fishing for info. If you think you can outplay Megan-or Tristan-go for it. But even women outside the family have more brains than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he grabbed his suit and stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn kicked the coffee table in frustration and burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly where Harrison had gone-to another woman, again. What had she done to deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Evelyn, Pearl was at least a bit sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could read the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina was eating lunch while chatting. &#34;I actually really like Megan. She&#39;s got guts, doesn&#39;t fake it. That aunt of ours has always been nasty-Mom,you really should stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she gave her mom a serious look. &#34;And don&#39;t pull any stunts, okay? I don&#39;t want things to get awkward between me and Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearl shot her daughter a side-eye. &#34;Hey, what kind of thing are you saying? When have I ever been that kind of person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better not be. Just stop with the whispering chats with auntie and third aunt. If I catch you again,I&#39;m done talking to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how firmly Lina stood by Megan, Pearl immediately adjusted her tone. No way she was going to stand against the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, sweetie. I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian added with a grin, &#34;Looks like the whole family&#39;s shifting gears.&#34;</p>
