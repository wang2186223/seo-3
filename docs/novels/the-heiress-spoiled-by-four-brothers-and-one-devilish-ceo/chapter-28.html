                <p>The main gate of Meridian University was still a ways off from the main building, and a leafy path stretched out between.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fifteen minutes left before class, Megan and Rachel took their time, strolling slowly under the dappled sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Meg,&#34; Rachel leaned in with a grin,三didn&#39;t get the chance yesterday-what made you switch gears all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan offered a soft smile. &#34;I had this dream. in it, Tristan died for me. It felt too real to ignore.When I woke up, I started thinking back to everything he&#39;s done. He wasn&#39;t trying to control me, he just. cared too much.I realized I misjudged him. I&#39;m ready now-to understand him, to accept him. and to love him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked, dumbfounded. &#34;You&#39;re telling me a dream flipped the switch? That&#39;s wild. Maybe if the Lee family all dreamed I saved their lives, they&#39;d finally treat me better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave her shoulder a gentle pat. &#34;Relationships are about two people. But marriage in families like ours? It&#39;s all politics. Sure, getting their blessing is nice, but don&#39;t let it weigh you down too much. In families like this, love&#39;s usually the first casualty. Don&#39;t sweat the Lee family. They don&#39;t matter. Someday, when Kai&#39;s got his footing, no matter who you are, they&#39;ll have to respect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded, a bit more at ease now.She suddenly looped her arm through Megan&#39;s, leaned close,and whispered wickedly, &#34;So. last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flicked her right on the forehead. &#34;Get your head out of the gutter. It&#39;s all polatonic right now..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel hissed in fake pain, rubbing her forehead while mumbling, &#34;UJgh, don&#39;t tell me my brother&#39;s.incapable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot her an eye-roll. Not like she could admnit her arm was still sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the steps of the main building, three girls abruptly blocked their path. &#34;Oh wow, look who it is-Miss Dumped-by-Reid herself,&#34; sneered Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you go on leave or something? Got the nerve toshow up to class again?&#34; added Jeanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, if it were me, I&#39;d be too embarrassed to show my face,&#34; chimed Erin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned to Rachel. &#34;Do you hear barking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel fanned the air in front of her nose. &#34;Not just rabid barking. but it reeks. Like something crawled in their mouths and died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan clicked her tongue in mock sympathy. &#34;Guess it&#39;s true-old habits die hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian shot her a finger. &#34;You bitch! Who are you calling that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever&#39;s been snacking on crap, obviously,&#34; Megan&#39;s smile was ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Rachel made to walk past the trio, brushing off the taunts. But Lillian wasn&#39;t done-she lunged forward, fingers aimed at Megan&#39;s black hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Big mistake. Megan&#39;s leg shot out and nailed her square in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shriek, Lillian toppled back onto the ground, a dark shoe print smacked right across her pale cheek.She shot a glance at Jeanie and Erin. &#34;Useless. Get over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two exchanged uneasy looks-none of them dared to move, terrified they&#39;d be the next to get a shoeprint slapped on their face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a mocking scoff. &#34;Calling you dogs would be an insult to actual dogs. I don&#39;t even know who you are, so stop trying so hard to get attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian felt completely disregarded. No matter what, she and Megan had at least been classmates. Saying she didn&#39;t know her? That was a slap in the face, screaming she was a forgettable nobody. That stung worse than an actual hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You act like you&#39;re above everyone!&#34; she snapped. &#34;Think you&#39;re all that now, huh? Pretending you don&#39;t know anyone?&#34; Megan tilted her head and stared at her coolly. &#34;Ever heard of garbage sorting? I&#39;m human; you&#39;re trash. No reason for me to know what bin you belong in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she nonchalantly walked off into the teaching building, Rachel by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two entered Room 413, the lively chatter instantly died. All eyes landed on Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the center of the classroom sat Molly. Her eyes were clear and innocent, and she looked up at Megan with a seemingly harmless smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the back row had open seats. Megan and Rachel walked up the steps toward the last row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right behind them, Lillian and her crew strutted in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a few snide female voices piped up:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some people get dumped and somehow the whole country hears about it. Embarrassing much? And she still has the nerve to show up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heard she clawed her way into some old guy&#39;s bed.Sounds about right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally shameless,honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the whispers, a few disgusting male voices joined in:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t believe l used to think she looked pure. Turns out she&#39;s just trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, if I&#39;d known she was such easy pickings, I&#39;d have made a move too. Who knows how many times she&#39;s been passed around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if she&#39;s that cheap, she&#39;s just a toy now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not scared of getting AIDS? Damn, got some real twisted tastes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But hey, if it&#39;s free, why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,lol...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s fists clenched tight-she was just about ready to beat some sense into them. It was clear they were spewing filth just to smear Megan&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, still clutching her slapped cheek, let out a low laugh. This show was too satisfying to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strutted past Megan with a sneer. &#34;Different people, different views. But your dirty laundry&#39;s out for everyone to see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had already mentally marked the gossiping trash talkers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she took off her backpack and handed it to Rachel. &#34;Hold this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she calmly stepped down two levels and pointed at three sleazy-looking guys. &#34;You. You. And you.Out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guys stared at Megan&#39;s gorgeous face, their expressions turning lewd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them smirked and shot back, &#34;Wat, this gonna be a live show or something?&#34;Megan curved her lips into a subtle smile and tapped on the desk of the guy with thick glasses. &#34;You. Open the alumni site and start a livestream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy looked nervous and tried to reason with her. &#34;Megan, don&#39;t do this to yourself. Let them say whatever they want. Don&#39;t bother with it so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three boys snapped at him, &#34;You wanna die, four-eyes?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s chill about it and you&#39;re still whining?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Keep yapping and I&#39;ll knock your teeth out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy stubbornly averted his gaze, like even if they beat him half-dead, he still wouldn&#39;t cave to this kind of shady stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,out of nowhere, one of the guys-bleached blond with a cocky swagger-swung his fist straight at the glasses boy&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34; A loud scream echoed across the huge classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t the glasses boy who cried out-it was the blond guy. Megan had punched him right in the wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole arm started trembling like crazy. &#34;Damn it! Get her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy with glasses stared in disbelief, adjusting his frames like he couldn&#39;t make sense of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s voice was like ice. &#34;Start the livestream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled to open the app, hurried to a good spot, and began filming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steadied the camera just in time to watch Megan grab another guy by the collar and jab her fingers into his eyes with deadly precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a swift spin, she kicked another dude straight in the side of the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the bleached blond, he didn&#39;t dare take another step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a cold laugh, lunged forward, and socked him square in the face. He dropped like a sack of bricks, nose bleeding all over the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could believe this serene-looking girl with soft black waves and fairy-like features had just won a full-on classroom brawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped hard on bleached blond&#39;s şhirt, her tone icy. &#34;Next time you wanna talk trash, I&#39;ll ship you to the landfill myself. They&#39;ve got shredders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sharp gaze swept toward the three girls near the window-the same ones who&#39;d been stirring up drama earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lifted her chin a notch. &#34;Need me to do it, or you gonna handle yourselves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls were completely frozen, gulping hard, heads shaking like bobbleheads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan held up her fingers, making a scissor gesture. &#34;Slap yourselves. Or I&#39;Il save you the trouble.&#34; Grimacing, they gave themselves a couple weak slaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all you&#39;ve got?&#34; Megan&#39;s voice cut through like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the loud &#34;smack, smack&#34; echoing through the room as the girls really started hitting themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down their faces. &#34;Is... is that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan crossed her arms, eyes like frosted glass, her words sharp as frostbite. &#34;Twenty each. Don&#39;t cheat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them sobbed while slapping themselves, trying to drag it out long enough for the teacher to show up and save them from the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when the sharp click of high heels echoed from the corridor.</p>
