                <p>The bleached-blond punk suddenly jerked awake, stumbled to his feet, and whipped out a fruit knife,charging at them like a lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The robot dog was compact and packed with features, but that came at a cost-its tranquilizer darts only worked for about five minutes tops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, during that brief moment Megan and the others were talking, the bleached-blond punk had already come to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a beeline for Megan and Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to reach them, Megan was yanked to the side into a warm embrace, while Amelia got shoved to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bleached-blond punk missed his mark and staggered forward, blinking rapidly, trying to keep his focus.Then,he turned and lunged at Megan again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel let go of Megan, raised his leg, and cleanly kicked the fruit knife out of The bleached-blond punk&#39;s hand. Without even pausing, he landed a hard punch to the guy&#39;s face, knocking him out cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Megan. &#34;You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, she was a little thrown off by what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean, this guy didn&#39;t think twice before shielding a complete stranger but knocked his own sister aside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny her own charm had something to do with it, but still... poor Amelia, having such a flaky brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that Megan needed help, anyway. She was totally capable of handling things herself. What a guy-meddling where he&#39;s not even needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amella just stared at her brother, her pretty eyes glassy with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie helped her up. &#34;Are you hurt, Amelia? Seriously, what&#39;s up with your brother? Why push you aside just to protect Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia blinked back the tears and forced out, &#34;I&#39;m fine. The guy was aiming for Megan, so she was in more danger.My brother made the right call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie muttered under her breath, &#34;Yeah, but you&#39;re his sister. Shouldn&#39;t that count for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia lowered her eyes, her arms limp at her sides. If she really was his sister...wouldn&#39;t he have chosen to protect her first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, three police cars pulled up at the edge of the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three officers stepped out of each vehicle, rounding up the bleached-blond punk and the two other guys who had gotten violent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else was told to follow them back to the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,high up in the executive office on the 88th floor of the Reid Corporation, Tristan looked cold and composed as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes locked on the red dot moving across the map on his phone screen-he&#39;d started tracking it as soon as Megan left Meridian University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw it stop for a brief fifteen-minute window at Benevita Hospital before returning to the university, and then darting out again, only to finally halt at the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first,he&#39;d tried to piece together why she was at the hospital. But once he saw she ended up at the police station, he could no longer sit still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare to call her right away either-she was sharp, and if he pushed too hard, she&#39;d definitely figure out he&#39;d planted a tracker on her. Just as he was chewing over what to do, the police called to inform him to come get &#34;his person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan grabbed his suit jacket and walked out of the office without another word. Cameron quickly followed,calling out, &#34;Mr. Reid, the executive meeting starts in five minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s tone turned icy, &#34;Push it to tomorrow.n</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching as the doors to the CEO&#39;s private elevator slid shut, Cameron muttered under his breath,&#34;Figures.That drama queen must be acting up again. Even a falling sky wouldn&#39;t shake Mr. Reid, but now look-he&#39;s totally under her spell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Pingdu Police Station, a sleek black Bentley drifted neatly to a stop at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a crisp motion, Tristan opened the door and strode in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chief Ford personally came out to greet him. &#34;Mr. Reid, you&#39;re here. Your wife is giving her statement in the interrogation room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan paused. &#34;Interrogation room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chief Ford hesitated for a beat. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of place is where you put my woman?&#34; Tristan pulled out his phone. &#34;Linus, where the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here! Just walked in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps:echoed as Linus jogged over,sweating profusely.&#34;S-sorry, Mr. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot him a chilling glance. &#34;Do that again, and you better not show your face around me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linus sucked in a breath. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Megan stepped out of the interrogation room. Her eyes lit up as she ran into the tall man&#39;s embrace. &#34;Babe, you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan wrapped his arms around her, genty patting her back.sover now. Let&#39;s go home. Linus will handle the rest.&#34; He turned to Linus. &#34;I told you to come down hard on him. How did that guy even get another chance to pull a knife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linus&#39;s expression froze-seriously? It was just a fight yesterday, and the guy had gotten beat up. How was he supposed to go overboard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today was different. The guy had come armed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linus promised firmly, &#34;Don&#39;t worTy, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Samuel walked out of another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused when he saw the couple hugging, then flashed a slight smnile.&#34;Mr.Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a small nod. &#34;Thanks for stepping in, Mr. Lewis. If you need anything, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel responded calmly, &#34;It was nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched Tristan walk away with Megan in his arms, his gaze darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sam!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sweet voice called out as he turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia and Natalie were approaching. Amelia smiled up at himn. &#34;Sam, join us for dinner tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His polite smile faded into indifference. &#34;Can&#39;t. Got other plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pouted and clung to Amelia&#39;s arm. &#34;Jeez. Your brother&#39;s like a block of ice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced in the direction he&#39;d left. &#34;Though, he wasn&#39;t that cold with Megan. Suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tch. That Megan sure is something...Always snagging attention wherever she goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia kept her eyes on Samuel&#39;s retreating figure, voice soft, &#34;Natalie, do you think Megan kind of.looks like my brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie squinted, trying to picture their faces. &#34;Huh! You know what. There is something there.&#34;Amelia raised an eyebrow. &#34;Those eyes... don&#39;t they look kinda familiar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rubbed her chin thoughtfully. &#34;You know what, now that you mention it-they really do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange glint flashed in Amelia&#39;s eyes, just a flicker of red deep down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, after walking out of the police station, Samuel slid into his Aston Martin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t drive off right away. Instead, he pulled out his laptop from his backpack and opened it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His account really was short by a zero today-thirty million turned into just three mil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The culprit? A notorious, sleazy hacking tool called &#34;Fortune Leech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nasty little invention courtesy of Blackwing, a hacker who made Samuel grit his teeth in frustration every time he heard the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the program is activated, it sucks a zero off any account within five meters from the user-doesn&#39;t matter how much money is in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To this day, no one&#39;s been able to crack it. Not even him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blackwing was clever, twisted, and seemed to have no moral compass whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel had never lost battles in the cyber world.except to Blackwing. Over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For,a while, things had been peaceful. Blackwing disappeared six months ago, and Samuel had finally been able to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But yesterday, a massive deal landed on his desk-ten million on the line. And guess who swooped in,snatched it, and gave it away for free?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep.Blackwing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blood was still boiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t even about the cash anymore-the guy had stomped all over his rep. He was supposed to be the god of hacking, the best of the best. And now? Overshadowed by/a cockroach hiding in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-today of all days-Samuel spotted that same cursed program on some random girl&#39;s device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan Shaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a hunch there was a link between her and Blackwing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, she might be the key to tracking him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why he asked for her number-looking for a trail to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His slender fingers danced across the keyboard, window after window of code popping up as he dove into the bank system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He typed in Megan&#39;s phone number, hoping to unlock account info-maybe find ties to a familiar bank account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nope. Everything was blocked. Her data was locked behind an ironclad firewall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried pulling up random accounts to check. No problem at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, that confirmed it-Megan&#39;s profile alone was heavily protected. That firewall wasn&#39;t standard; that beast was tailor-made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel smirked. Now this was getting interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get any direct info, sure. But that one clue said plenty-someone powerful was shielding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the likely suspect? Blackwing. He was the only one Samuel had ever lost to. So yeah, Megan wasn&#39;t just some average girl. Also, yeah, the phone number wasn&#39;t just about the hack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the eyes.Those bright, familiar eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Brandon, I found a girl whose eyes seriously look just like mine. What if she&#39;s our long-lost sister?&#34; A lazy voice answered, &#34;Here we go again. Quit daydreaming, man. I&#39;m busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel froze.&#34;...You&#39;re kidding me...</p>
