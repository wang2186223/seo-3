                <p>The silver moonlight was swallowed by the clouds again, and a chilly drizzle had started to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gripped her M9 tightly, eyes sweeping around with caution. She took a step back, only to feel something cold and hard press against her lower back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t dare to move-if the idiot behind her pulled the trigger, that&#39;d be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clean death was one thing. What she couldn&#39;t bear was ending up paralyzed-alive,but barely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raindrops clung to her thick lashes, trembling as she blinked. The icy wetness trailed down her pale cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An arm suddenly slid around her collarbone,locking onto her shoulder. A wave of warm breath brushed against her neck. &#34;Scared?&#34; a familiar, seductive voice murmured close to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes darted sideways in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then soft lips pressed against hers, warm tongue slipping past her teeth, boldly claiming space that once belonged only to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs turned to jelly, and the metallic taste of blood hit her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, she tried pushing him away. &#34;You&#39;re hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a scratch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Tristan and caught him before he lost his balance. He let out a low grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm came away wet and sticky. When she glanced at her hand, it was stained a darker shade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your left shoulder&#39;s bleeding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took a bullet. I&#39;m fine. They didn&#39;t make it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart clenched. She helped him up gently.&#34;We  need to find Chloe first, then I&#39;ll get you to a hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Nova Tech zoomed through the rain,circling anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its voice sounded rushed and high-pitched: &#34;Ugly woman&#39;s up! She&#39;s got the pretty girl now-took her hostage. I didn&#39;t goin, not sure I can pull this off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Tristan rushed back to the warehouse.They stepped inside to see Molly looking wild, gun aimed at Chloe&#39;s temple like a scene from hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of them, Molly laughed maniacally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to save her? Trade your life for hers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s cheeks were streaked with tears, but her stare was steady. She might be scared, but if saving herself meant losing her sister? No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on then-shoot me if you&#39;ve got the guts,&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly yanked Chloe&#39;s collar tight, making her face  flush. She hissed, &#34;None of you are getting out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slowly raised her hands, &#34;Molly, don&#39;t do this-I&#39;ll switch places with her. Just let her go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, her voice calm. &#34;There&#39;s no need for this. Let Chloe go-no police, I&#39;ll getyou out of the country.Deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move! I&#39;m not stupid-I know you&#39;ve trained in all that fight stuff. I can&#39;t win against you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly dragged Chloe back another step, eyes burning, &#34;You ruined me! You think I&#39;m walking away from this quietly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed her gun at Tristan now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-break her arms and legs. Or I blow her head off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s stare turned deadly cold. Something dangerous flickered in his eyes-rage, hatred...darkness. Megan had never seen him like this. He dragged his tongue slowly across his teeth and spat out,&#34;Keep dreaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly snapped, jamming the gun harder against Chloe&#39;s temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I won&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Tristan hurled his gun to the ground and stepped in front of Megan, shielding her with his whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me instead. Let them go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly broke into hysterics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, I never thought you&#39;d end up here. I begged for your attention, and you never looked my way! You made me suffer-now it&#39;s your turn to know what that feels like!&#34;She aimed the gun straight at Tristan, but just as her finger tightened on the trigger, a flash of blue light struck her index finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That trigger finger instantly burned as if scorched,and a gut-wrenching scream echoed through the factory ceiling.  With a swift move, Tristan lunged forward and kicked Molly several meters away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood gushed from Molly&#39;s mouth as she hunched over, clutching her stomach and curling her legs inward in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe bolted back and grabbed onto Megan&#39;s arm tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same moment, Nova Tech landed lightly on Megan&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Nova nailed the sneak attack!Nova rules, way better than that bonehead Zeta Prime!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. This silly thing really only liked to compete with Zeta Prime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently comforted Chloe, then walked over to Molly, now barely holding it together. &#34;I was ready to let this go, but you just kept pushing. Guess you&#39;ll be spending your days behind bars now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face was drenched in sweat, twisted in agony.Bloodshot eyes glared up at Megan with pure venom. &#34;You bitch...you&#39;ll rot in hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Molly began to writhe in pain, her fingernails digging deep into her own neck as blood streamed down her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she clutched at her chest and began vomiting blood violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan immediately sensed something was wrong.He pulled Megan close and stepped back a full meter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s body was jerking uncontrollably. Veins bulged at her temples, and her sclera turned a horrifying blood-red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-just like that-she stopped moving.Her chest no longer rose or fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s... dead?&#34; Megan murmured, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She genuinely didn&#39;t get it. How could just one kick from Tristan kill someone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes, filled with blood, stayed wide open-  locked on the factory roof above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tiny black object, the size of a bean, crawled out of her nostril.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as it spread its dark wings to take off, Nova snatched it midair at lightning speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova, don&#39;t squash it,&#34; Megan warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova let out a few concerned whines. &#34;Nova scanned it-this black bug&#39;s vitals are zero. It&#39;s already toast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova hovered over to Tristan and Megan, opening its paw to reveal the bug, now a splattered mess oozing dark fluid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Megan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan squinted. &#34;Looks like... a sorcery worm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran through Megan, goosebumps crawling over her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d heard whispers of sorcery worms being used to kill-but seeing it in real life was something else entirely. Brutal. Horrific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone vibrated. The call was from an unknown number again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered and switched to speaker. A distorted voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ike the little gift I sent you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was the point of sending Molly to kidnap Chloe?&#34; Megan asked, brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wanted you to have this present. And... maybe get a glimpse of you,&#34; the voice teased, the creepy flirtation in their tone impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s stomach turned. She was sure now-someone had been watching her, closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned the area, searching for any sign of surveillance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No use. You won&#39;t find me. But don&#39;t worry... we&#39;ll meet.Sooner or later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended. Megan let out a pissed sigh. &#34;Sick  freak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe asked, confused, &#34;Wait, does that person...like you or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face darkened at the idea. &#34;This is way more complicated than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan called the cops, and forty minutes later,police cars and ambulances arrived at the abandoned lot in the eastern suburbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right then, a man with blood-red eyes burst into the warehouse.</p>
