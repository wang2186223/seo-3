                <p>The spacious living room echoed with that one sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly instinctively glanced at the man casually leaning against the back of the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw was tight, eyes cold like a storm brewing under the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint curl of his lips, Tristan spoke slowly, &#34;I&#39;m curious-how exactly did you plan out this little drama of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Molly&#39;s eyes as she bit her lower lip till it turned pale, &#34;I didn&#39;t. I really didn&#39;t say or do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took a step forward, lowered herself slightly,and hooked a finger under Molly&#39;s chin. &#34;Memory that bad already? You&#39;re young, you know. Let me jog it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let go of Molly&#39;s chin and straightened up, arms behind her back. &#34;You kept getting in my head,painting Tristan as this possessive, selfish control freak.You wanted me scared of him, didn&#39;t you? Then you fed me the idea to ditch the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan continued, &#34;And just when I ran, conveniently,  a car was waiting. I was desperate, jumped in thinking I was safe, headed straight for the airport-but guess what? There was something in the scent inside the car.Knocked me out cold. Next thing I knew, I woke up to see Tristan. If he hadn&#39;t shown up when he did, I don&#39;t even want to think about what would&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly remembered exactly what she said to her back at the Dreamscape Manor-that it was Tristan&#39;s men who took her and dragged her back. And Megan used to believe every bit of it. So how did everything flip all of a sudden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t understand what changed. The driver wasn&#39;t supposed to spill-his whole family was under her thumb. But ever since Megan saw her the day before yesterday,she was totally different. She didn&#39;t trust her anymore. She believed Tristan now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone go from hating a guy to falling for him like flipping a switch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Molly&#39;s face as she sobbed like she&#39;d just endured the worst injustice on Earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the sofa&#39;s armrest. &#34;Tell me-what do you think I should do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes widened in panic. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything terrible! This is al a misunderstanding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled toward Elliot, grabbing onto his pant leg. &#34;Dad, please, believe me! You and Mom treated me like l was your own. How could I ever betray that?&#34; Elliot&#39;s brows furrowed deeply. &#34;Molly, you&#39;re nineteen now. You&#39;re an adult. You need to learn to stand on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her crying stopped abruptly. &#34;Dad. what are you saying?Are you kicking me out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot let out a slow, tired sigh. &#34;I&#39;ll buy you an apartment near the university. It&#39;s time you moved out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lifted a brow slightly. &#34;Molly, your time as the second miss of the Shaw family is over. A crow won&#39;t become a swan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sank to her knees, utterly crushed, like the air had been sucked out of her world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t figure out-where did everything go wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did the idiot who used to hang onto her every word suddenly slip away from her control?Megan walked right up to her, tilted her head with a faint smirk, and said, &#34;See you Monday at school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;School?&#34; Molly mumbled, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled sweetly. &#34;I&#39;m really looking forward to being classmates again.&#34; Oh, the show&#39;s just getting started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and strolled back to Tristan&#39;s side. &#34;Babe,let&#39;s go. No need to let garbage ruin our mood.We just registered today-shouldn&#39;t we celebrate a little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stood up, straightened his coat sleeve, then took her hand gently. Facing Diane Hartwell and Elliot, he gave a respectful bow. &#34;Megan and I got married today.From now on, we&#39;re family. If there&#39;s anything you need, just let me know-l&#39;ll do everything I can.We&#39;re planning to have the wedding on Megan&#39;s birthday. We&#39;ve still got plans today, so we won&#39;t stay long. If you miss Megan, you&#39;re always welcome at Dreamscape Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he took Megan&#39;s hand and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot, Diane, and Chloe followed to see them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned to glance back at them. Then, with a quick look to Tristan, she said, &#34;Hang on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried back and wrapped both Diane and Chloe in a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long moment, she looked at them with watery eyes and whispered, &#34;I&#39;m really happy to see you both again.&#34; This time, I&#39;ll protect you no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Elliot a small smile before walking back toward the man waiting patiently for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slipped an arm around her waist and whispered,&#34;You skipped hugging your dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked up with a teasing smile. &#34;Thought you might get jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;Jealous? Of your dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Then why&#39;s his name mysteriously missing from my contacts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan coughed lightly. &#34;Maybe I. accidentally deleted it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow. &#34;Want me to go hug him now to make up for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could move, he quickly pulled her into the car,opened the passenger door, and settled her in.Then he walked around and got into the driver&#39;s seat.They drove off into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the door,Molly leaned against the frame,nails digging into her palms so hard they almost pierced skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected Megan to flip the script on her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That useless girl-how dare she act all high and mighty now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit down so hard her veneer cracked, lashes trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swore she&#39;d make Megan pay-pay so bad she&#39;d wish she were dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the three of them walk towards her,her eyes filled with tears within seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad.Mom.Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot just let outa heavy sigh and walked right past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane shot her a frosty glare. &#34;Still here after everything you did? Got some nerve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe flicked a strand of Molly&#39;s hair and clicked her tongue. &#34;Molly, next time you see us, maybe try a detour. And drop the &#39;Shaw family heiress&#39; label,yeah?You don&#39;t deserve it.&#34;She took a few steps forward,turned her head, and said coldly, &#34;Take everything that&#39;s yours and leave the rest alone. Don&#39;t go sticking your hands where they don&#39;t belong-like coveting someone else&#39;s man. That kind of dream? Not happening in this lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she gave a scoff, her twin ponytails bouncing as she turned and climbed the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes narrowed like a venomous serpent&#39;s,their darkness laced with hatred. She absolutely loathed everyone in this family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, she wanted them to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially that little one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So pretty,huh? She was going to ruin that face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach was parked on the coastal highway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan halted their beach stroll, waves kissing the shore as he turned Megan to face him. His hand dipped into his pocket, retrieving not a box, but a slender velvet pouch. Kneeling in the sand, the sunset gilding the sharp planes of his face, he poured its contents into his palm: a platinum necklace, its pendant a single diamond suspended like a captured star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wry smile touched his lips. &#34;Cliché? Maybe. But nothing else felt worthy of this moment.&#34; His thumb brushed the cool stone. &#34;I bought this the week after we met. Knew then-you were the one I&#39;d spend lifetimes finding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you ran from the engagement...&#34; His voice roughened. &#34;I thought I&#39;d lost the right to ever put this around your neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted the chain, the diamond catching fire in the dying light. &#34;Thank you for letting me finally bringit home. Megan Reid... thank you for choosing me.l swear my life to loving you, protecting you,holding you closer than my own breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears glistened on Megan&#39;s lashes as she smiled.She swept her hair aside, exposing the vulnerable curve of her neck. &#34;My honor,&#34; she whispered. &#34;And my vow to guard your heart as fiercely.&#34; This time, I won&#39;t fail you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan fastened the clasp, his fingers lingering against her skin. Then he drew a smaller pouch from his pocket. Inside lay two delicate braided bracelets, one slightly wider than the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow,&#34; he murmured, securing the slender bracelet around her wrist, &#34;when you&#39;re on campus..this won&#39;t shout like the necklace might.&#34; He traced the intertwined &#39;T&amp;M&#39;s woven into the design.&#34;Our mark.Always with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took the wider bracelet. Her fingers brushed his pulse point as she clasped it around his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached up,whisking away a strand of hair from her face, thumb brushing lightly over her cheek.&#34;Megan, I love you. From the moment I saw you,l knew it had to be you-forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, smiling, &#34;And when exactly was that first time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He traced her bottom lip with his thumb, the memory clear in his mind-her, breathless in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled softly. &#34;A long, long time ago... You already had a place in my heart back then.&#34;</p>
