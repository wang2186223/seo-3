                <p>Early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan opened her sleepy eyes, Tristan was already staring at her without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, she quickly tugged the thin blanket up to cover her blushing face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that. My face&#39;s gonna turn into a tomato.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her half-joking voice, Tristan reached out to gently tug the blanket down. &#34;Come on, let me see how red it really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a soft huff and rolled to the edge of the bed before hopping down. &#34;Enough flirting, I&#39;m going to wash up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stuck her tongue out and dashed into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at herself in the mirror, her neck, collarbones, and even her soft, fair skin were all marked in red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, are you a werewolf or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much foundation do I need to cover this up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After washing up, she walked out and took a seat at her vanity, starting her skincare routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned lazily against the headboard, admiring the doll-like girl reflected in the mirror. His heart was totally full just watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting the blanket, he got out of bed and made his way over with his long strides, leaning against the vanity casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Megan applied primer, she looked up, &#34;Aren&#39;t you gonna get ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan grinned, &#34;Already did. Want proof? Come taste the mint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, he leaned in and kissed her lightly. He brushed the tip of her nose with a fingertip. &#34;Well? Do you believe me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s lips curled into a smile as she looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her lipstick case, rows of different colors and brands-hundreds of them-were laid out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick one for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at her flawless skin. Honestly, any shade would work-even those &#39;danger zones&#39; most people couldn&#39;t pull off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked out a cherry blossom pink. &#34;Let me do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes lit up as she tilted her head toward him, ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of applying it the normal way, Tristan swiped it over his own lips first, then leaned in and kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes flew open at the warm touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pulling away, he smiled smugly. &#34;Done. If you don&#39;t like it, I can redo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked in the mirror, pouting at the soft pink color. &#34;Seriously? That&#39;s how you put on lipstick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reid Style,&#34; Tristan said seriously. &#34;And I&#39;m a pro in more areas than one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he mean what she thought he meant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about the night before-doing everything but that one final step-Megan blushed so hard it reached her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was racing like crazy. She jumped up and ran toward the walk-in closet while tossing out,&#34;1&#34;m getting dressed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her flee shyly, Tristan couldn&#39;t help the smile tugging athis lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then went to the other room to change clothes too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a white tee, jeans, and slightly worn sneakers, Megan packed a new listening device, stun gun, and some medical supplies into her bag before heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan was leaning against the closet door, freshly dressed in a tailored black suit. Tall, elegant, and downright irresistible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw her, he pulled her into his arms right away. &#34;Maybe I should renovate the wardrobe. Make it big enough for the both of us next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked, a little confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, warm breath brushing her neck. &#34;Then we can get dressed together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip and gave his chest a playful jab. &#34;You&#39;re such a perv.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His low chuckle rumbled close to her ea. &#34;Might need to reapply that lipstick, babe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her watch. &#34;Come on, I&#39;m gonna be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan finally let her go and followed her downstairs for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating, they each got into their cars and drove out of Dreamscape Manor.Tristan&#39;s car kept a steady distance behind Megan&#39;s all the way to the front gate of Meridian University. Only after watching her arrive safely did he merge into traffic and drive off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Rachel was taking their aunt in for a checkup today, Megan didn&#39;t need to wait for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already agreed to meet Chloe at the school gate to hand her the stun gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a Rolls-Royce pulled up behind her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe hopped out, and right after, came Kevin-apparently now her personal chauffeur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe slid into the passenger seat of Megan&#39;s car, a sweet smile tugging at the dimples on her cheeks.&#34;Morning, Meg!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin ran a hand through his overly styled hair and bent slightly to greet her.&#34;Hey,Meg! Morning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grin on his face couldn&#39;t scream &#34;wannabe her brother-in-law&#34; any louder. Megan pulled the stun gun from her bag and handed it over, walking Chloe through how to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Kevin, who was lingering by the car, and said loudly, &#34;If he tries anything sketchy, don&#39;t even hesitate.Shock him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin:[So.this thing is for me? Are you kidding me?/(T o T)/~~]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe nodded seriously. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, sis, I won&#39;t go easy on him! Alright, I&#39;m off then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small nod. &#34;Lunch together later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe chuckled. &#34;Ha! Goofball Bro&#39;s taking me to a Michelin-starred place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yup, just as she expected-this girl&#39;s got zero resistance when it comes to food and fluff talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Kevin guide Chloe across the street, Megan couldn&#39;t help but think he looked like a wannabe sugar daddy escorting a baby-faced girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh.Creepy much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan drove into the campus and parked near the main academic building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her bag, got out, and headed toward the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OMG, look at that Maybach-license plate ends in 888! That&#39;s gotta be Tristan&#39;s ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally! No wonder someone dropped a fortune building that new library.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moral of the story? Don&#39;t even think about messing with that chick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard what happened yesterday? Nine families linked to people who messed with her got dragged into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I know! Lillian&#39;s dad even begged my old man for help. Why would anyone go up against Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fearful murmurs floated around-though, as always, someone just couldn&#39;t help stirring the pot. &#34;Pfft, what&#39;s the big deal? Look at her. Nine out of ten, she&#39;s just great in bed. Otherwise, no way she&#39;d still be hanging onto Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey now, be nice. Everyone&#39;s got something good about them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned her head slightly and gave the girl who made the first comment a sharp look. &#34;Hey, green hair-your wrist all healed up? Wanna try the other one next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie recoiled like a startled cat, hiding her hands behind her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a soft scoff. &#34;Scared now, huh? Maybe keep that mouth shut next time-or things could get way worse for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she looked over at the other girl: Amelia Lewis, daughter of the Lewis family in Lindon City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t like her.People usually hung out with those who were like them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Amelia and Natalie were close, then Megan figured she was trouble too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia smiled politely and gave a nod. &#34;Hey, Megan. I&#39;m Amelia. There&#39;s a lecture later-wanna sit together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suddenly looked like a kid abandoned at recess, silently fuming, her lips pressed tight and jealousy flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, all the seats near me are taken. No room for extras. And if you keep talking to me, your little follower over there might just explode from jealousy-her eyesare practically glowing green.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie flushed red and clenched her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not jealous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rubbed her chin, thinking about Kai-how he was betrothed to Natalie but clearly had a thing for Rachel instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically speaking... that did count as cheating, didn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at Natalie, who looked like she was about to combust. Megan let out a soft laugh.</p>
