                <p>The moment the piece was revealed, everyone&#39;s eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing pristine white gloves, Jayne picked up a heart -shaped diamond, completely clear without the slightest imperfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here comes the highlight of the night-&#39;Heart of the Ocean&#39;!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This IF-grade, entirely flawless diamond is as rare as it gets-top-notch brilliance, fire, and sparkle like no other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,which generous soul&#39;s gonna walk away with this seven-carat masterpiece?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting bid-10 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;25 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;30 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;35 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;100 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan jumped in with a number that doubled the last in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;150 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice echoed out from Suite No.4 on the third floor. Tristan smirked. &#34;200 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;250 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;300 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;350 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan said,&#34;500 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went wild. Even the host was barely holding back his excitement-this was a record-breaking price in diamond auction history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five billion going once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going twice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sold at five billion to the kind bidder in Suite No.1 on the third floor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently took Megan&#39;s hand and kissed it.&#34;D0you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted slightly. &#34;Sure, it&#39;s stunning. But isn&#39;t it a bit over the top?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her into his arms with a chuckle. &#34;What&#39;s the point of making money if not to spend it on you?Trust me, babe, I make it faster than you can spend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of big-spender romance move would melt just about any girl&#39;s heart, and Megan wasn&#39;t immune to it this time either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though what she really wanted to know was-who was that persistent bidder trying to compete with her man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t take long to find out, actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayne brought out the final item of the night-a  necklace featuring a top-grade blue diamond, straight out of South Africa. Starting bid: one hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan hit her mic button, her voice sweet as ever.&#34;100 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd had learned by now-Suite No.1 didn&#39;t shout empty bids. So, nobody else bothered stepping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan glanced at her, amused. &#34;Wow, must really like this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s lips curved into a playful smile. &#34;Like it? Love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right on cue, Suite No.4 threw in:0 million!&#34;&#34;300 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan: &#34;500 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suite No.4: &#34;600 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stopped bidding, a pleased smirk playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit Tristan-this girlwasn&#39;t trying to win the necklace.She was getting even for earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;600 million, going once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going twice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sold at 600 million to the generous bidder in Suite No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>4 on the third floor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pressed the mic again. &#34;Such a generous soul in Suite No.4, setting a new price record for a single piece! We&#39;d love to know who&#39;s behind such a heartfelt donation-any chance we could get a peek?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, over in Suite No.4-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pfft!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel burst out laughing, tears streaming down his face.&#34;Bro, that backfired hard! Tried to mess with her,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason ground his teeth. &#34;Shut it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel wiped away his tears, still snickering. &#34;No joke though,that girl scammed me too. She knows that old thief from Blackwing.Scammed 27 mil straight from my account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason looked mildly comforted hearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh. and you let it slide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel shrugged. &#34;She kinda looks like me. Figured I&#39;d let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you?&#34;Hearing that, Samuel perked up.&#34;You don&#39;t get it, that girl Megan-her eyes? Total copy of mine. Even her features look kinda like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason frowned slightly, looking unimpressed. &#34;If she looks like you, she must be hideous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel clicked his tongue. &#34;Seriously? Would Tristan fall for someone ugly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason looked down thoughtfully. He might tease, but deep down he knew-if someone could resemble his fourth brother, then she had to be a real stunner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think she could be our lost sister?&#34; Samuel asked  suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason flicked his forehead. &#34;You&#39;ve said that about half the girls in the city already. You made Kevin run countless DNA tests-none matched. Every time some girl barely resembles you, you&#39;re off chasing some theory again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel pouted, &#34;Fine, fine, I&#39;ll stop. Geez,my genius brain deserves more respect than forehead pokes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot him a cold glance. &#34;Genius? You got outdone by Blackwing more times than I can count,and you still think you&#39;re a prodigy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a staff member knocked on the door,informing them it was time to go on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two walked down toward the auction platform,they saw Tristan, Megan, Kai, and others already up there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason&#39;s eyes lit up. There was no denying it-Megan really did resemble Samuel. Especially those sly, fox-like eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wow, it wasn&#39;t just Samuel-those eyes were dead ringers for their mother, Stella Banks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan noticed the way Jason was staring at Megan and his expression darkened instantly, like he wanted to wrap her up and hide her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That icy stare of his made Jason and Samuel quickly shift their gazes elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They climbed the stage and waited for the host to  present their winnings and ask for brief charity remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the center of the hall, four women were whispering among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna Cooper looked toward Natalie. &#34;Wow, Natalie,I&#39;m sooo jealous! Kai just blew two hundred million on jewelry for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie forced a tight smile. &#34;Yeah, I wasn&#39;t expecting that either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t sound convincing though-because honestly,she and Kai had barely spoken five full sentences.The guy&#39;s cold attitude made him feel light-years away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna leaned in eagerly. &#34;So, when&#39;s the engagement party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie coughed lightly. &#34;That&#39;s up to our families to arrange. I&#39;m not sure yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica Lunnon,always eagle-eyed, chimed in. &#34;Hey,look over there. Kai&#39;s been staring at that girl near the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie followed Jessica&#39;s gaze-and spotted Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly cracked a molar from clenching her teeth.That freaking adopted daughter of the Reids was seriously trying to steal her man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If looks could kill, Rachel would&#39;ve been vaporized on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna gasped, covering her mouth. &#34;Oh my god,Natalie,you think the jewelry was actually for her?&#34;  Natalie&#39;s face went from red to pale in seconds. She muttered something about needing the restroom and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna and Jessica shared a smug giggle before turning to Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia,your brothers Samuel and Jason are on stage too! The Lewis family really is top-tier in Lindon City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With powerhouse families like the Reids and Lewises,no wonder they&#39;re winning bids left and right. That necklace will be yours, for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Amelia knew better. Jason and Samuel would never give her something that expensive-she wasn&#39;t their real sister, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before they found out the truth, they&#39;d never really been close to her. Now that they knew? Forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her voice soft. &#34;A necklace like that? It&#39;s probably going to our mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna looked at her, eyes full of admiration.&#34;You&#39;re the only girl in your family, right? Your brothers must dote on you endlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica sighed with a dreamy look. &#34;Four brothers...Man, I&#39;d settle for just one. Honestly, just give me Jason and I&#39;d be good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two kept chatting excitedly about the four Lewis brothers, each exaggerating more than the last.No one noticed the brief flicker of gloom in Amelia&#39;s  eyes.</p>
