                <p>Megan ducked under the bald man&#39;s swinging arm and with lightning speed, slipped behind him. Grabbing his shoulders, she kicked his lower back right at the spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, she ditched yoga for full-on Taekwondo and street fighting. Now a black belt, she knew exactly where to strike. The guy stumbled, smashed into the wall, and fell to his knees with blood spilling from his nose. &#34;Damn it, I think my back&#39;s broken!&#34; he howled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t pause. She darted forward and landed a solid left hook to his jaw. His body folded, head tilted,coughing out blood mixed with a couple of teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still defiant, the bald man slurred, &#34;Get her! Finish her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stiletto heel pinned down on his neck. Face cold as ice, Megan stared down at him like a demon from hell. &#34;Let the girl go, or l&#39;ll snap his neck right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four other creeps shot up from the couch, charging straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without blinking, Megan slammed her heel into the bald man&#39;s mouth-heel deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone threw a straight punch her way; she tilted her head slightly and yanked the guy&#39;s arm, flipping him over her back in a perfect shoulder throw. When another tried to grab her, she didn&#39;t hesitate-kicked him straight between the legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped to the floor with a twisted, pained exporession that practically screamed regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flashed a grin, &#34;I call that move &#39;Instant Egg Explosion&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last two tried a pincer move. She snatched one by the hair, ran up the wall, and chopped his neck with pinpointprecision. Bam-down he went, limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the final guy, she smirked, an eerie twinkle in her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon, you scared or just lazy?&#34; she taunted.He growled and lunged with a fist, only to freeze with it halted an inch from her porcelain face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, knees buckled inward, and he collapsed weirdly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan scoffed,&#34;That one&#39;s called &#39;Sad Songs for the Eggs&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peeling off the wraps from her hands, she strolled toward the couch, where Chloe lay unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned to see Tristan storm in with Kevin and Kai close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s sharp eyes scanned her torn dress, exposing those insanely long, perfect legs. Then he glanced at the guys groaning or knocked out cold across the room. His gaze darkened-calm surface, but fullof bloodlust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s mouth twitched. &#34;Uh... who did all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai and Rachel were too stunned to even speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one untouched soul in the room-who else could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next second, Megan ran into Tristan&#39;s arms with watery eyes and a trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, I was scared.&#34; she whispered against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conscious men on the floor: [You beat the crap out of us and you&#39;re the one scared?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently patted her back, his voice soft like coaxing a kid. &#34;It&#39;s okay. Tell me what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked innocently. &#34;I saw that bald guy dragging Chloe in here-she looked totally out of it.I panicked and followed. Then they all tried to... you know.I was scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Tristan slipped off his blazer and wrapped it around her to cover her exposed legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got this,&#34; he said gently, eyes still glinting with menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Kevin, voice low and commanding. &#34;Take them to the basement.&#34; The Prestige Club had been Tristan, Kevin, and Kai&#39;s joint project five years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the place? Absolutely zero tolerance for gambling, prostitution, or drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Break the rules, and you paid the price-painfully.Tonight, these five really hit a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely thirty seconds after Kevin made a call, ten security guards in black suits stormed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a turn of a hidden knob behind the couch, Kevin opened a concealed floor hatch-automatic sliding panels revealed a staircase leading underground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards dragged the five men down without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached over and gently ruffled Megan&#39;s hair. &#34;Kai will take you all to the guest suite on the seventh floor. I&#39;ll join you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Kai. &#34;Take them to the private room. Ask Max Adams to come check Chloe&#39;s condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai gave a small nod. &#34;Got it. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Tristan turned and descended into the underground passage, Kevin following right behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hidden floor panels slid shut again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai strode over to the couch and carefully lifted the petite Chloe into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel followed Kai out,heading to the seventh-floor suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai laid Chloe gently on the bed, then turned to Megan. &#34;Her breathing&#39;s steady. Looks like she was just drugged. I&#39;ll get Max to double-check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel plopped down on the edge of the bed. &#34;Megan, who&#39;s this girl you risked everything for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my little sister, Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While replying, Megan opened a nearby backpack and pulled out a phone. Over a dozen missed calls-all from Diane Hartwell. Megan figured her mom must be panicking. She quickly tapped call back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chloe! Where have you been? I&#39;ve called like a million times and no answer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, it&#39;s Megan. Chloe&#39;s with me. We were dancing just now, didn&#39;t hear the phone. She will come back to Dreamscape with me tonight, so don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane let out a breath. &#34;Next time, let Mom know first. You scared me half to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small chuckle. &#34;My bad, Mom. I&#39;Il make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I know you just got your marriage registered today, but don&#39;t stay out too late, okay? It&#39;s your wedding night,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan coughed lightly. &#34;Uh-Mom, gotta go, talk later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up in a flash, terrified her mom would say something even crazier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, are you blushing?&#34; Rachel stared at her with sparkling eyes. &#34;Butto be fair, what Auntie said checks out. Even without a ceremony, technically... tonight&#39;s your wedding night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, oozing curiosity. &#34;Come on, be honest-is it already happening between you and Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised her brows and gave Rachel a gentle flick on the forehead. &#34;Rachel, what sort of nonsense is filling that head of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her, Megan started checking Chloe&#39;s recent contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One unfamiliar number caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called it, only to hear: disconnected number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, looks like the real answer would have to wait until Chloe regained consciousness-or maybe that bald guy in the basement would cough up something useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,in the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five men dropped to their knees in a row-two of them slouching strangely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were clearly in pain, but none dared make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept sneaking glances toward the leather sofa, where two men sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them? The legendary Tristan, known widely across the country. Ruthless in the boardroom-deadier outside of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other? Kevin, Capitol&#39;s infamous wild card. Looks goofy but is anything but soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan sat silently, his long, clean fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft &#34;tap-tap-tap&#34; sliced through the heavy air like a blade, each note a hammer to the kneeling men&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,the finger stopped. He slowly lifted his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold voice cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how do you want to die?&#34;</p>
