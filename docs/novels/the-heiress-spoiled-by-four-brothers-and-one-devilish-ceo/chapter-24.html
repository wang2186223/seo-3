                <p>The basement was massive, enclosed on three sides by concrete walls. A harsh overhead light beamed straight down on the five men crouched below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Tristan&#39;s icy voice cut through the silence, the five guys visibly cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy stammered, lips trembling, &#34;P-please, Mr. Reid... I just got a call, said there was a girl, totally free. Told me to wait outside Prestige. Then a van with fake plates pulled up and just tossed the girl-uh, the little girl-right in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin arched his brow, chin lifted slightly.&#34;Check his phone. Find the number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bodyguard quickly frisked him, pulled out the phone, and started scrolling. He stopped at a contact and held it up for confirmation. The bald guy nodded furiously. &#34;Y-yeah, that&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin dialed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A robotic voice came through, &#34;Sorry, the numnber you dialed is no longer in service...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slightly to glance at Tristan. &#34;Disconnected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy crumpled, his whole body folding down like jelly. &#34;It was a setup... we&#39;re screwed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin lit a cigarette, took one calm drag. &#34;You recognize the driver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears instantly gushed down the guy&#39;s face. &#34;N-no... I was too busy staring at the chick... I mean, the little girl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s face darkened. He remembered that tiny girl sitting on the sofa earlier. What kind of sicko could do that to someone so small?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sneered coldly. &#34;You knew she was just a little girl, and you still did it? On our turf, too. You&#39;re really tired of living,huh?&#34;He stood up abruptly and walked straight over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand me something,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bodyguard placed tweezers in his open palm. Two others yanked the guy&#39;s arm out, gagged him tight with a cloth strip, and exposed his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;slips curled into a cruel smile, and he brought the tweezers towards the guy&#39;s fingernail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmphmmph!&#34; the man screamed in muffled agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the nails came off, no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others watched in horror, shaking in their boots, but there was nowhere to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cries echoed through the entire basement as bright red blood soaked into the stone floor beneath five mangled hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stood up, posture casual, and strolled over with his hands in his pockets. &#34;Which one of you tore my wife&#39;s dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy violently shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other four immediately turned and pointed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baldy wanted to scream. He was innocent! That woman tore it herself so she could beat them senseless!How was that his fault?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes wide with panic, he whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stared at him like he was lower than dirt. &#34;Let him talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gag came off. &#34;She tore it herself!&#34; the bald guy sobbed. &#34;Wrapped the fabric around her hands and used it to beat us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin blinked, suddenly getting it. So the skirtwas in the way-Megan ripped it for convenience. Damn,she really was something. Took down five full-grown men like it was nothing. Tristan only snorted. &#34;My wife&#39;s shy and soft-hearted. How could she possibly lay a finger on you? You terrified her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin:[These guys self-destructed,huh?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All five:[That lady was a demon in heels. Are you blind??]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s jaw flexed tight; rage flickered in his eyes. He stretched out a hand. A white glove was placed in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slowly pulled it on, every move calm yet deadly, gaze fixed on the now-silent bald guy. His gummy grin returned, the kind that made your skin crawl. &#34;Starting with you. NNo one walks away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy&#39;s eyes blew wide as Tristan raised a bronze mallet-then slammed it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each crushing blow landed on kneecaps until right legs all looked mangled beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tossed the bloody hammer aside like trash.His voice was icy. &#34;They saw what they shouldn&#39;t have.Don&#39;t deserve to keep their eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peeled off a pristine white glove and smacked it onto Kevin&#39;s chest. &#34;Next time, don&#39;t forget your gloves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin threw the glove to the floor, visibly disgusted. He stared at the blood on his hands, his lips pursing slightly. Tristan&#39;s words echoed in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly did they see?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it hit him-Megan&#39;s bright, bare legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke out on his back. If he weren&#39;t Tristan&#39;s friend, would he have gotten his eyeballs dug out too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the shivers, he started to leave-only to circle back. He was seriously curious how that woman, Megan, took down all five guys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking to one of the bodyguards, he said, &#34;Take the cloth out of those two guys&#39; mouths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard did as told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin narrowed his eyes at the two. &#34;What move took you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Instant Egg Explosion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sad Songs for the Eggs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin froze, his face a perfect mix of speechless and mildly horrifed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn. She didn&#39;t hold back at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the seventh floor, in the private guest suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max had just finished checking over Chloe. He looked calmly at Megan. &#34;She was drugged, but the dose was minor. She&#39;ll be fine after a good rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max picked up his medical kit to leave, just as Tristan came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Max pushed up the black-rimmed glasses on his nose and replied, &#34;Just a sedative. Nothing serious. And hey,heard from Kai-you two have registered your marriage.? Congrats, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Tristan a knowing smile, patted his shoulder, then walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan knew why he was smiling like that. To his buddies, Megan was queen of drama. A drama queen suddenly settling down and happily tying the knot? Gotta be some kind of new scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tristan didn&#39;t care. Megan could throw fits, act up-he&#39;d let her. Because honestly, isn&#39;t real love about her being a handful, and him just smiling through it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan saw Tristan coming, she flew into his arms, wrapping her arms tight around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, where did you go? | was so scared,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel: [Girl, were you not kicking ass five minutes ago?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai:[Someone turned on their nonsense mode.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin:[Is this the same chick who just wrecked five full-sized dudes?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked up at Tristan. &#34;Tonight, I&#39;ll stay-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even finish. Tristan&#39;s brows pulled tight, and he leaned in to whisper,&#34;Tonight,you will only stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel popped up like clockwork, &#34;I&#39;ll stay and watch Chloe. You two just head back to Dreamscape Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s dark eyes softened, a smile flickering at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was velvet-deep. &#34;The villa in Emerald Cove is all prepped. Tomorrow, you and Chloe can move in.Classes startin the morning-we&#39;ll pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of discussion.He wrapped his arm around Megan and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai went back to his stoic, cold-guy aura. &#34;I&#39;m right next door. Shout if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Tristan glanced at Kevin-and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin was crouched beside the bed, staring at Chloe like a hungry dog eyeing a juicy steak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kevin!&#34; Kai snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin turned, clearly annoyed.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai smirked. &#34;Dude. You&#39;re drooling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin wiped his mouth quickly.&#34;NO,I&#39;m not-hell no! You&#39;re messing with me!&#34; He lunged at Kai, ready to fight back. But with a loud &#34;thud,&#34; the drooling culprit face-planted on the floor.Total wipeout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel casually retracted her foot and shot him a look. &#34;Dare to mess with my man.&#34;</p>
