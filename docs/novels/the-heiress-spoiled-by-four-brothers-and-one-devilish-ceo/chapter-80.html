                <p>Reid Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Megan and Tristan were coming back, Elliot,Diane Hartwell, and Chloe had already been waiting at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on a sec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rubbed her eyes, &#34;Wait, what the heck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right next to Chloe was a familiar face flashing a big ol&#39; grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled, &#34;Looks like this guy&#39;s dead set on becoming your brother-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they got out of the car, the little twin-tailed ball of energy launched herself at Megan with a bear hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Missed you so much, sis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan poked her gently on the forehead. &#34;What&#39;s this Goofball Bro doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe beamed, &#34;Goofball Bro&#39;s been awesome. He&#39;s my personal driver now-and he always takes me out for tasty food!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin brushed a hand through his bangs,&#34;We&#39;re Team Thunder-Cutie.&#34; Megan gave him a cold sideways glance, then linked arms with Diane and Elliot as she walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe followed them in bouncing with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin scratched his head. &#34;I get the feeling my future sister-in-law doesn&#39;t like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan glanced at him and calmly adjusted his cufflinks. &#34;Be more confident. Drop the &#39;feeling&#39; part.&#34;&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot him a look. &#34;You&#39;re not reliable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin touched his face in mock horror. &#34;Is being good -looking a crime now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without reacting, Tristan asked, &#34;Found that mole in the company yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin coughed, &#34;Uh. not... not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave him a dry half-smile and headed into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin muttered,&#34;What kinda expression was that? Tch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was all made by Diane, every dish perfectly tailored to Megan&#39;s taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane kept piling food onto Megan&#39;s plate. &#34;Eat more,sweetie. Healthy babies need good nutrition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blushed instantly. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m still young. No rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cleared his throat, &#34;Let&#39;s wait till Megan finishes college.&#34; Diane smiled kindly, &#34;Just three more years, but by then, Tristan&#39;ll be twenty-nine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s eyes lit up with mischief. &#34;Guess if I become a dad, it&#39;ll be after thirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe started counting on her fingers. &#34;Why do you have to wait another four years, Goofball Bro?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin smiled sheepishly, &#34;I gotta wait for my girl to finish college too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin suddenly felt like someone stabbed him in the heart. wasn&#39;t it obvious? It&#39;s you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After chasing her all this time, was his devotion just for show?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan eyed a dish of figs near her and slid it over to Kevin. &#34;Long road ahead, my friend. Gotta stay strong -or end up forgotten and friendd-zoned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last bit really hit him right in the feels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe giggled, dimples popping. &#34;Sis, I saw the news today. Can&#39;t believe Jason saved you! He&#39;s super dreamy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin immediately leaned in, &#34;What about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave him a side-eye, &#34;You? You&#39;re definitely not as handsome as him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin:&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane, catching on to how hard Kevin was trying,gently chimed in, &#34;Chloe, watch what you say/. Sure, Kevin&#39;s not a movie star, but he&#39;s not too shabby either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin: &#34;.Ouch, Mrs. Hartwell, that still stings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot laughed, &#34;Kevin looks fine, though he&#39;s abit old for my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin: &#34;...Wow. Mr. Shaw, that&#39;s even worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, watching his totally defeated expression,couldn&#39;t help but feel kind of amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she decided to throw him a bone and changed the subject. &#34;Brandon&#39;s back from abroad next Monday.Tristan already contacted him-he&#39;ll check on Grandpa at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot gave a slight nod. &#34;Brandon from the Lewis family is known for being a tough nut to crack. Not just anyone can get him to help. This time, it&#39;s all thanks to you, Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan returned the nod. &#34;No big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot turned to Megan . &#34;Back then, you were still young and didn&#39;t see it, but now you get why your grandpa and I picked Tristan for you, right? It was the best decision ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stuck out her tongue. &#34;Yeah, yeah, I get it now.Thanks for seeing the good in him. Guess I was the only clueless one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe chimed in, &#34;Well, even Dad had his blind spots -like with Molly. Took years for him to realize how fake she was.&#34; Elliot let out a heavy sigh. &#34;You&#39;re right. That&#39;s on me.But there&#39;s still no news from Molly or Wyatt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows furrowed slightly, then he said, &#34;Not yet. But I&#39;ve already sent people to dig into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane Hartwell&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;Both of them are bad news. I just hope they&#39;re found soon before they cause more trouble for Megan again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded softly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mom. I&#39;ll keep Megan safe,no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon hung bright in the sky, shadows of trees swaying gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan drove Megan back to Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they got out of the car,Megan insisted on checking out the sunken area near the lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was dead quiet, save for the sound of crickets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand in hand, Tristan led Megan down the steps.With each step, LED strips lit up, glowing in different colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they reached the last step and looked back, it felt like they were wrapped in a rainbow,standing in a dreamlike, colorful space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced around the underground room,a bit puzzled. She couldn&#39;t figure out what he meant this place for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around Tristan&#39;s waist and looked up into his gleaming eyes. &#34;Babe, what is this place even for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan lowered his head and kissed her smooth forehead.&#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he was clearly keeping something from her, Megan just knew-whatever it was, it&#39;d blow her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s kinda chilly here. Let&#39;s go back inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Megan could react, Tristan scooped her into his arms and carried her up the stairs toward the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying against his chest, Megan grinned like sunshine.&#34;You know where you&#39;re the warmest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my arms,&#34; Tristan replied without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan twined her arms around his neck, her soft lips brushing his rough stubble. Her fingertips slipped through a gap in his shirt and rested gently on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; she giggled. &#34;It&#39;s your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s steps froze, his body tense. His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Megan burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned down and pressed a kiss to her giggling lips, voice husky. &#34;You cheeky thing... You&#39;ve gotten way more daring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan kicked her legs playfully, her delicate face the picture of innocence. &#34;But I&#39;m just a baby. What bad thoughts could I possibly have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan narrowed his eyes, lips twisting into a faint smirk. &#34;Then let&#39;s get back under the covers and see just how innocent this baby is.&#34; Upstairs, in a room on the second floor, Mr. Reid stood by the window holding his cane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the scene below,he stroked his white beard and muttered to Zeta Prime beside him, &#34;You see that?My great-grandchild is on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta&#39;s mechanical eyes rolled, then rolled back again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Nova Tech resting on his head,the little Al puppy let out a squeaky voice, &#34;It&#39;s night time, ya know. You should save that dream for the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid paused, realizing this dumb dog just threw shade at him for daydreaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thumped the floor with his dragon-headed cane,and Zeta took off running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It muttered under its breath while fleeing, &#34;Man,humans sure get cranky as they age!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, at the docks, a woman in a black dress and mask stood still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salty ocean breeze blew across her face,whispering the promise of freedom.</p>
