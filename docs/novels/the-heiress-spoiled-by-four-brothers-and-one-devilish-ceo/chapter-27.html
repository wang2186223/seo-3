                <p>Here&#39;s what went down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe was a senior at Honorbridge High, buried in the chaos of prep year. Last night, she had evening self-study at school, so the family&#39;s driver gave her a lft. She showed up ten minutes late, and by that time, the front gate was pretty much deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after the car drove off and she started heading toward the gate, her phone rang. It was tucked in her backpack, so she stopped to fish it out. But when she answered, the caller didn&#39;t say a word and just hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could make sense of it, a van screeched to a stop beside her. The door flew open and someone grabbed her without warning. Within seconds, she was smothered with a cloth over her mouth and nose-after that, everything went black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan broke it down: &#34;So the kidnapper clearly knew your routine. They knew you usually keep your phone in your backpack. Calling you served two purposes-stalling you and confirming your identity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe wiped her tears, fuming. &#34;It wvas Molly for sure! That psycho wouldn&#39;t blink at doing something like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan handed her a pack of tissues. &#34;Yeah, she&#39;s suspicious. But we&#39;ve got to dig up some proof first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan&#39;s phone buzzed. He answered, and Cameron&#39;s voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, I tried reaching you last night, but your phone was off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s tone went ice cold.&#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone wiped all traffic cam footage from the past three months. They&#39;re unrecoverable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan laughed-cold and sharp. &#34;What are the engineers in tech even doing? If they can&#39;t fix this,maybe they all need to be replaced.&#34; He hung up abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had caught the key points of the call. She wanted to tell him she already had the videos saved, but it wasn&#39;t time yet. She couldn&#39;t risk him knowing her real identity-especially since she&#39;d once hacked international corporations... including his. That time, she swiped two hundred million from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She patted Tristan&#39;s arm lightly. &#34;You alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a soft chuckle. &#34;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just a small bump. I&#39;Il handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel propped herchin in her hand. &#34;Isn&#39;t Kevin&#39;s family in the comms tech business? You&#39;d think he&#39;d be good at hacking stuff too. Maybe he can lend a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe looked interested. &#34;Wait, Kevin? The infamous spoiled rich kid from Capitol City?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow, curious too-this guy was the CEO of the leading communications tech firm in the country, backing national satellite programs. What was he really capable of?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a short laugh. &#34;He&#39;s only good at one thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three women said in unison, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being a goofball.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe cracked up. &#34;Oh my god, he&#39;s seriously the human form of a meme.What a character!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel smirked. &#34;Come to think of it, lasț night I spotted that goofball sitting on the edge of the bed staring at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s laugh cut off instantly. &#34;No way! That explains the nightmares-I dreamt some wide-eyed husky was staring at me all night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced over at Tristan. &#34;Honey, you think that husky&#39;s crushing on my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a dry cough. &#34;Listen, Kevin&#39;s a bit of a loose cannon, but emotionally? He&#39;s a blank slate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As best friend, he figured it was his duty to help his buddy out a little.But Chloe wasn&#39;t having it. She flipped her twin ponytails with a dramatic sigh.&#34;Ugh, no thanks. You don&#39;t have to cover for him, Tristan. He&#39;s already stamped as &#39;goofball&#39; and &#39;spoiled rich kid&#39; in my book. No way I&#39;d ever date someone that goofy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan:[Sorry,man.Itried.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin:[ You&#39;re the one who labeled me a &#39;goofball&#39; first!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, our dear Mr. Goofball was lounging in the front passenger seat, rushing Kai, who was behind the wheel. &#34;Come on, step on it! I need to see my girl off at school!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai glanced at him sideways, unimpressed. &#34;Did she even agree to be your girlfriend? Pretty sure that&#39;s just you living in your own fantasy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin flipped his fringe with flair. &#34;C&#39;mon, when I show up, girls practically faint at my feet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai&#39;s lips twitched. &#34;Kev, can you just... have some self-respect? You&#39;re twenty-six. That girl&#39;s eighteen.You&#39;re literally creeping into &#39;older guy&#39; territory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin shrugged. &#34;So what? You and Tristan got six years on your girls too. I&#39;m just two years ahead of the curve. Haven&#39;t you heard the saying? &#39;Older guys and cute girls? Classic combo. Totally legit!&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai:[Shameless much?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honorbridge High and Meridian University were separated by just one street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black Bentley rolled to a stop on the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel and Chloe hopped out of the carfirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently kissed Megan&#39;s hand. &#34;I&#39;ll come pick you up for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing how packed Tristan&#39;s schedule was, Megan said, &#34;It&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll eat with Rachel and Chloe. Just come grab me after class around 4:30.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a small nod. &#34;If anything happens,call me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bentley didn&#39;t drive off right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan knew Tristan wouldn&#39;t leave until he saw her walk into school safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Chloe. &#34;Go on, have a good class. I&#39;ll wait for you at lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe nodded. &#34;Okay, I&#39;m heading in. See you later, Meg, Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she swung her bag onto her shoulder and started to cross the road, a flamboyant figure popped up out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo!Chloe-baby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe was not having it. Her face changed as she bolted back toward Megan, yelling,&#34;Sis! Creep alert!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin froze mid-step. &#34;Wait, how did I end up being the creep?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai gave her a thumbs-up. &#34;Good instincts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking up to Megan and Rachel, Kevin glanced at the girl hiding behind her sister. &#34;Hey uh, I&#39;m Kevin Ward.Totally harmless. Definitely not a stalker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe peeked out, eyeing him. &#34;You&#39;re... that goofball guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hluh?&#34; Kevin looked completely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin glanced at the Bentley and frowned. Yeah, Tristan probably didn&#39;t paint himm in the best light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan motioned Chloe closer. &#34;It&#39;s fine, just call him Goofball Bro.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave a tiny nod. &#34;Hi, Goofball Bro.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin twitched at the nickname, but hey-at least she called him Bro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed his fringe with exaggerated elegance. &#34;Come on, your Goofball Bro will escort you to class.&#34; Kevin looked at Megan and said, &#34;Relax, Meg-your sis is basically my sis. I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s super safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took Chloe&#39;s bag and slung it over his own shoulder.&#34;Let&#39;s go. Don&#39;t wanna be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave a small nod and followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel sent a passionate look Kai&#39;s way. &#34;Guess I&#39;m off with Meg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai didn&#39;t flinch. Just let out a non-committal &#34;Mm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Megan and Rachel turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the two figures disappeared into the school gates, the black Bentley merged back into traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai only got back into the car after confirming they were out of sight.</p>
