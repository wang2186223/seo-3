                <p>Megan turned her head and caught the male nurse staring at her in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Shaw, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave him a calm smile, lifting the feather duster in her hand. &#34;Just dusting off a bit, no biggie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, she gave herself a mental high five-classic misdirection, worked like a charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hopped off the chair lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the sound of heels clicked outside the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open and in walked Molly, holding a soft pink bouquet in one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw Megan, she flashed a sugary smile. &#34;Oh! So you&#39;re here too,Meg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice might sound sweet to others, butto Megan,it was pure nails-on-chalkboard. Her eyes narrowed.&#34;He&#39;s not even your real grandpa, and his wife&#39;s not your real grandma. You seriously think you need to come here pretending to care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly set the fruit basket on the table and pouted,playing the hurt victim. &#34;We&#39;ve lived under the same roof for over ten years. Grandpa really means so much to me. You still can&#39;t forgive me, Meg? I never meant for things to turn out this way. I really am sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male nurse&#39;s jaw nearly hit the floor. Was this the same woman who last time acted all high and mighty?She was terrifying! Two-faced to the core. All this rich family drama. nope, better stay out of it before he got caught in the crossfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan couldn&#39;t be bothered with Molly anymore. She washed her hands in the bathroom, then sat by the bed and started peeling an apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly,seeing she was being ignored, forced a smile and said, &#34;Grandpa Reid&#39;s birthday banquet is this Saturday. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be attending too,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced up at her in silence for a second.&#34;Oh?So you&#39;re going too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly lowered her gaze, giving another soft smile. &#34;I&#39;m going as Wyatt&#39;s date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha.&#34; Megan sliced off a piece of apple and popped it into her mouth. &#34;His date or... his bedtime buddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you even saying, Meg?&#34; Molly gripped her purse tightly, clearly stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m speaking plain English,&#34; Megan deadpanned.&#34;If you don&#39;t get it, then step out and close the door on your way. I don&#39;t want you fake-crying over my grandpa ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face turned pale, then flushed red. Her lips pressed into a thin line, nails digging into her leather bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she forced herself to speak gently. &#34;Alright, then.I&#39;ll leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she turned, she even swiped at her cheek like wiping away invisible tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut, Megan stood up and turned to the nurse. &#34;If she shows up again, or anyone else unfamiliar comes around, I want to be informed immediately. What&#39;s your number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rattledit off, and Megan dialed right then and there.&#34;Here&#39;s mine. Call me first thing if anything&#39;s off.&#34;The nurse gave a nod. &#34;Got it. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grabbed her bag and headed out of the hospital. On the way, her phone buzzed-Molly was in the middle of a call. Without hesitation, Megan tapped into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices of Molly and Wyatt came through loud and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly said, &#34;I tried to plant the camera at the hospital for evidence, but ran into that bitch unexpectedly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt replied, &#34;So it didn&#39;t work? Whatever. Just finish her off Saturday night. Then pull the hallway footage -it&#39;ll look like Tristan was the one with her. That idiot will totally fall for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly scoffed, &#34;I haven&#39;t told you yet, but ever since she went on that hunger strike, she&#39;s totally changed.I can&#39;t control her like before.&#34;  Wyatt&#39;s tone turned cold. &#34;Then we&#39;ll make Saturday count. Stir things up between her and Tristan-make sure she hates him. He&#39;ll let her do anything she wants anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Molly said, determined. &#34;This time, it&#39;ll work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also got word that the fighter got caught.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill. You never contacted him directly, right? Plus the guy handling the girl and the hacker-different numbers, voice changers, the works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did all that, yeah. Still... makes me nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No loose ends, remember? Just tell him to kill the girl and bury her. Then vanish from the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Oh, and I&#39;ve found this drug-any woman takes it and loses all control. Even someone pure and stubborn won&#39;t be able to resist. That adopted brat dared to insult me? She&#39;s dead meat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt chuckled. &#34;As long as you&#39;re having fun. Baby,come over already. I&#39;ve never tried it in a hospital room Can&#39;t wait for you to jump me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awful!&#34; Molly giggled. &#34;I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to them, Megan&#39;s eyes darkened with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t even spare a little girl. And now,they planned to drug Rachel too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monsters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, those two banked on Tristan&#39;s love for her-manipulating her to hurt him, using her to steal company secrets. What they didn&#39;t expect was that she was the hacker who dealt the final blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Tristan found out it was her, he didn&#39;t fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had pushed back just a little, maybe the company wouldn&#39;t have collapsed so thoroughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Megan&#39;s gaze ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two? Dream on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut off the tapped call, started the engine, and headed straight to Reid Corporation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Samuel stepped out of the Knight Café and into his sports car.He twirled the flash drive between his fingers, a faint smirk tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Megan used Four-Eyes as a cover? Not like the guy sold her out-dude clearly has no clue about programming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her connection with Blackwing definitely isn&#39;t simple</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as he sticks with her, he&#39;ll eventually trace Blackwing&#39;s trail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reid Group Headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach drifted into the parking spot with smooth precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, carrying a backpack, strode toward the  towering skyscraper, heading straight for the executive elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when a receptionist in uniform walked up with a polished smile. &#34;Hello, miss. Who are you here to see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan curved her lips into a polite smile. &#34;I&#39;m here for Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist dipped her head slightly. &#34;Do you have an appointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan held up her phone. &#34;Yeah, I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining professional, the receptionist nodded.&#34;Please come to the front desk to register. I&#39;ll get in touch with Assistant Brooks. If you&#39;re on the list, we&#39;ll take you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small nod, cooperating nicely. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was signing in, another receptionist sashayed over-this one wearing heavy makeup and carrying a steaming cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes scanned Megan with a full dose of arrogance.&#34;Ugh, another gold-digger here for the boss? Girl,have you looked in a mirror? Think you can just climb into his bed looking like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan laughed lightly. &#34;It&#39;s fine to protect your boss,but trash talk doesn&#39;t seem very &#39;professional&#39;. Is this how employees at Reid Group treat guests?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first receptionist looked embarrassed. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,miss.&#34;  With a loud clunk, the flashy receptionist slammed the coffee cup on the desk, some of the hot liquid splashing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped, &#34;Why the hell are you apologizing to some random chick trying to sleep her way up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first receptionist frowned,about to call Assistant Brooks, but the other woman reached over and ended the call mid-ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing her arms dramatically, she sneered at Megan &#34;Girls like you show up all the time. Save it and get lost. What if the boss actually notices you? Then what -do I just disappear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at her, who was holding her head high like a queen bee, and calmly dialed Tristan&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could hit call, the woman grabbed her wrist. &#34;Look at this! She&#39;s actually pretending she knows the CEO. Got some nerve, thinking he&#39;d go for someone like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s patience hit its limit. She yanked her arm back with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;You just hit me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hissed and immediately grabbed the coffee cup,flinging it straight toward Megan.</p>
