                <p>The unexpected visitor turned out to be Paul, the head of the anti-vice squad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall and broad-shouldered, the guy carried himself with a presence that was hard to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the seat next to Ryan and chuckled, &#34;Now this is a surprise, a rare guest indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan threw him a frosty look. &#34;Cut the crap. Say what you came to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul could tell Tristan was ticked off. He cleared his throat before speaking, &#34;Got a report last night-two solicitation cases at the Empire Hotel. One of the people involved, Natalie&#39;s mom, Nancy, is now accusing your wife of being the mastermind, saying she paid people to ruin her daughter&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan calmly pulled out her phone and started a livestream, playing the full conversation between Molly and Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You recorded this?&#34; Paul asked, eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Megan rolled her eyes. Of course, she recorded it. But hell would freeze over before she admitted that. Who knew if they&#39;d turn the whole thing around and claim she was being vindictive? Better play it safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a straight face, Megan said, &#34;Wasn&#39;t me. If I&#39;d heard anything like that, I would&#39;ve shut it down before it got anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a law-abiding citizen, I would&#39;ve messaged Captain Evans right away. I only got this recording this morning If you want, I can send it via Bluetooth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Paul reached for his phone to accept it, a flood of notifications lit up his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Natalie Banks and Molly Shaw&#39;s scheme backfires]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Heiress fails to ruin rival, mom tries to cover it up]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Faux-sweet Molly plotted to destroy her own sister]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, headlines just like that poppedup online. Videos, audio, everything-already out in the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the whole internet knew the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul gave a sheepish laugh, &#34;Looks like that won&#39;t be necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face kept its hard edge. &#34;I&#39;ll have my lawyer,Linus Blake, take it from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he and Megan left the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Ryan was already leading ten officers to the Reid family estate to arrest Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sleek black Maybach pulled up to the old mansion, three patrol cars followed right behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out on the lawn, Sophia, who was walking with Wyatt,frowned. &#34;What&#39;s going on now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s dark eyes narrowed in suspicion as he spotted Tristan and Megan approaching. A knot of unease tightened in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the meaning of this?&#34; he asked sharply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a cold smirk. &#34;You don&#39;t do shady stuff,you&#39;ve got nothing to fear from ghosts, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan whispered under his breath,&#34;...Great, guess that makes us the ghosts now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tugged at Tristan&#39;s arm and tiptoed to whisper,&#34;Babe, I forgot to mention-this estate was under a signal block. They don&#39;t know what happened outside.I&#39;ll turn it back on now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tapped her nose with the barest smile. &#34;Smart move. Otherwise,someone might&#39;ve made a run for it by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pulled out her phone and tapped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two chatted openly, Sophia&#39;s face tightened.&#34;What are you two getting at? Is all this for our benefit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan ran a hand along the bracelet on her wrist and said calmly, &#34;Wyatt messed up-big time. According to family rules, what should the punishment be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice was cold and clear. &#34;Remove his name from the will. From now on, he doesn&#39;t exist to us.&#34; Sophia barked out, &#34;Remove his name from the will?What on earth did he do that you&#39;d go this far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Ryanstepped forward, holding a warrant in his hand. &#34;Wyatt, you&#39;re suspected of orchestrating a murder. You have the rightto remain silent, but anything you say can and will be used in court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s eyes darkened slightly. He ran his tongue over his molars and said coldly, &#34;I want my lawyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quipped with a smirk, &#34;Even if you hire a god, it won&#39;t save you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Sophia shot back, stepping in front of his wheelchair. &#34;I won&#39;t let you take my son away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,Mr.Reid, Bruce, and Nathan walked out from the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia rushed toward Nathan, clinging to his arm and bursting into tears. &#34;They&#39;re framing our son for murder! Honey, don&#39;t let them take himn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan pulled his arm free and shoved his phone in front of her face. &#34;Then take a look at what your dear son&#39;s been up to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Messages had just started pouring in now that the phone got signal-one after another about the prostitution bust at the Empire Hotel and today&#39;s bombshell audio exposing the conspiracy between the Shaw girl and Wyatt against Bernard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stared at the screen in shock, eyes wide in disbelief. &#34;No... this has to be fake. They&#39;re trying to frame my Wyatt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s voice turned ice-cold. &#34;You really think everyone around you is blind? You think that kind of fake stuff could get past the cops?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid slammed his cane hard on the ground.&#34;What a disgrace! Spends all day plotting harm! Let him rot in prison and reflect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Wyatt stood up from the wheelchair and walked straight toward Tristan and Megan. &#34;So what if you erase me from the family registry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan clicked her tongue. &#34;Cheated on yesterday,exiled today... karma really hits back fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s eyes locked onto her, dark and venomous, like he could kill her with a look. &#34;You were the one replacing my meds at the hospital, weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! Bet you didn&#39;t see that coming, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt clenched his jaw hard. &#34;We&#39;re far from done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed past the two and headed straight for the police car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sirens wailed, echoing through the old Reid house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Sophia, the noise was like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to Megan, it was music-the sweetest sound in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Molly and Wyatt thrown behind bars was all she ever wanted. But that night, Megan&#39;s relief was cut short by a gut-punching twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way to the detention center, the police convoy was ambushed. Every officer was killed. Both suspects vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she got Cameron&#39;s message,Megan pulled up surveillance footage from the attack route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a black minivan with fake plates speed up past the police car, then swing in front of it. Armed men inside opened fire on the officers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The squad car had bulletproof windows, but not rocket-proof-it didn&#39;t stand a chance against a DZJ08launcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blast sent the car flying. Five masked mercenaries -fully geared-jumped out of the van, yanked Wyatt and Molly from the wreck, and tossed them into the van like luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers who weren&#39;t dead from the first attack got gunned down one by one. The ones who were already dead got shot again for good measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was surgical, brutal, and absolutely professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black van then sped onto the highway, swerving off at an unmonitored exit onto a rural road-and vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan saw the frown on Megan&#39;s face as she stared intently at the footage. He reached over and gently ruffled her hair. &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. Cops will handle it.&#34; Megan gave a small nod. &#34;Yea. but I can&#39;t shake the feeling that this wasn&#39;t just a simple jailbreak. What if there&#39;s more behind it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress yourself out,&#34; Tristan said as he scooped her up and carried her to the bed. &#34;Sleep on it.Whatever it is, it&#39;s not your burden to carry.&#34;</p>
