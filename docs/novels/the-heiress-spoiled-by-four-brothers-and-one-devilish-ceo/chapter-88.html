                <p>Two men in sharp suits stepped onto the crimson carpet-one in charcoal grey, the other in deep sapphire blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel shot a sideways glance at Jason and said,&#34;Bro, did you really have to go all formal tonight? I look totally outclassed next to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason&#39;s eyes had a calm clarity, with a gentle hue beneath the cool surface. His well-defined features carried a trace of quiet melancholy, like a piece of art displayed behind glass-beautiful, untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a faint smile. &#34;Even if I threw on a potato sack,I&#39;d still outshine you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked speechless. &#34;Wow, ruthless. I used to be the school&#39;s poster boy, y&#39;know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason let out a soft, amused snort. &#34;And I&#39;m a  national heartthrob.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel curled his lips. &#34;Well, Tristan is an international heartthrob.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of that name wiped the smile off Jason&#39;s face. &#34;Seriously? That&#39;s just throwing shade at your own family. ldiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel:&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters lined up along both sides, eagerly raising their mics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lewis, who are you rooting for to win tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, are you here to support Megan -Mrs. Reid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since Miss Lewis is a contestant too, are you cheering for your sister tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before either of them could answer, a petite figure hurried over. Trailing behind her was a chubby girl carrying a case, along with three top domestic models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,Samuel!&#34; Amelia wore a pure white off-shoulder lace gown.Her collarbones peeked through subtly, and her elegance gave off a snow-lotus-on-ice vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her sweet voice and tiny footsteps, she quickly slipped between her brothers and playfully hooked her arms around theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the two men clearly looked annoyed,they didn&#39;t shake her off-probably for the sake of appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so you&#39;re here to support your little sister&#39;s big moment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Word has it that the winner might get to co-star with Mr.Lewis in his new project!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Miss Lewis wins tonight, we could see a sibling duo on screen-how exciting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, any thoughts seeing Mr. and Mrs. Reid together tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel, we heard you once stepped in during a campus attack involving Mrs. Reid-are all the Lewis  brothers that protective of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia had planned to ride her brother&#39;s fame into the spotlight. But the media just kept circling back to Megan,never giving her the center stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be the highlight tonight, the showstopper, the queen of the night. She wasn&#39;t going to let anyone steal her thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm sparkle in her eyes and a composed smile, she said, &#34;My brothers are kind-hearted.They&#39;ve already clarified their actions that day-for them, it didn&#39;t matter who needed help, they&#39;d step in regardless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hope our friends in the media don&#39;t twist their actions or chase clout at the cost of my brothers&#39;peace of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for who wins tonight, well, maythe best woman win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like you&#39;re feeling pretty confident, Miss  Lewis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia beamed. &#34;With my brothers here to support me, how could I not give it my all? Let&#39;s all wait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arm in arm with Jason and Samuel, she strutted down the red carpet, graceful and poised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the venue, she tactfully let go of their arms, clearly sensing they weren&#39;t keen on maintaining the act any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting her hands together in front of her, she gave a bright smile. &#34;Jason, Samuel, I&#39;ll head to my dressing room now to get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby girl sneaked a peek at Jason, her cheeks turning crimson, before scurrying after Amelia.The three models glanced back at the Lewis brothers with a hint of reluctance before following Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Amelia&#39;s retreating figure, Samuel asked,&#34;Jason, who do you think will win tonight?&#34;  Jason gave it some thought, then looked at him,&#34;Who do you want to win? I&#39;ll go with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel rubbed his chin. &#34;Then I hope Amelia takes the crown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason raised an eyebrow, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. &#34;You and that royal blue suit of yours do make a good match with her getup tonight. Please, stay a bit further from me-we&#39;re clearly not on the same wavelength.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and headed toward the exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The convention center held a massive runway with the judges&#39; panel up front. Rows of seats flanked both sides, neatly lined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front seats on either side were for VIP guests.The further back, the cheaper the ticket-just supply and demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, tonight&#39;s competition, while not on the scale of an international event, was still a major show in Verduria. Scalpers were pushing regular seats to 200k, and tickets were practically impossible to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason and Samuel stepped into the hall, scanning for their spots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the seat numbers, they soon noticed a tall,commanding figure had already taken his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked up with a pleasant expression. &#34;Mr.Lewis, Samuel. Small world,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason and Samuel gave a polite nod before sitting down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason glanced sideways at Tristan, seated right beside him. &#34;I just want to make one thing clear-l&#39;ve got zero intentions toward your wife. Don&#39;t let the rumors mess with your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel chimed in, &#34;Yeah, we just. felt kind of a connection with her. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a hint of amusement in Tristan&#39;s eyes.&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Even if there were, you wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;  Just then, Cameron approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached out, catching an envelope which he handed to Jason. &#34;A little something to thank you for saving my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason opened it. Inside was a stack of photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled one out, his brows instantly furrowed. &#34;You were trailing her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned back, totally unfazed. &#34;I only track two kinds of people-my wife, and anyone looking to hurt her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason&#39;s mind immediately jumped-Tristan must&#39;ve found out they tested Megan&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel grabbed the photos and skimmed through them quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in the pictures was unmistakably Amelia.The date matched the day Mlegan was hit with eggs,and the location was the Capital Hospital. In one photo,Amelia was wearing a nurse uniform, holding something as she exited the lab. In another, she was  leaning against a wall, looking almost terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a soft chuckle. &#34;The Lewis family&#39;s tested all kinds of people before. Might be time for another run-you never know, maybe your beloved heiress is still in the mix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason felt sure of one thing now: Tristan didn&#39;t know they&#39;d tested Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t know, then there was no reason to give it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason looked puzzled. &#34;So you followed her. are you saying she tried to hurt Mrs.-your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his change in phrasing, Tristan&#39;s face eased slightly. &#34;Whether she did or not, let&#39;s keep watching and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason and Samuel exchanged a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel took out his phone and shot off a text:[Amelia tampered with the test results.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a message came back from Oliver: [So that&#39;s why she came to my room that day-she was after my hair.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the phone tightly, Samuel fumed in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he leaned toward Jason&#39;s ear and whispered,&#34;Later tonight, maybe you should try pulling another hair from Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot him a side-eye like he was looking at a total idiot. &#34;You&#39;ve got a death wish for both of us or just me?&#34;</p>
