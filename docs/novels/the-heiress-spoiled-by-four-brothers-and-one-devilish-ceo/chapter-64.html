                <p>Right then, the big screen on stage lit up out of nowhere, showing two side-by-side surveillance videos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What popped up? Absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left side was a two-on-one, right side a three-on-one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every person in the hall had their eyes glued to the screen-come on, who wouldn&#39;t peek at a scandal like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was free drama, and if it&#39;s there,people are gonna watch-especially when it&#39;s this intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the big shots and politicians in attendance weren&#39;t immune-they were fully hooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmur began to swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, isn&#39;t that Molly on the left? And Natalie on the right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, she looks like a total angel during the day,but this... this is next level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s giving off major &#39;pro-level&#39; vibes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think it&#39;s fake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, man! It&#39;s live! Wait, doesn&#39;t that room look just like one in the Empire Hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn... So these two thought Mr. Reid&#39;s birthday bash was the perfect excuse to hook some sugar daddies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But isn&#39;t Molly supposed to be with Wyatt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you see he&#39;s in a wheelchair now? Maybe he can&#39;t keep up in that department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yikes! So she&#39;s literally cheating in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, chick&#39;s clearly got a strong appetite. That two -on-one setup? Wild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie went even harder-three-on-one? The Lee family backed out just in time-Logan Lee&#39;s son nearly got cheated on.!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in the room were loving the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia scoffed quietly, &#34;Idiot. Can&#39;t even mess things up right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had told her about the plan earlier, but there was no way she&#39;d get involved. All she wanted was to sit back and see Megan make a fool of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the whole thing backfired-Natalie ended up center stage instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Amelia deleted &#34;Natalie Banks&#34; from her contact list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No use keeping dead weight around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking back, she walked right out of the Empire Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Mr. Reid and Bruce both looked absolutely furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid shot Wyatt a sharp glare. &#34;This is who you chose? What a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the two stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s hands were clenched so tightly that his nails cut into the armrest. Fury burned in his chest, and hatred swirled in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly-completely useless. Tried to trap someone else,and ended up falling into her own trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t just mess up-she dragged him down too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked at Sophia, who was still in shock. &#34;Mom,let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s teeth were practically grinding. &#34;That vixen humiliated my Wyatt in front of everyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed over and started pushing his wheelchair out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearl quickly covered Lina&#39;s eyes, but the girl pulled her hands away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they&#39;re bold enough to do it, I&#39;m bold enough to watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You silly kid,&#34; Pearl muttered, grabbing her hand and dragging her out with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan immediately ordered the hotel staff to shut the screen off. But no luck. Turned out the screen&#39;s power was rigged into the master system-cutting it would shut down the entire hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison rubbed his chin and smirked at Julian. &#34;Damn...Molly&#39;s really something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See how she moves? She&#39;s obviously got experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian knew exactly what that glint in Harrison&#39;s eye meant. Woman trouble, again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, &#34;I&#39;m gonna go help clear the guests. Your wife&#39;s here, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Harrison didn&#39;t even flinch. As far as he was concerned, his clueless wife couldn&#39;t touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could bring another woman home and still sleep soundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad for him-Evelyn yanked his arm and whispered sharply, &#34;You might be shameless, but I still have a reputation. We&#39;re leaving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison yanked his arm free with a sharp jerk. &#34;Outta my way-l&#39;ve got some steam to blow off. You figure the rest out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw the words over his shoulder as he stormed off toward the banquet hall doors, glancing back every couple steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the sleazy smile spreading over his face,Evelyn felt a wave of regret hit her-what kind of blind fool had she been to fall for a guy like him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in her eyes, just as a tall figure stopped beside her. A white handkerchief was handed over.The man&#39;s voice was low, husky. &#34;Here... wipe your tears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides feeling grateful, Evelyn&#39;s eyes flickered with something new-like she&#39;d just seen a glmmer of light cut through her dark, suffocating world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the hall, Richard and Nancy stared blankly at the giant screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman tangled up in a messy threesome onscreen looked an awful lot like... their daughter,Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing next to them, Logan Lee and his wife Linda Spencer wore expressions full of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linda scoffed, &#34;Wow. Never imagined your daughter was this kind of girl. And here I thought there was talk of marrying into our family! Where&#39;d you even get that kind of nerve? Good thing my son didn&#39;t show up today-what a disaster that would&#39;ve been!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s eyes narrowed with disgust. &#34;Great parenting,really. If that wedding had gone through, we&#39;d be a laughing stock right now too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, they turned to leave, Linda muttering as they went, &#34;Dodged a bullet. Imagine having in-laws like this-talk about trash luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy,in full panic, rushed toward the screen. &#34;Turn it off! Shut it down, now! It&#39;s not real-it can&#39;t be real!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard felt like his dignity had just been stomped into the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a staggering step toward the screen himself,wanting to shield it with hs not-so-imposing frame.But suddenly his vision swam, and he collapsed face-first onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy was too busy trying to block prying eyes with her arms to notice her husband had gone down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in the hall were being calmly ushered out.Some men, dragged away by their partners, still sneaked glances at the screen with lingering curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Richard lying on the floor-everyone had seen it,but no one moved. Why bother? They&#39;d rather stay far away. A scandal like this follows you forever-it&#39;s better to act like you never knew the guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan rushed in, kneeling beside Richard to check his breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still alive. Pulling out his phone, he dialed.&#34;Emergency at the JunleBanquet Hall, first floor of the Empire Hotel. We&#39;ve got a man down...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the hotel staff were working fast. Since each floor had a different room layout, they&#39;d identified the scene on the screen based on decor clues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager sent ten employees up to that floor to find the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audio from the videos gave it away-too loud and chaotic. They quickly confirmed theroom numbers: 907 and 908.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swiping a keycard, the manager swung open the door -and immediately wanted to bleach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly was in the middle of it all, utterly soaked in desire, twisting and posing like she didn&#39;t care who was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men with her panicked when the crowd burst in, shoving her aside and scrambling to cover up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly, clearly not done, launched herself at the nearest staff member, body bare, legs wrapping around him, rubbing up like she couldn&#39;t get enough</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The poor guy pulled her off with visible disgust.&#34;Get off me! You&#39;re disgusting-would sleep with anyone,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel manager snapped, &#34;Grab those two! You&#39;re messing with the Empire Hotel&#39;s name? Guess you&#39;ve got a death wish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four staff members immediately restrained both men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were set up!&#34; one of them shouted. &#34;Somebody called and said there was a free girl here-we didn&#39;t know nothin&#39;!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, man! Let&#39;s talk this out, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a group of over ten police officers came hurrying down the hallway.</p>
