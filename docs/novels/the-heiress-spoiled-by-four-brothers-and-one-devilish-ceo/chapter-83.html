                <p>Megan had no clue about Jason&#39;s little move-she just thought he was brushing some dust off her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when that fishy smell hit her nose, she wrinkled her brow in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Jason felt she was being ungrateful. He reeked because he took the hit for her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, &#34;You don&#39;t need to be *too*thankful or anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Megan let out a snort,&#34;Wouldn&#39;t be caught in today&#39;s mess if it wvasn&#39;t for *you*, thank you very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason looked at her in disbelief. Was that even human speech?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you hadn&#39;t played hero yesterday, pissing off that swarm of stalker fan, none of this would&#39;ve happened! Just like Sam the Sham&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason muttered, &#34;Sam the Sham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason! You okay?&#34; Samuel rushed over, out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason chuckled, &#34;You&#39;re the &#39;Sam the Sham&#39; she was talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel narrowed his long, fox-like eyes at Megan,&#34;Did you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason pat his shoulder, &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go hit the showers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel recoiled. &#34;Geez, Jason, you stink! Let&#39;s keep a bit of distance,yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Lewis brothers disappeared into the distance,Megan called out, &#34;Thanks, Mr. Movie Star Jason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason didn&#39;t look back, just waved a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her, Rachel was staring dreamily at his tall,straight back. &#34;Even smelling like garbage, he still looks like a king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head. &#34;Hey, Megan, you think Jason might actually be into you? Dude gifted you that 600million necklace, took a hit for you, and even shielded you from flying eggs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flicked her forehead, &#34;Girl, what are you even dreaming about? When has Jason *ever* looked at me with anything close to affection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel scratched her head. &#34;Then why is he so nice to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan narrowed her eyes slightly. &#34;He once said I reminded him of his mom. Maybe that&#39;s why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But both brothers treat you really well!&#34; Rachel suddenly recalled another guy who stepped up earlier. &#34;Say, people these days are surprisingly brave,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally,&#34; Megan agreed. But her mind replayed how that other guy had clearly tried to shield her,only for Jason to shove him aside and take the front. She couldn&#39;t help but smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s funny?&#34; Rachel asked, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gently rubbed the top of her head, &#34;Nothing.Just thinking you were lucky today.&#34; If Jason hadn&#39;t popped up, you&#39;d have been the one in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get to class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Capital Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel held up a long strand of hair between his fingers. &#34;Man, you really pulled it off, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave him a sideways glance. &#34;Hurry up and get this to the lab and match it to yours. Get Mr. Hall to do it personally-this has to be quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel nodded and bolted straight to the testing department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Hall, being close with Brandon and known for his caution and detail, had always been someone the Lewis family trusted. Normally, Brandon handled DNA checks himself, but whenever he was out of the country, Mr. Hall was the go-to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After calling him, Samuel handed over the hair with emphasis on how important this test was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Hall promised he&#39;d oversee everything and they&#39;d get a result within two hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Samuel left the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he opened the car door, he instantly brought his hand up to cover his nose. &#34;Didn&#39;t feel it earlier when we were together, but after walking back and catching a whiff again... Bro, you stink!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot him a sharp look. &#34;Did Mr. Hall look uneasy when he talked to you just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, totally. I told him this test mattered a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason let out a cold chuckle. &#34;Well, that&#39;s &#39;cause you smelled amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud thud, he slammed the door shut and the car sped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel caught a whiff of the rotten egg stench on himself and finally understood why Mr. Hall looked like he&#39;d swallowed a lemon. Smelled amazing? More like a biohazard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When people walking past him started giving him odd looks, he just wanted to crawl under a rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flagged down a cab, ready to head back to Meridian University. Since they&#39;d used Jason&#39;s car earlier, he&#39;d left his own parked at school. Time to grab his car, hit the villa for a shower, and loop back for the report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours later, feeling fresh and clean, Samuel arrived at the Capital Hospital right on time. He was buzzing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he saw the test report Mr. Hall handed over, the smile vanished from his face. The result? No genetic relation between the two samples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weird emptiness started spreading through his chest. He frowned hard, pulling out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it?&#34; asked Jason on the other end. Just two words, but Samuel could hear the tension in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled quietly.&#34;It&#39;s a no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence. Then the call dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent a text to Oliver:[No match.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing in deeply, he realized the air around him didn&#39;t feel as crisp as when he first came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a corridor by the emergency stairs,someone in scrubs slowly slid down the wall.Clutched tightly in her hand-a single long strand of hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even want to imagine what could&#39;ve happened if that hair had gone in for testing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, she quickly stood up, stripped off the nurse uniform, and left the hospital in a hrry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to head back to Lindon City and get some hair from the Lewis family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a two-hour drive from the capital to Lindon City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Amelia reached the Lewis family estate in Lindon City, it was nearly 3 p.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking through the gate like she owned the place,her face calm as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Housekeeper Mrs. Clark greeted her with a small bow. &#34;Welcome home, Miss Amelia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia gave her a graceful smile. &#34;Mrs. Clark, has anyone else come home today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, ma&#39;am. None of the young masters have returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia nodded politely. &#34;I left a piece for tomorrow&#39;s competition here. Thought I&#39;d come grab it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like me to help you look for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled gently. &#34;No need, thank you. I&#39;ll manage.Go ahead with your work.&#34; As Mrs. Clark walked away, the smile on Amelia&#39;s face faded. Inside, she was on edge-but her movements stayed elegant and unhurried as she stepped ontothe zigzagging staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third floor, she quietly doubled back to the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her almond-shaped eyes scanned the surroundings cautiously before she darted into Oliver&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all the brothers, Oliver stayed in Lindon City the most. Jason was often filming out of town, and Samuel rarely left the imperial capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly moved to the bed, lifted the velvet blanket, checking under it and the pillows for any stray strands of hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she spotted one by the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking it up with her fingers, she let a small smirk play across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just then. the door handle turned. The door pushed open.</p>
