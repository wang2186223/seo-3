                <p>Everyone stared up, completely dumbfounded. What the heck was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech, with her soft but smug little voice,announced proudly, &#34;Listen up, you clueless humans,my Goddess is Lila Moore herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping that bomb, she landed gracefully on Megan&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she sensed something icy in the air, and immediately shoved her robot dog head into the crook of Megan&#39;s neck, trembling like crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, everything made sense. The &#34;Goddess&#34;the machine dog mentioned-it was Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall went dead silent. No one could believe that the founder of their beloved fashion brand was this girl who looked barely twenty. Rachel looked totally lost. She turned to Kai, blurting,&#34;Kai, am I hearing things? Did that dumb dog say Megan is Lila Moore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai reached out and pinched her cheek. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;I&#39;m really hallucinating then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was in full-on disbelief. &#34;Bro, that girl is actually Lila Moore?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason reached over and closed his brother&#39;s gaping mouth. &#34;I heard it too. You&#39;re acting like someone who&#39;s never seen anything in life. Even a robot looks down on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason darted a glance at Tristan. He noticed a quick flicker of surprise in the man&#39;s eyes before it disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;So, I take it this is news to you too,Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a light laugh. &#34;Please, I&#39;ve known all along.&#34; Cameron, standing nearby, didn&#39;t even dare to breathe too loudly. He had a feeling that Tristan just found out like the rest of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Tristan figured out he had known before him...Cameron might really end up sent to work in the mines in Africa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan faced Amelia. &#34;Copying my design? Seriously,are you trying to bury yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s eyes filled with tears, giving off that pitiful vibe. &#34;Th-That&#39;s impossible! No one&#39;s ever seen Lila Moore.You&#39;re lying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia put her hands on her hips. &#34;Excuse me, I&#39;m not no one, okay? Dumbass! Bet you didn&#39;t expect to run into a steel wall today,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a faint smile. &#34;Out of respect for your family, I won&#39;t press charges. But from now on, the design world is off-limits to you. Permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia bit down hard on her lower lip, her heart pounding like it was about to burst out of her throat. She couldn&#39;t accept this outcome-no way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the double doors swung open, and in strode Ryan with three officers tailing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood just below the runway and said, &#34;Ms.Amelia, someone reported that you&#39;ve had close contact with fugitive Molly. We need you to come with us and assist in our investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia looked over at Jason and Samuel, hoping-what,for help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them stood up and headed toward the exit without so much as a glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That flicker of hope inside her instantly crumbled into nothing.Who was she even counting on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jason who had just exposed her lie. Why would he care what happened to her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her gaze, eyes burning with a fierce and growing hatred.She took a deep breath and followed Ryan out of the hall. Megan cast one last glance at his disappearing figure, then turned her sharp gaze to the flashy older woman who&#39;d accused her of plagiarism earlier.&#34;Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;d rip your own head off if I didn&#39;t plagiarize? Well, I&#39;m right here, waiting for your little show-go ahead and pull that pig head off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman trembled with rage, her voice shaky.&#34;You&#39;re going too far!&#34; Then, tail between her legs,she made a quick escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan flicked his wrist, and Cameron stepped forward instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dig into her background,&#34; Tristan ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The competition went on-though everyone already knew the outcome, the formalities still had to be wrapped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges came up to award Megan the championship trophy, then crowded around her,snapping photos together. Many socialites began swarming around Megan,hoping to cozy up to her. After all, they were hardcore fans of the LX brand. Getting on this designer queen&#39;s good side meant opening every door in the fashion wold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John slipped through the crowd with a hopeful grin.&#34;Lila Moore, mind if I grab a quick photo with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. A sudden coldness wrapped around him like a tight jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stiffly turned his head to look up-and froze at the sight of the tall figure before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a mouthful of overly white veneers, he chuckled awkwardly. &#34;Mr. Reid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, he vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curled into a teasing smirk, mischief flickering in his eyes. &#34;So my wife turned out to be Lila Moore,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan held his big hand in both of hers, softly  tracing his palm with her fingertp. &#34;Hehe, surprise!Bet you didn&#39;t see that coming. Lila Moore&#39;s no mister,y&#39;know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Tristan wrapped his arm around her waist, tucking her close. &#34;Not a mister, but definitely one clever little lady. That starlight gown? Cost me five million bucks. And now you&#39;re wearing it again.Total con job-nicely played.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes sparkled with laughter. &#34;Honestly, I thought that mystery buyer was just a rich kid with too much money. Never expected the real buyer to be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning down, his voice low and warm against her ear, he whispered, &#34;Remind you that you will pay for your lies tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s cheeks turned rosy and she swatted at his chest. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, then I guess we&#39;ll just have to test that out tonight,&#34; Tristan murmured. &#34;I&#39;m done playing nice.&#34; Megan bit her lip, grinning like she already had a few guesses about tonight&#39;s plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Rachel came bouncing over and hugged Megan&#39;s arm. &#34;Sis! You&#39;re seriously Lila Moore? Holy crap! My brother really hit the jackpot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned close and whispered, &#34;Looks like that Lewis-Lee family marriage isn&#39;t happening anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel beamed. &#34;You&#39;re awesome, sis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Mia hurried over and handed over Megan&#39;s clutch. &#34;Lila, your phone&#39;s been buzzing non-stop.&#34;Megan grabbed her purse and pulled out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unknown number kept calling non-stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally picked up, and a panicked, muffled voice came through, &#34;Sis... don&#39;t come... Molly&#39;s lost it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Megan&#39;s face disappeared at once.That was Chloe&#39;s voice-she was sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at the time told her school had just let out. Her first thought? Chloe had been kidnapped by Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well well, look at you, my superstar sis! LiMo,huh?That contest was wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes turned cold. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old car lot out west. Come alone. Bring the cops or Tristan, and I&#39;ll make her pay, big time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll comne.But if she so much as loses a hair-you&#39;re dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, sinister laugh answered her, &#34;You think you&#39;re in control now? Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the call cut off, leaving Megan burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Tristan. &#34;Molly&#39;s taken Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows furrowed. He hadn&#39;t allowed any of the Shaw family to attend the event to avoid trouble.He&#39;d even stationed ten bodyguards at their estate-and four more to watch over Chloe during her commutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she still get snatched?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan&#39;s phone started ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, and Kevin&#39;s anxious voice came through. &#34;Tristan! Chloe&#39;s gone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan immediately reached for the phone. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She begged me to take her to the show. I picked her up after class and dismissed the guards... On the way, she hopped out to buy flowers, and that&#39;s when it happened-l waited forever, but she never came out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan inhaled sharply, pissed off beyond words.That dumb mutt really messed up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up and looked at Tristan. &#34;Molly said to come alone and make the trade...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way,&#34; Tristan cut in. &#34;It&#39;s too dangerous.You&#39;re the real target here. Molly couldn&#39;t have pulled this Nova Tech off alone-someone&#39;s behind her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan reached out and held his hand. &#34;I know it&#39;s risky,but I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stared at the stubborn gleam in her eyes and relented. He brushed her hair gently. &#34;Fine. But I&#39;m coming too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded-it was the only compromise he&#39;d make.If she refused, she wasn&#39;t getting anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re probably watching us. We&#39;ll take separate cars. You follow close behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel tugged at Megan&#39;s arm. &#34;I&#39;m coming too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous,&#34; Tristan snapped,then turned to Kai. &#34;Make sure she gets home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Megan and Tristan&#39;s figures slipped away,disappearing from the crowd&#39;s view.</p>
