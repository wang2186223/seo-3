                <p>Backstage lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each contestant had their own private room-just enough space for changing, doing makeup, and catching their breath before hitting the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had crafted six dresses in total. When she submitted her entry, she picked her top three for the official lineup-the ones she had the most confidence in. She saved these stunners for the finals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant for the semi-finals, Zoe, Jane, and Rebecca were each dressed in the remaining three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chose outfits based on each model&#39;s skin tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca had that sun-kissed, slightly tanned skin, so Megan went with a deep blue gown that shimmered like candlelight. It had a plunging V-neck that hugged the figure just right and a sleek cut that revealed her bare back-not too much, but just enough to make heads turn. Sexy but still classy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s the brilliance of Lila Moore&#39;s design flair-it pulls you in while still keeping you at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane, on the other hand, had porcelain-like fair skin,which meant she could basically rock anything.Megan picked a soft lilac knee-length dress that fit her like a glove, accentuating every delicate curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodice was detailed with emerald and sapphire stones, and from the waist fell layers of gossamer fabric-so light and sheer they looked like mist. Gold and silver threads laced through the skirt, forming intricate patterns that looked practically magical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that dress, Jane didn&#39;t just look good-she looked otherworldly, like a fairy that lost her way to a forest runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Zoe, her skin was on the darker side, so Megan passed her a black gothic lace gown.Zoe slipped into it fast-the layered lace danced with  every movement, drawing an elegant and mysterious silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan curled Zoe&#39;s already wavy black hair and added a bold red lip. Just like that, Zoe looked like a vampire queen-cool, poised, dangerous in the best way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe couldn&#39;t believe Lila Moore herself helped with her makeup. She was beaming, totally hyped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane and Rebecca weren&#39;t about to be left out after that and instantly started begging Megan for their own glow-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the expo hall, it was standing room only.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the hall was somebody-or at least thought they were. Especially those VIP seats,where three men were clearly the center of every debutante&#39;s fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But their whole vibe screamed &#34;do not approach.&#34;Cold auras like that? Anyone with a sense of self-  preservation steered clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights dimmed. The entire space fell into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spotlight hit the back of the stage, and a tall figure stepped into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was suited up, looking polished, and his smile had just the right amount of charm. He walked to the front of the runway like it belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man? John Fairall, the country&#39;s top host. His voice, deep and rich, signaled the start of the competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Imperial Capital Fashion Expo. I&#39;m just your humble little host,&#34; he joked, earning a wave of chuckles and applause. &#34;Tonight, we&#39;re in for a visual feast.Fashion that speaks. Style that stuns. And if one of these designers catches your eye, remember to cast your vote. That one vote might just launch someone into greatness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me break down the rules real quick,&#34; he  continued. &#34;After a nationwide selection, fifteen designers made it to the semi-finals. From here,the judges will pick the top five to move on to the finals.And then, for the final round, it&#39;s all in the hands of both our panel and you lovely people seated here.Together, you&#39;ll choose who walks out of here as champion, runner-up, and third place. The champion? They&#39;ll be named the top designer of the year and even get a collab with none other than our megastar,Jason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(A collective gasp echoed across the hall.)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, let me introduce tonight&#39;s judging panel-three heavyweights in the fashion industry: Jeffery Grant, Elena Glancy, and Sean Greene!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(The room burst into thunderous applause.)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, enough talk. Let&#39;s witness fashion history together. The show starts now!&#34;A retro, mellow tune played, and from the backstage, models in dazzling dresses strutted down the runway with graceful steps. Megan watched the runway show on the lounge&#39;s LCD screen, a slight smirk pulling at the corner of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was hers to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, she originally signed up for the competition because Natalie provoked her, and now that Natalie was in legal trouble waiting for sentencing, Megan still wasn&#39;t about to back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, loads of people didn&#39;t believe in her,claiming she was only where she was thanks to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, tonight, she&#39;d let her skills do the talking-blind them with brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia rubbed her chin, confident. &#34;Lila Moore, there&#39;s no way tonight&#39;s ending in suspense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it didn&#39;t. In the semi-finals, where judges had to score each look without knowing the designer&#39;s identity, Megan&#39;s three dresses pretty much swept the floor-29.7 out of a possible 30. Amelia came in second with a total of 27 points,which honestly wasn&#39;t even close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan narrowed his eyes, obviously impressed. He hadn&#39;t expected his girl to be this talented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course, the buzzing whispers soon kicked in like annoying mosquitoes:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think Megan&#39;s designs look a lot like Lila Moore&#39;s work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard? Lila&#39;s personal tailor and her go-to models are here tonight. Probably means Megan just bought the whole collection from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, with a husband that loaded, dropping billions is probably just a warm-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, I&#39;m so jealous I could cry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Real talent&#39;s what should be respected. If it&#39;s bought-or worse, copied-what&#39;s even the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. I like Amelia&#39;s stuff too. I&#39;ll vote for her later.&#34; &#34;If this round&#39;s up to audience votes, Megan&#39;s not gonna make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows? Maybe the judges&#39;ve been paid off too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People weren&#39;t curious or admiring-they were just bitter and spiteful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t even look back. He knew Megan would shut those rumors down hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel nudged Jason with an elbow and whispered,&#34;Bro, guess you&#39;re working with Megan soon. Didn&#39;t see that coming, huh? She&#39;s actually super legit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave a small nod, then looked over at him side-eyed. &#34;Weren&#39;t you stanning Amelia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel pulled a face. &#34;Nah, I was just trolling. My loyalty&#39;s with the little boss lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unaware that she&#39;d earned a new fan,Megan was in the dressing room, helping models  change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked out the perfect dresses to match each model&#39;s vibe, did their makeup, and styled their hair with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Mia helped out and stuck numeric tags-1, 2,and 3-on the models&#39; arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Megan placed first in semis, she got to use the top three numbers. Amelia&#39;s group used 4, 5, and 6.The rest followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a staff member knocked, signaling the models to line up and get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flopped down on the couch next to Mia, both watching the live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lila Moore, these three are from your original drafts,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded. &#34;Don&#39;t they pop even more than the last set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia nodded so fast her head might&#39;ve fallen off. &#34;Totally! Absolute stunners. There&#39;s just something about your designs-been trying all year to copy your style, but I just can&#39;t capture that spark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a teasing chuckle. &#34;You know what that&#39;s called?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying-too-hard chic?&#34; Mia joked, just as Megan&#39;s playful smile gradually faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her line of sight, Mia looked at the screen-and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her hand, pointing. &#34;Wait...is that-&#34;</p>
