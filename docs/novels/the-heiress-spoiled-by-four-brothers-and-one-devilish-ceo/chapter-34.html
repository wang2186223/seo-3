                <p>In a pastel pink room, Megan sat on the edge of a pink bed, clutching her backpack tightly. Her cheeks were tinged with a soft blush as she looked up at Tristan, who stood towering over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seriously curious what his little wife had been doing in the black market. What had she gone there to buy that might be dangerous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,he was curious-but more than anything, he just didn&#39;t want her getting caught up in something risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slowly unzipped the backpack and silently pulled out two high-voltage stun guns. &#34;Here, these. I got three-keeping one for myself, giving one to Rachel, and planning to give the last to Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the &#39;female products&#39; you were talking about?&#34; he raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded seriously. &#34;Girls need something to protect themselves, especially when they&#39;re out alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,the stuff was real, but did she really need to go all the way to the black market for this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan narrowed his sharp, fox-like eyes. &#34;Anything else sketchy in that bag?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook her head hard. &#34;Nope! That&#39;s all, promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing that he still looked a little skeptical, she didn&#39;t want this to turn into some pointless misunderstanding. So, after taking a deep breath, she pulled out five sets of sexy lingerie from the bag and shoved them into his arms, then bolted off toward the walk-in closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to buy time to hide the listening devices, trackers, surveillance gear, and some medical supplies she had also brought back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everything was safely tucked away, she stepped out again, only to find Tristan still frozen in place,clothes clutched to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over and took a closer look. His usually pale face had turned completely red. His breaths came heavy, like he was fighting off some kind of urge.&#34;What&#39;s with you?&#34; she asked, genuinely puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her soft, worried voice, Tristan tossed the bundle back onto the bed and suddenly scooped her up.sealing her lips with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No idea how much time passed, but all Megan knew was that her back met the plush softness of the bed.Tristan&#39;s warm hand had found its way under her white shirt, steadily tracing upward along her curves until it rested on something soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whispered against her ear, &#34;So. you went there to buy this stuff,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder she went all that way-probably embarrassed to get it somewhere closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And those stun guns? Yeah. she could&#39;ve picked them up from a regular shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, he&#39;d misunderstood his sweet little wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was way too innocent to even know what really goes down in places like the black market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was speechless. Could she admit she only bought the lingerie because, well, it was along the way?Probably best not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her blushing face away slightly. &#34;I thought you might like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s throat bobbed, his voice low and raspy. &#34;Like it? Babe, you could be dressed like a burrito, and I&#39;d still be totally into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan bit her lip, stifling a laugh.&#34;Pervert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in close, he gently bit her rosy earlobe.&#34;Just wait till your birthday-our wedding night. That&#39;s when I&#39;ll really show you what being a pervert means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shameless words kind of turned her on a little.She gave Tristan a light shove. &#34;Hey, you&#39;re crushing me.You&#39;re heavy,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a low chuckle, he rolled off and lay beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sat up, smoothed down her rumpled shirt, then casually grabbed a bright red lingerie set. She opened the clear packaging and pulled it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling it delicate would be an understatement-it was practically see-through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even she couldn&#39;t help blushing just looking at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding it up against herself, she peered up with a mischievous grin. &#34;Honey, does it look good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan slowly sat up, his gaze full of smoldering heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so damn good, it was killing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every pulse in his body was screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little tease was clearly doing this to mess with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow. &#34;Wanna see me try it on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gulped, then felt a sudden warmth drip from his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped it with the back of his hand-he pulled an anime nosebleed just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, startled, grabbed his arm and pulled him toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While cleaning him up, she mumbled, &#34;&#34;Are you okay? You&#39;re probably a little run down. I&#39;ll make you some chicken soup later...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching this oblivious little minx who juşt set his body on fire, Tristan took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her birthday meaning so much, he would&#39;ve lost control right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the bleeding stopped, Megan took his hand and headed back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more for you to see. I brought other styles too, even a little &#39;uniform surprise&#39;. Hey, where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stuck out her tongue at his retreating back. &#34;Let&#39;s see if you can actually hold out &#39;til my birthday.Maybe you&#39;ll explode first!&#34; Tristan fled straight to the guest bathroom for a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After cooling off and slipping into a black silk pajama set, he went looking for her-but the bedroom was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, he bumped into Mrs. Jones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a polite nod. &#34;Sir, ma&#39;am is making chicken soup for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan made his way to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she was-Megan, in a blush pink apron cinched at the waist, white frills fluttering with every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A butterfly clip sparkled in her hair, completely at odds with her usual ice-queen demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred the pot with calm precision, like she&#39;d done it a thousand times-only this time, looking like a domestic fantasy brought to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan came up behind her and wrapped his arms around that tiny waist. &#34;Thanks, babe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set down the ladle, turned with glistening eyes, and asked sweetly, &#34;Hubby, how do I look in my maid outfit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolute killer move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Tristan reached for his nose-thankfully, no blood this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan burst out laughing, threw her arms around his neck, tiptoed, and gave his lips a quick kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nuzzled into his solid chest. &#34;If you really can&#39;thold it in, then don&#39;t. What, you training to be a ninja or buddhist monk something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently pinched her chin and squinted playfully.&#34;You&#39;ve got a dangerous mouth, you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then maybe you should shut me up-with a kiss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned in andkissed him, long and sweet-until the duck soup burned. Tristan softly traced her lips with his finger. &#34;I&#39;ve got a surprise for you.&#34;Megan&#39;s eyes sparkled with curiosity. &#34;You&#39;ve already given me so many gifts. What is it this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A baby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan was shocked by her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took her hand and led her out of the kitchen. When they passed by Mrs. Jones wiping the table, he said,&#34;Mrs. Jones, you&#39;ll be in charge ofdinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Mrs. Jones grinned, watching the couple heading upstairs, her smile full-on auntie mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they stepped into the study, they walked around the desk. Tristan dropped into the leather chair,easily pulling Megan into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened a drawer and pulled out a small box.&#34;Here.Open it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan unwrapped the box and found a ten-centimeter-tall robotic dog inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Press the spot under its tail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-what? That sounds kinda freaky!&#34; Megan raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you scan your fingerprint, it&#39;s officially yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed his instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tiny dog&#39;s eyes lit up blue,its little head turning as it let out two soft barks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a babyish tone, it chirped,&#34;My name is Nova! Wow, are you my beautiful and irresistibly charming master?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked back at him. &#34;So this lttle thing&#39;s fully Al? Another one from Professor XAL?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded slightly. &#34;You like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l do.&#34; Megan&#39;s eyes narrowed like a teasing fox. &#34;But hubby, what&#39;s your deal with Professor XAL? Is XAL a guy or a girl? You two seem super tight. No one&#39;s ever released Al robots with consciousness before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cleared his throat. &#34;He&#39;s a guy. I&#39;ve been funding his research, mostly stuff that&#39;ll help Reid Corp&#39;s future development in tech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which explained why he could afford to donate so many of Professor XAL&#39;s experimental devices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That suddenly reminded her of the talk she had with the shop owner-about that advanced tracking and listening device. She asked, &#34;Do you work with a company called Dracopower?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Yeah, we&#39;ve got some partnerships. Some of Professor XAL&#39;s tech is being applied in communications and satellites. Why do you ask all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled like nothing was up. &#34;Kevin&#39;s company develops that kind of stuff, right? Figured you two must be collaborating. That guy acts like he invented sliced bread, but turns out it&#39;s just my husband backing him up from behind the scenes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Tristan had business ties with Dracopower, she couldn&#39;t just stand by if something went wrong there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting her head lightly against him, she continued, &#34;Babe, with someone like that in charge, that company&#39;s bound to be crawling with corporate spies, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh.maybe not?&#34; Tristan&#39;s response didn&#39;t even convince himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted. &#34;That&#39;s not very reassuring. If you keep working with him, give him a heads-up at least!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Tristan chuckled. &#34;Now, this robot dog&#39;s got tons of features. Let me show you.&#34;</p>
