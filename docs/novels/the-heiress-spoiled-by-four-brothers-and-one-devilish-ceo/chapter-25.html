                <p>The window rolled down a crack, and a breeze tousled the man&#39;s dark, short hair-messy, yet crazy attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand on the wheel, the other tightly laced with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was beating himself up for not going with her to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he realized she&#39;d been gone for over ten minutes, panic hit him hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first thought? She ran off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone in a hurry to check Megan&#39;s location, only to remember she&#39;d left without her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot out of the room to find her, Kevin hot on his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped a couple of employees-Kai and Rachel-asking if they&#39;d seen her, but nope, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a server rushed over, saying he saw a girl in a white dress head into a certain private room-and sounds of a scuffle came from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lost it and stormed into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her safe and sound, his heart finally settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sharp word he&#39;d planned to throw at her dissolved on his tongue. Right then, a crazy thought crossed his mind-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she was okay, what if she did run?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently swore he&#39;d never let her leave his sight again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreamscape Manor. Standing at the entrance, Zeta Prime was waving its mechanical arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, Master and Goddess ! Zeta missed you two sooo much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them paid any attention to the dramatic bot and walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Environmental scan complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotional and physiological indicators: stable and elevated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Atmospheric conditions: dark sky, optimal breeze-ideal parameters for human mating protocols.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Master is exhibiting high dominance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thermal signature:hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Energy levels: exceptional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conclusion:Master is...statistically irresistible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s mouth twitched hard. What the hell even was that?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of twisted nuts-and-bolts nonsense was that robot spouting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan paused mid-step, turned around with a slow, dark smile and said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zeta Prime... you&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime instantly stopped cackling and-despite not having one-clenched its imaginary butt as it bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan scooped Megan up bridal-style and started up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soft little hands clutched his shirt tight, nervous tension written all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed open the bedroom door, carried her in, nudged it shut with his foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed sunk in deep as they landed on the plush mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at the flushed woman beneath himn, Tristan&#39;s Adam&#39;s apple bobbed. &#34;You ripped your own dress, huh? That what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That teasing tone made her spine shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked her wide, innocent eyes and gave a tiny nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flipping her over, Tristan ended up underneath her as she lay flat against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed into his deep eyes, heat and want swirling inside. His breath skimmed her skin, warm and tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip,shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a loud slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34; she yelped in surprise. Her peachy behind just got smacked-real good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow.&#34; Looking at the pouty little woman sulking at him, Tristan&#39;s tone chilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still planning to wear skirts that short around other men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan puffed her colored cheeks in protest-it&#39;s not like she didn&#39;t have a reason! She turned her delicate face away with a faint &#34;hmph.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another slap. Megan&#39;s brows scrunched as she tried to wriggle away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slap-again.Then a few more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door, Mrs. Jones had just raised her hand to knock and ask about breakfast when she stopped,lips curving in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many gasps, so many slaps, so many&#34;Ow&#34;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No need to guess-something wild was clearly going down in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones sighed to herself: &#34;Lord almighty, things escalated quick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like it won&#39;t be too long till there&#39;s a new little Master or Miss around here.She stifled a laugh,tiptoeing out of the room.Meanwhile,inside was a totally different scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sat up in bed abruptly, hands on her waist, frowning. &#34;That seriously hurt, I&#39;m mad now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curled into a smile as his warm palm wrapped around her slim waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you giggling about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked down and instantly froze. Her fair, slender legs were spread, and she was straddling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That position...way too suggestive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Face flushed, she bit her lip and muttered, &#34;I&#39;m never wearing short skirts again. Let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan flipped her onto her back, his slightly rough fingers trailing along her smooth thighs. &#34;You can wear them-but only for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his head, sealing her lips in a kiss that was both punishment and desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, it softened into something tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally let her go, he glanced at her kiss-swollen lips and leaned in for another quick peck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low and husky. &#34;Babe, if things ever get dangerous, don&#39;t charge in by yourself. You&#39;ve got me, I&#39;m not just for display,got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes shimmered from his kiss. She knew he wasn&#39;t just upset about her tearing her dress,but more because she hadn&#39;t asked him for help and put herself at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared up at him, softly replying, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He planted a kiss on her forehead and whispered, &#34;Good girl. I&#39;m gonna shower in the next room. You should wash up too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she said with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him leave, she suddenly jumped out of bed, pacing restlesslyon the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the thought of what was about to happen got her all giddy inside. She covered her mouth to kill the giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she snapped back- wait, wasn&#39;t she supposed to check out that suspicious van?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,Tristan had told Cameron to handle it on the way back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly, she didn&#39;t trust that goofball completely. Better to see for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After glancing toward the door, she quickly sat at the desk and opened her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumped into the city&#39;s road surveillance system, pulled up all of that day&#39;s footage from the Capital,and saved everything to a folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the download finished, she noticed something weird- someone had hacked into the traffic bureau&#39;s network. All footage from that day had been wiped clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed.Someone was clearly trying to cover their tracks about the van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, her reaction speed had been fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight wasn&#39;t the time to dig further. Right now, she really needed a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dashed into the bathroom. The steady stream of warm water washed away all the chaos from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, she stepped out wearing a robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick blow-dry of her dark curls, she walked into the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted something sexy for bed, but all the options were either too modest or had cheesy cartoon prints. Not the vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a face, eventually settling on a sleeveless nightgown that at least showed off her smooth, pale arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hopped back onto the bed, lying on her side with one hand supporting her head and the other fiddling with the hem of the gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the bedroom door clicked open and Tristan walked in wearing sleek black silkpajamas. His messy black hair and the fringe covering those deep, narrow eyes gave off serious heartthrob energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her lying there, effortlessly seductive without even trying, he couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kicked off his slippers, crawled onto the bed beside her, and pulled her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan bit her lip shyly and nodded, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since her rebirth, she never minded getting close to Tristan. She was willing to give herself to him-completely and wholeheartedly.</p>
