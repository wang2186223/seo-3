                <p>Megan blinked her bright, watery eyes. &#34;No way,there&#39;s no escaping Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; he replied with a satisfied grin, &#34;Mine-and only mine,got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never expected Tristan to be so smooth with words. In her past life, he always came off as distant and cold. This time around, though, she just wanted to spend a lifetime hearing these sweet nothings from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pressed the button for the third floor, guiding her out of the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to pick,&#34; he said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze scanned the floor until it landed on a sleek black Lykan Hypersport worth over three million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan strolled over to a wall stacked with keys,grabbed the one he needed, and led her to the car.The scissors doors lifted with a slick motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine purred to life. Tristan kept one hand on the wheel, the other laced tightly with hers, as they cruised out of the garage and away from the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the city lights blurring past, Megan suddenly realized-it had been half a year since she&#39;d stepped  outside Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry... I&#39;ve kept you locked in for six months,&#34;his voice was low and remorseful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head slightly. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t believed all those lies and refused to hear you out, things wouldn&#39;t have turned out like this. But hey, at least I&#39;ve still got a chance to make it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her honesty hit him hard. He didn&#39;t know how or why she&#39;d changed so much overnight-but he liked it.Liked that she was opening up to him,letting him love her,spoil her, and finally understand her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, they pulled up to Cloud Vogue, the biggest luxury mall in Capitol City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glossy, jaw-dropping car instantly caught everyone&#39;s eye. People on the street paused to try and get a glimpse of who was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes turned sharp with discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan noticed and quickly leaned over to kiss his chiseled cheek. &#34;ChilL. They&#39;re not checking me out-Well,they are dying to know who this rich and..showy person is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a brow, ignoring the first part. &#34;Did you just call me...showy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled, loosening his tie, clearly in a great mood now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that smug look on his face reminded Megan of how flustered he&#39;d been the night before. She decided to tease him a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She casually slid her soft hand onto his thigh and slowly moved it upward. &#34;Then why not turn up the heat? Let&#39;s give them another showstopper like last night&#39;s make-out session?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body tensed in an instant, breath hitching.His voice turned low and rough. &#34;Knock it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her mischievous hand, he growled,&#34;Play with fire again and you&#39;re not getting out of this car.&#34;Megan blinked her clear eyes, playing innocent.&#34;Really? Who was the one who ran off halfway last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was scared. scared I&#39;d hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Megan froze. So that&#39;s what he was worried about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m not a kid anymore. I&#39;m almost twenty, and I&#39;m your fiancée. What are you still worried about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled her against his chest, breath catching.&#34;I want you mine. Forever, with papers and rings to prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes lit up, thumb brushing his jaw. &#34;So... a quick stop at City Hall and I get to call you husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at her delicate face, a smile tugging at his lips. &#34;Then let&#39;s go tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a little nod and buried her face in his chest.  Though... something felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it feel like she&#39;d just walked into a trap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, the scissor doors of the car lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan got out first, walked around to the passenger side, and opened the door like a gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held out his hand in invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her soft hand landed in his palm,he gently helped her out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips brushed against her slightly swollen lips.He hadn&#39;t meant for that to happen-but he&#39;d clearly overdone it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the stares thrown their way, Tristan wrapped an arm around Megan&#39;s slim waist and led her into the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside a luxury boutique, they&#39;d barely entered before Tristan emerged again with two shopping bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it was six.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LX&#39;s clothes and bags suit you. Let&#39;s check them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped into LX&#39;s women&#39;s section,four sales associates came over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All four pairs of eyes instantly locked onto Tristan,practically glued there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man-who didn&#39;t know him? He was the dream guy for teenage girls and bored housewives alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment they saw that impossibly good-looking man holding a Barbie-doll-beautiful girl,their  smiles froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged glances</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, could this be the infamous fiancée of Mr. Reid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it rumored they weren&#39;t on good terms?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t she ditch the engagement party?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what did she do-seduce him back into bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lifted her brow slightly and looked them over.&#34;Like what you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught red-handed, the salesgirls quickly averted their eyes, faces flushing with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slid her arms around Tristan&#39;s neck,rose onto tiptoe, and gave his lips a quick peck. &#34;Eyes off. He&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips curled into a small smile. Well, look at that-his girl had a possessive streak. He liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the sales staff, expression cooling,tone low.&#34;Show me your latest collections-limited editions,runway pieces.Size 100-60-90.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the four salesgirls nodded and hurried off to get the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing him rattle off her exact measurements,Megan&#39;s face flushed a deeper red.How could this guy know her so well?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze slipped to the side, and suddenly she spotted a little girl, around five or six, walking past the store with an ice cream in her hand. She subconsciously bit her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you don&#39;t count her past life,it had still been half a year since she last had any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan caught the look in her eyes.&#34;Want one? I&#39;ll get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded like a pecking chicken. &#34;Yeah,chocolate flavor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan set the shopping bags down on the sofa and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his tall figure disappeared from view, Megan turned back and started flipping through the dresses one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She puffed out her cheeks. The past six months, LX&#39;s designs had been kind of off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted up a sleeveless deep V evening gown in champagne with tiny crystals-a rare one that actually looked decent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a pale slender hand reached out,yanking the hanger toward itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced sideways at the girl trying to snatch it and didn&#39;t let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it fist,&#34; she said coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well!&#34; The girl with shoulder-length purple hair gave a mocking chuckle. &#34;Look who it is. Isn&#39;t that Megan, the one Tristan dumped?&#34;  &#34;Hah,&#34; Megan let out a low laugh.&#34;You brain-dead or something? When did he ever dump me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl yanked the hanger harder. &#34;So what,are you saying you dumped him? Please. Your reputation&#39;s already trash at our university. You&#39;ve been on a break from school for half a year. What, got yourself a benefactor or something? Hahaha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I&#39;ve got one,&#34; Megan casually flipped her dark curls, lips curving in a sarcastic smile. &#34;But he&#39;s the kind of man you&#39;ll never get close to in your lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Amelia, you gotta see this!&#34; the purple-haired girl turned her head and shouted toward a sweet-faced girl nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia walked over and stood behind them. &#34;Natalie,Megan saw that dress first. Don&#39;t snatch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave Amelia a quick glance-she was the heiress of the Lewis family in Lindon City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie Banks scoffed at her. &#34;Well, I&#39;m taking it today.It&#39;s a limited edition. I&#39;ve been waiting forever for this to come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia called over the sales assistant. &#34;Excuse me, is there another one of this dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant apologized, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s only one in the whole country and it&#39;s here in Capitol City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sneered. &#34;That gown costs fifty thousand dollars, Megan. Planning to beg your benefactor for another handout?&#34; Megan&#39;s laugh tinkled like champagne flutes. &#34;Darling,when my silver fox arrives...&#34; She leaned in, voice dropping to a velvet whisper. &#34;...you won&#39;t even qualify to call him sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie suddenly raised her hand and aimed a slap at Megan&#39;s pale face.</p>
