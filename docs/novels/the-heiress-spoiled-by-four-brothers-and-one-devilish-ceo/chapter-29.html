                <p>The sharp &#34;clack-clack-clack&#34; of high heels echoed down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three boys and three girls instantly perked up like they&#39;d just seen their savior. As soon as the femnale teacher walked in, they burst out crying, &#34;Teacher, help us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the three guys slumped on the floor and the three girls fiercely slapping themselves, the teacher&#39;s brows knitted tightly. &#34;What&#39;s going on here? Bullying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly immediately stood up, acting like a model student. &#34;Teacher, there&#39;s just been a misunderstanding.My sister didn&#39;t hit them on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really? Could she sound any more suspicious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like she was defending Megan, but what she actually did was outright say Megan hit someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan casually lifted her foot off the chest of the bleached-blond guy and shrugged. &#34;Yeah, this is bullying alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher strode to the podium, slamming her teaching material down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared right at Megan. &#34;You&#39;re Megan Shaw, right? The one who was on leave for half a year? First day back and already starting fights?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a cold chuckle and settled into the seat where the glasses guy had been before.&#34;|said bullying, but I meant I was the one being bullied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how come they&#39;re al on the ground and their faces are so bruised?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They slapped themselves. As for those lying there-well, guess they couldn&#39;t handle it.&#34; Megan smirked.&#34;Since when does being bullied mean you have to end up totally defeated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went on, &#34;They were the ones who insulted me and made the first move. I just taught them a little lesson. Tell me, Miss-am I not allowed to fight back? And also-what&#39;s wrong with taking a break from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>school? And also-what gives you the right to say I bullied anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those three back-to-back questions, the teacher was completely stumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan then pointed at the security camera above the podium. &#34;If you really want to know what happened between the time I walked in and you arrived, just pull up the footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher took in a sharp breath. Ugh, first class of the new term and it&#39;s already such a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the bruised girls and the boys helping each other up. &#34;You all go see the nurse first. If it&#39;s serious, head to the hospital. As for the medical costs...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked to Megan. &#34;Megan, you can&#39;t just walk away from this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as those six were about to leave, Megan said lightly, &#34;Think you&#39;ve slapped yourselves enough yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three girls instantly burst into pitiful sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher sighed deeply. &#34;Megan, sometimes it&#39;s better to let things go. Give others and yourself some space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tapped her finger lightly on the desk.ops, my bad. I&#39;ve always been the no-retreat, no-mercy type.Especially...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to glance at Molly, her gaze sharp. &#34;Especially toward people with nasty intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked back at the three girls, her voice cold as ice. &#34;Do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The classroom went dead silent. Only the loud, crisp slaps echoed in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan casually clapped along with the rhythm in midair, almost like she was enjoying a beautiful symphony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the noise died down, she pulled out her phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was soft and aggrieved. &#34;Honey/, I got bullied at school. Can you send Linus Blake over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;Mhm, okay. Love you too. Muah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone sucked in a breath. She&#39;d just beaten them to a pulp and still had the nerve to act all pitiful and call in a lawyer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait-Linus Blake? Isn&#39;t he, like, the top lawyer in the country?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on-who the hell is her husband?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Principal Scott pushed the door open. He froze for a second at the scene before him, then frowned deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1n a serious voice, he asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on? I just saw a livestream on the alumni site.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three boys and three girls instantly started crying and complaining, talking about being beaten-of course skipping the part where they started it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy with glasses adjusted them calmly. &#34;Principal Scott, they insulted Megan first and threw the first punch. They just got beat because they picked the wrong target. As for the girls, that was all self-inflicted.You can check the surveillance footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl whimpered, &#34;Principal Scott, it was Megan who told me to slap myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tilted her head, smiling slightly. &#34;Then if I tell you to eat sh*t, you gonna doit too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Principal Scott turned to Megan with an almost too-friendly smile. &#34;Miss Shaw, you&#39;re not hurt, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone: [Principal Scott, are you blind?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Principal Scott straightened up, serious again. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure this whole incident is investigated thoroughly.No favoritism, no cover-ups. And nowN, or behalf of Meridian University,like to thank Miss Megan Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow. What, they gonna give her a medal for slapping jerks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else was just as stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Shaw has personally donated a library to our university-a facility with a floor area of 300,000 square meters. She also arranged for the import of advanced research equipment from abroad, including many developed by Professor XAL himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished speaking, the girls who had been sobbing just now instantly shut up. The whole classroom was dead quiet-you could hear a pin drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan knew all of this came from Tristan. The man really knew how to make a statement for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A 300,000-square-meter library? That&#39;s massive. The biggest one in the country so far was only 280,000.This wasn&#39;t just about money anymore-it had escalated to a matter of reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that instrument developed by Professor XAL? Practically impossible to get your hands on a single one,let alone a whole batch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now those six-three guys and three girls-finally realized they&#39;d messed with the wrong person. Regret was probably eating them alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagine getting beat up and then being sued on top of that-by one of the top lawyers out there, no less. They looked like they&#39;d rather crawl into a hole and never come out. If this ended up dragging their families down too, they&#39;d be done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All six of them were pale and miserable-no trace of their earlier bravado left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As for the medical bills?&#34; Megan glanced at the three guys with a smirk. &#34;Self-defense. I&#39;m not paying a dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to the three girls, tone cool.&#34;And you three did it to yourselves. Nothing to do with me.Once my lawyer gets here, you&#39;ll be hearing from him-defamation and slander, both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled slightly at Principal Scott. &#34;Principal, would you mind taking them to your office? My lawyer will meét them there. Also, I&#39;d appreciate it if you could pull up the classroom surveillance footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Principal Scott nodded quickly. &#34;Of course. No problem at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a stiff glance at the teacher and said sternly, &#34;Continue with the lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to lead the six students out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Principal Scott, hold on a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a finger, pointing at the three girls sitting in the back row-Lillian and her friends. They looked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like they wanted to disappear into their seats, not daring to even lift their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget those three. If the hallway cams are working, they&#39;ll show exactly what happened ten minutes ago. And even if they&#39;re broken, I&#39;m pretty sure more than a few students saw what went down. Someone&#39;s bound to speak up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Principal Scott&#39;s face darkened. These kids were really pushing their luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of all the people they could&#39;ve picked on, they had to mess with Tristan&#39;s wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped, clearly annoyed, &#34;What are you waiting for? Move it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian and her friends looked like frightened puppies, heads down, trailing after him out of the classroom without ever daring to look Megan in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned to the teacher and gave a polite smile. &#34;Next time, maybe double-check the facts before speaking.Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she strolled down the aisle and took her seat in the back row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher, visibly uneasy, resumed the lesson-clearly shaken by how badly she&#39;d misread the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the bell rang, she bolted outlike something scary was chasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students didn&#39;t waste time either. Everyone rushed out the door like their lives depended on it-no one wanted to risk upsetting Megan, not even by accident.</p>
