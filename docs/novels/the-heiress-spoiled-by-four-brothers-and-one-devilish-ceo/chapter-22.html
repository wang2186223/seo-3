                <p>The Prestige Nightclub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach rolled up to theentrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped out and opened the door for Megan, taking her delicate white hand and helping her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one arm around her waist, he was ready to head in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Rachel hasn&#39;t gotten out yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan glanced at the backseat. &#34;She&#39;s got hands; and she can open the door herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, watching the couple walk away without so much as a look back, Rachel huffed and pulled the door open on her own, hopping out to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously, she&#39;d just witnessed the definition of double standards in action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed behind them, sulking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff at the nightclub all greeted Tristan with deep bows, calling him &#34;Mr. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed open the door to private room 2121.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke filled the room, swirling like a dream-or a bad hangover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red-haired Kevin bounced over, going in for a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could make contact, a long slender finger pressed against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hands off, please. No touchy from strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing away some smoke, Kevin squinted and let out a gasp, eyes nearly popping. &#34;Holy crap! Drama Queen incoming!&#34; Instantly, the temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows drew together. His voice turned ice cold. &#34;Apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin scratched his head and grinned sheepishly. &#34;MMy bad, My Queen. Come on in, make yourselves at home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them head inside, he finally let out a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,pain shot up from his foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down-someone else in a red dress had stepped right on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!Who-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked over her shoulder with a dazzling smile. &#34;Hi, it&#39;s me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin instinctively glanced toward the guy sitting in the corner, giving him a sympathetic glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bro...good luck,man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He casually hit the smoke exhaust button, then slumped into a single lounge chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the misty vibe cleared, and the room breathed normal air again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan started with intros. &#34;That guy in the corner with the not-so-memorable face? That&#39;s Kai Lee. His family runs the whole frozen food game in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai raised his wine glass and nodded toward Megan. &#34;Nice to meet you, Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that lone soul over there? That&#39;s Kevin Ward. His family&#39;s in telecom hardware. Not that it matters for him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s mouth twitched. Saying Kai has a not-so-memorable face? Fine, maybe a bit harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back at the couch. The girl in red had already melted into Kai&#39;s arms like jelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan finished him off with, &#34;Honestly, he&#39;s just some random dude.&#34; Kevin pulled a face, rolled his eyes so hard they did a loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he switched tactics, pasted on a warm smile, and raised his glass toward Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s for you,Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Good manners. Tristan and I are officially married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pfft-!&#34; Kevin choked, red wine spraying everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Congrats,though!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, weren&#39;t you fasting just two days ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this drama queen cooking up another twisted plan to mess with his buddy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that he&#39;d dare say that out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai gently moved Rachel&#39;s head off his chest. &#34;Congrats, you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pressed her lips together, trying not to laugh. She&#39;d been wary of Rachel before-young, pretty,adopted daughters don&#39;t exactly scream innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious. Rachel had her eyes on Kai, no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned in, speaking low. &#34;Rachel met Kai in France. She&#39;s been into him for two years. Came back to Verduria with her aunt this time... all for him.&#34;Megan didn&#39;t expect Rachel to be so hung up on Kai. Curious,she turned slightly to glance at Tristan and asked, &#34;Wait, is he...you know, into guys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled. &#34;Nah, the Lee family&#39;s got an engagement lined up with the Banks family. You remember the girl with the green hair you saw last time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean Natalie Banks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded. &#34;Yep. The Lees would never let an adopted daughter officially marry in.&#34; Megan frowned slightly.&#34;Then what&#39;s Kai&#39;s deal? Doesn&#39;t like her but won&#39;t reject her either?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, Tristan replied, &#34;He does like her. He&#39;s just scared she&#39;d get hurt. The Lee family&#39;s ruthless, and the Banks aren&#39;t pushovers either. It&#39;s easier to shield someone from open attacks-those sneaky ones are the real threat. And let&#39;s face it, Kai doesn&#39;t have the clout to protect her from both families right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan drew in a breath. &#34;So what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze darkened. He picked up the lemon water from the table and took a sip. &#34;Technically, that should be her man&#39;s job. But I&#39;m not about to let anything happen to Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Megan thought. The &#34;ice king&#34; Tristan was a softie underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Kevin strutted onto the dance floor like it was his personal stage and started showing off moves like he was auditioning for a backup dancer gig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai rolled his eyes and walked out. Rachel instinctively followed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kevin launched into a series of over-the-top dance moves-complete with finger guns and body rolls-Megan leaned over to whisper to Tristan, &#34;I&#39;m gonna slip away to the bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan started to get up with her, but she quickly added under her breath, &#34;Better if one of us stays. If we both leave, it&#39;s just Kevin dancing alone in the spotlight. that&#39;s secondhand embarrassment waiting to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way down the hallway, heading toward the restroom. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed two people making out in a shadowy corner near the emergency exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked. &#34;Honestly, they kinda look good together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After using the bathroom, Megan turned to head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when she noticed a bald guy dragging a familiar figure into a nearby private room. Her eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pigtails, small frame, school backpack-that was Chloe. In her past life, Chloe had been murdered. The mastermind? Molly. No doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, Chloe had gotten caught up in the whole mess after Bernard&#39;s murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? Things were unraveling sooner than expected. Molly wasn&#39;t even trying to hide her plans anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Megan couldn&#39;t help but blame herself-she hadn&#39;t kept a close enough eye on Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted real-time updates on her moves, she needed to plant bugs and trackers ASAP.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, she bolted toward the room. Just as the door was about to close, she slammed her foot into it and kicked it wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, four sleazy-looking men were already lounging around. The bald guy turned, flashing yellow teeth and a sleazy grin. &#34;Well, well, what do we have here? Another one walks right in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes went ice-cold. So cold, it felt like even the air around her froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists clenched so tight her knuckles cracked audibly. &#34;Let the girl go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy sneered, chucking the unconscious Chloe onto the couch toward the other men. Then he turned to Megan, cracking his neck. &#34;Damn, look at that face, that body... You&#39;re a whole damn snack.C&#39;mere, baby, let me show you a good time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled sweetly, lifting a hand with a &#34;hold up&#34; gesture. &#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy paused, his eyes gleaming with greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan reached down and ripped her long dress with a quick&#34;rrrip,&#34; turning it into a mini dress with one swift move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald guy burst out laughing.&#34;Well damn, this chick&#39;s got some flair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guys on the couch snickered too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping the torn fabric tightly around her fists, Megan tilted her head and gave a mock-sweet smile.&#34;Flair? You mean stupid.&#34;</p>
