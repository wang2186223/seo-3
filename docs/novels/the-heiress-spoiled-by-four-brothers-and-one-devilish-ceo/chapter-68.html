                <p>Early next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan left for the office early-he had a big video meeting to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Megan drove alone to Meridian University,waiting by the gate for Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, Rachel slid into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan handed her a dessert. &#34;Grabbed this from Fuki&#39;s Sweets on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being this nice for no reason? Feels fishy.Ow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Megan smacked her lightly on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch! That hurt,Meg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled. &#34;Well, you&#39;re not totally wrong</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, we&#39;re skipping class together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Skipping class? Heck yeah,living the dream!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s lip twitched. Typical slacker-totally proud of cutting class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, where are we off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pulled a laptop from her bag. A crowded map popped up with one little red dot blinking on it. &#34;We&#39;re ghost hunting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?? Ghosts?&#34; Rachel blinked, but Megan was already stepping on the gas, the car zooming off after that red dot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Megan told Rachel to text Kai,have him follow along quietly, and not to breathe a word to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the red dot stopped at a narrow walkway between a café and a sushi bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel hopped out and crouched behind a wall, camera in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel whispered, &#34;Wait a sec, isn&#39;t that Aunt Sophia?What&#39;s she sneaking around for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s ghost-watching,&#34; Megan muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Rachel needed to grasp this wasn&#39;t some random errand. She watched Sophia, wearing sunglasses, constantly glancing around-total sketch vibes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Rachel felt a weight on her shoulder.She turned to see Kai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with all the cloak-and-dagger stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel raised a finger to her lips, &#34;Shhh. Aunt Sophia&#39;s cheating. We&#39;re here to bust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai let out a low whistle. &#34;Whoa, hardcore. Trying to collect dirt for Uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes.&#34;.&#34; Not long after, a young guy with bleached-blond hair showed up, cigarette dangling from his mouth, eyes sharp and twitchy. He handed Sophia a small white envelope; she gave him a fat brown folder in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech, the robot Megan brought, captured the whole shady exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel whistled. &#34;I mean, wow. Didn&#39;t think someone her age would be popping pills. Maybe that night&#39;s big screen drama really wrecked her nerves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel grinned toward Kai, &#34;Too bad you didn&#39;t see it,bro. That scene was pure chaos, unforgettable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai bonked her lightly on the head. &#34;You want me checking out other women.now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel giggled, &#34;Nope! Only allowed to look at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took a deep breath. &#34;Kai, your job is to catch the young guy and make him talk. We need answers -whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Kai finally understood why he got dragged into this-manual labor. But hey, she was Tristan&#39;s wife, and when she said &#34;whatever it takes,&#34; it oddly sounded cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He vanished like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel took off, following Sophia at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia, for some reason, decided to play the good housewife today. She loaded up on fruits, vegetables, and meat at the grocery store before heading back to the Reid family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dumped the groceries in the kitchen,which left the maids stunned. A pampered woman like Sophia,who never even peeled a fruit, actually went grocery shopping herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked around and was told Mr. Reid was in the study, playing chess with Bruce.She quickly adjusted her sad expression and walked over to greet Mr. Reid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,Nathan&#39;s already asked for a divorce. I&#39;ve signed the papers too. Today&#39;s probably my last day in the Reid family. I wanted to cook for everyone myself,one last meal before I go. After all, I&#39;ve been part of this family for so many years. it&#39;s hard to let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid sighed. &#34;Sophia, I can&#39;t interfere in matters between you and Nathan. But I still care about Wyatt&#39;s situation-he&#39;s my grandson after all. I&#39;ve already asked Tristan to send people to investigate. Don&#39;t worry too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan again? Always Tristan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the hell hasn&#39;t that man dropped dead yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And where the hell is her son right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia kept her grateful smile on the surface, but inside she was boiling with hate. If Mrs. Reid was still alive, there&#39;s no way she would&#39;ve let Nathan divorce her. And Tristan? He wouldn&#39;t have become the head of the family. As for that nobody Megan? Dream on about stepping into the Reid household. But too bad-for her, there&#39;s no &#34;if&#34; in life. She couldn&#39;t care less about what Mr. Reid said about Wyatt. His &#34;concern&#34; didn&#39;t move her one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,she was ready to burn every bridge behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had to go down, nobody was getting out clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded gently, squeezing out a few crocodile tears. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ll go start cooking. Could you please let everyone know? I&#39;d like to say goodbye properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid watched as she dabbed her tears and walked out of the study. He dropped the chess piece in his hand with a heavy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? The marriage I didn&#39;t approve back then is finally falling apart. My wife won&#39;t rest easy even in the afterlife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce let out a belly laugh. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you start worrying about whether you&#39;re gonna see your wife again soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid scoffed, &#34;Not yet. I want to meet my great-grandkids first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce flicked a white piece right on top of a black one &#34;You know what they say-people who act too nice when they don&#39;t need to usually have bad intentions.And when they show up with a favor out of nowhere?Definitely plotting something nasty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid&#39;s hand slipped-the black chess piece crashed into the board, ruining the game in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lunchtime, family gathering. The dining table was packed with mouthwatering dishes. Everyone from the Reid family was present,except Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,not really a surprise. He&#39;d already been removed his name from the will-technically, he&#39;s no longer part of this family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s eyes looked puffy and red, her voice thick like she&#39;d been crying for hours. &#34;I&#39;ve been a part of this family for twenty-five years. Never thought I&#39;d be walking away from such a warm home. It&#39;s all my fault.I wasn&#39;t a good wife, nor did I raise my son right. I&#39;ve brought a lot of trouble over the years. Just wanted to have one final meal with all of you-chances are, there won&#39;t be another. Here&#39;s a toast from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she tilted the glass back and downed the wine in one go. Then wiped the corner of her mouth,scanning the faces around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood with a smile, raising her glass. &#34;I don&#39;t hold my liquor well, Sophia. Mind switching drinks with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia froze, clearly caught off guard. Her smile twitched.&#34;Oh...maybe Tristan could drink for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked up Tristan&#39;s glass too. &#34;We&#39;re trying for a baby. Doctor&#39;s orders-no alcohol for either of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised an eyebrow. &#34;Trying? Since when?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn stood up quickly, lifting her own glass. &#34;Well,then let me toast my lovely cousin first.&#34; Megan held up a hand.&#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently slid both glasses toward Evelyn,still smiling &#34;You&#39;ve always had a strong tolerance, Auntie. Why not toast Sophia for the both of us?&#34;</p>
