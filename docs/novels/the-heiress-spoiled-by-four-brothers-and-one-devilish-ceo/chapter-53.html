                <p>Tristan sighed inwardly. That sharp tongue of hers?Sometimes, it did come in handy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled Megan in by the waist, heading straight for the exit, with Cameron trailing behind, lugging a bag full of auction goodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron couldn&#39;t help but feel a little gleeful. Finally,he wasn&#39;t the only one getting roasted by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even talked back to a movie king-now that&#39;s balance in the universe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offstage,Lenna and Jessica Lunnon looked toward Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments ago, Amelia had confidently claimed that the necklace Jason bought was surely for Mrs.Lewis.And then,bam-reality hit her hard, just minutes after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lenna leaned closer, a smirk playing on her lips.&#34;Wow,Amelia, didn&#39;t see that coming. Your brother really gave that necklace to some woman he barely knows?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica scoffed. &#34;For real though, your brother&#39;s so extra. Could&#39;ve at least given it to you,right? Instead,he gifts it to some random chick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia quickly pulled herself together, forcing a smile. &#34;Megan must be pretty special. I mean,even the top man in the country is smitten with her. It&#39;s no surprise others would be too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, that sounded fine. But the subtext?Clear shade-basically calling Megan some kind of expert in playing men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted Jason and Samuel stepping down from the stage and swiftly approached, all sweet and ladylike. &#34;Hey,Jason,Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave a brief nod. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia beamed. &#34;Came with some friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should head back early,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she replied. But the second they turned, her smile faded instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That necklace? He&#39;d rather gift it to a stranger than to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave Samuel a sideways glance. &#34;You really can&#39;t stand her, huh? Couldn&#39;t even say hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel brushed his bangs back with a snort. &#34;Please.She looks innocent, but trust me-total wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing. You know how many times she&#39;s messed me over since we were kids?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled his eyes. &#34;Textbook fake nice girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw an eye at Jason. &#34;You&#39;re literally a top-tier actor.How are you falling for Amelia&#39;s act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason let out a short laugh. &#34;As long as she doesn&#39;t cross the line, there&#39;s no need to call it out.&#34;  A sudden noise from an argument broke out, making the two freeze and glance toward the left hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three girls were locked in a tense standoff-Megan,Rachel,and Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here&#39;s what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie, still inside the venue, spotted Rachel near the entrance, she immediately stormed out,obviously ready to unleash some fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ended up shoving each other all the way to the bathroom entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan, Megan, Cameron, and Kai walked out from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai was about to rush over, but Megan stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is between girls. You stay out of it. You all, wait outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it flatly and strode straight towards the scene like she owned the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Greenhead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned and glared. &#34;Mind your own damn business! This isn&#39;t about you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stepped forward, pulling Rachel behind her,her look cold and steady. &#34;Not my business? That&#39;s my best friend-we&#39;re basically family. You mess with her,you mess with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Natalie swung at Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could land anything, her wrist was caught  mid-air in a tight grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, calm as ever, shot her a deadpan look.&#34;Greenhead, you&#39;ve really got a death wish, don&#39;t you?You sure you still want this hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhh! Let go! It hurts! Dad! Mom! Help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Richard and Nancy rush out of the hallway,Natalie screamed bloody murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Richard caught sight of Megan, his tone flipped like a switch. He forced a smile. &#34;Oh! Mrs. Reid -this must be a misunderstanding, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy, aware this was Tristan&#39;s wife and not someone to antagonize, was overwhelmed by worry seeing Natalie&#39;s twisted expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, trying to ease the situation.&#34;Let&#39;s not make a scene, Mrs. Reid. Our daughter&#39;s a bit impulsive-if she&#39;s wrong, we apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, wrist still twisted and crying, threw one last tantrum. &#34;Dad, Mom! That b*tch next to her is Rachel -she&#39;s the one seducing Kai!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her mouth, there was a sharp crack, followed by her agonizing scream echoing down the corridor.</p>
