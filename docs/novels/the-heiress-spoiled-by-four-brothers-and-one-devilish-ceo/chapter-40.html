                <p>Throughout the entire match, all she could hear were cries of pain, the crunch of bones snapping,and heavy thuds hitting the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, it was drowned out by the roars of the crowd and the shrill screams of the rich ladies in the stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured that scar-faced guy must&#39;ve won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision finally cleared up, and Megan looked up to see the scarred man cloaked in black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His opponent lay motionless on the ring, blood dripping from his mouth and pooling around him. His chest wasn&#39;t moving at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah...he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They signed a death waiver before the fight,&#34;Tristan explained to Megan. &#34;Whatever happens in the ring,the arena doesn&#39;t take responsibility. People&#39;s lives here? Might as well be dust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the referee raised the scar-faced guy&#39;s arm and yelled, &#34;Tonight&#39;s champion is Daniel Flynn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniel didn&#39;t look the least bit proud-he seemed totally out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No speech, no pose-he stepped off the stage and made straight for the locker room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan got up, still holding Megan&#39;s hand.&#34;Come on, let&#39;s go catch ourselves a rat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wading through the packed crowd, they headed backstage toward the locker rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly, no one stopped them the whole way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave Tristan&#39;s big hand a squeeze. &#34;Babe, doesn&#39;t this seem a little too easy? Something&#39;s off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave her a half-smile. &#34;Silly girl, you didn&#39;t actually think it was just the two of us here for this, did</p>
