                <p>Megan sat in the last row by the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the teacher turned to write on the board, she slipped out of the classroom without a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t drive today-left her car at school on purpose because Tristan&#39;s car had a tracker. No way she&#39;d risk it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since her rebirth, her goal was clear-put Molly and Wyatt behind bars, and make them pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already planted the tracker on Molly&#39;s phone. Now, it was Wyatt&#39;s turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So here she was, heading to the hospital to get the job done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cab pulied up at the entrance of Benevita Hospital&#39;s inpatient building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a baseball cap, mask, and sunglasses, Megan slung her backpack over her shoulder and walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way up to the tenth floor-Benevita Hospital-and quietly slipped into a janitor&#39;s closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed into a nurse&#39;s uniform, put on the cap and mask, grabbed the syringe she&#39;d prepped, and walked into the nurses&#39; station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One nurse was busy preparing meds for Wyatt, getting stuff ready for a dressing change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it,&#34; Megan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse blinked, &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just got assigned here. Intern,&#34; Megan replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse remembered there was a new batch starting today. Plus, she needed the bathroom anyway.&#34;Alright, help me out. Room 3-Wyatt Reid.&#34; &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the nurse dashed off, Megan casually injected a heavy sedative into the antibiotic vial, then pushed the medical cart out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Room 3 was a private suite-Wyatt was the only patient there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up as she walked in. &#34;Some kind of checkup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just changing the dressing,&#34; she replied, altering her voice a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t question it, eyes glued to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swapped out the empty bottle for the full one and tidied up the medical trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Wyatt slumped over,unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan darted to his bedside, grabbed his phone, and began installing the tracking software.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done in under a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rebooted the phone and reopened the last page he&#39;d been browsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gross. Dude was checking out adult sites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at that face she couldn&#39;t stand, she really wanted to give him a dose of air and send him to hell. But that wasn&#39;t her way-revenge wasn&#39;t about becoming a monster like them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the cart out without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the janitor&#39;s closet, she grabbed her backpack and left the tenth floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed out of the nurse uniform in a women&#39;s restroom, then walked out of the hospital like nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once back at Meridian University, she opened her laptop inside her car, hacked into Benevita Hospital&#39;s surveillance system, and edited herself out of the video footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just to be extra careful, she also put up a firewall so tough even that so-called &#34;God of Hackers&#34; couldn&#39;t crack it. Meanwhile, in a computer science class, a guy suddenly sneezed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned, feeling something was off. Probably that idiot BlackWing making jokes about him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the bell rang, he packed up his laptop, notes, and a blinged-out Boheme Royal fountain pen, then got ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl with a sweet face blocked his way. She blushed, nervously handing him a box of chocolates. &#34;Hi, uh.Samuel,1.I made these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we all know, Samuel was the heir of the Lewis family. He is not only rich but also handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked annoyed. &#34;I&#39;vegot a toothachehe said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping past her, he walked straight out of the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl&#39;s face crumpled, like she was about to cry.The guy next to her tried to comfort her, &#34;Girl, you&#39;re not alone.Samuel turns down over ten girls a day. Don&#39;t take it too hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another guy chuckled, &#34;Maybe he&#39;s not into girls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl froze. &#34;Wait.does that mean he likes guys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Megan was hurrying to the first lecture hall for her photo-editing class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cries of pain echoed from the nearby grove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got closer, she recognized the person being beaten-wasn&#39;t that the glasses guy who helped her livestream yesterday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was being kicked around by the same three guys who got beat up yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Failing to get back at her, they chose an easy target to let off steam. Really classy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Cowards!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three froze and looked her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had striking features, long black hair flowing down her back, and carried herself with an icy elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,a bleached-blond punk pufled a fruit knife from his pocket, eyes bloodshot and full of rage. &#34;You damn b°tch! You ruined my family&#39;s business! I&#39;m gonna end you today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knife raised, he charged at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s narrow fox-like eyes narrowed, dark pupils locking onto the glint of the incoming blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly reached into the side pocket of her backpack and, in one smooth motion, flung something toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp &#34;awoo!&#34; rang out mid-air, and the next second, a steel dart shot from the object, hitting the bleached-blond punk square in the neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knees buckled, and with a thud, he collapsed and passed out cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The object landed precisely on the ground, then turned toward Megan and trotted over with stiff little steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scared Nova needs a hug! Pretty lady, hold me-awoo~~&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked it up by the scruff, clearly unimpressed, and shoved it back in her bag&#39;s side pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A robotic wolf howling but acting like a scared puppy? Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Useless thing was all bark and no bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova was the robot dog Tristan had given her last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dart just now? Yep-came right out of its mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops, not sure if that dart&#39;s got any nasty viruses like HIV onMegan said,poutng at the two other boys beside the glasses guy. &#34;Wanna give it a try yourselves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other two boys stood frozen, still trying to make sense of what had happened. They couldn&#39;t tell what took bleached-blond punk down, but it was obvious that freaky talking dog had something to do with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on the verge of tears. They hadn&#39;t thought bleached-blond punk would go full psycho and try to kill Megan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All they wanted was to vent a little-no one actually planned on committing murder!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially not against Tristan&#39;s woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two boys&#39; knees started to bend as if about to kneel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh!&#34; Megan scoffed coldly. &#34;Keep your knees. I&#39;m not interested in your groveling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A creepy smile curled on her lips as she crouched and picked up the fruit knife, twirling it between her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without flinching, she used the bladeto flip bleached-blond punk&#39;s right hand face-up, the one he&#39;d been holding the knife with earlier, and drove the knife straight through-clean through his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spattered onto her pale face, making her look wild and strangely enchanting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bleached-blond punk didn&#39;t move, lying there like a dead mutt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slowly stood up, pulled out a wet wipe to clean her hands, then used a compact mirror to wipe off the blood from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humming a cheerful tune, she whipped out her phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the line connected, her expression flipped, voice trembling, &#34;Hi, I&#39;m Megan Shaw,a student at Meridian University. Someone just tried to kill me. I&#39;m really scared. Can you come quickly? I&#39;m behind the first lecture hall, in the little grove.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glasses Guy:&#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two boys:&#34;......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally figured it out-Nova&#39;s totally a mini version of its owner. They&#39;re basically two of a kind.</p>
