                <p>Megan suddenly spun around, having sensed a pair of eyes on her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What met her gaze first were a pair of long legs,followed by a narrow waist and broad shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes slowly traveled up to meet that devilishly handsome face,and her smile froze on her lips. She momentarily forgot to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked. &#34;Hey there, honey...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, her &#34;honey&#34; scooped her up like she was a kitten, carrying her straight back to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;kitten&#34; now knelt on the soft bed, twisting her fingers nervously in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan sat at the edge, pointing to the screen with an alert saying [Recovered].</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WelI, color me surprised. You&#39;ve been holding out on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a sweet grin. &#34;Oh come on, it was just a fluke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tilted her chin up. &#34;A hacker, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, not really!&#34; She grabbed his elegant fingers,slowly guiding them down in an attempt to distract him from the conversation.  As his hand brushed her porcelain-like neck, he swallowed hard, throat bobbing visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly pulled his hand back. &#34;You took down Hacker God. That&#39;s not something just anyone can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned in, the black lace strap of her camisole dipping enough to show a teasing glimpse of her curves. &#34;Babe... I&#39;m sleepy. Can we crash already? I&#39;ve got class tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan poked her forehead,lightly pushing her back.&#34;Codename.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scooted back on her knees, throwing both hands above her head like surrendering.&#34;Okay,okay-but no smacking me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. There was only one hacker he&#39;d truly wanted to wring the neck of-the one who stole two hundred million from his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted coldly. &#34;Blackwing. That&#39;s you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a sheepish laugh. &#34;Surprised? Delighted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled himself up onto the bed, palms pressing down near her as he leaned in. &#34;So, how are you going to make up for that two hundred million you took from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Face-to-face with him, Megan tugged at his firm chest. &#34;Didn&#39;t I help you save ten mil once? Another two mil this time-come on, I&#39;m working on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had barely left her mouth before he was on top of her. He brushed his lips down to her ear, giving the lobe a playful nip. &#34;Let&#39;s call this collecting some interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he covered her lips with his, filling the room with nothing but the sound of heated kisses...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As golden sunlight broke softly through the clouds at dawn,Megan rolled over and cuddled into a warm chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand slipped along her waist under the covers, his husky morning voice brushing against her ear. &#34;Megs,time to wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile tugging at her lips, Megan opened one eye, letting her fingers wander down his sculpted chest before pinching the defined line of his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed. &#34;See what you did? My arms are all bruised!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hooked her legs around his waist, grinning. &#34;Well?Come at me,then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan squinted at her with a smirk, clearly seeing through her little provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ground his teeth lightly. &#34;You really think I won&#39;t?&#34;&#34;Pfft. If you&#39;ve got the guts, go for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she teasingly nipped at his Adam&#39;s apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nuzzled into her neck, breathing in her light scent.&#34;You know what they say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; &#34;Hard bite, funeral.Soft bite. and there might be one more of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed her a grin. &#34;So, what&#39;s it gonna be,Meg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked him dead in the eyes, bit her lip, and smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soft bite sounds good.&#34;Tristan took a deep breath,then bit down hard on Megan&#39;s collarbone before flipping off the bed. &#34;I&#39;ll hold it in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him storm out ofthe room, Megan sat up abruptly-yep, off to take another cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed. Seriously, why wait until her birthday-aka their wedding day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They already signed the papers! This guy had to be obsessing again. So damn stubborn for nothing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling around on the bed with the blanket wrapped around her, she was totally frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still cocooned in the quilt, she crashed to the floor.Lucky there was a carpet, but she still landed face-first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, Tristan burst in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took one look at her bundle-of-a-self on the floor and frowned. &#34;Why are you on the ground?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly raised her head and grinned. &#34;I&#39;m doing some role-playing.&#34; With his long legs, Tristan strolled over. His broad shoulders and narrow waist were on full display, with just a towel wrapped at the waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scooped her up and smirked. &#34;What are you playing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled, &#34;Nah, a... maggot. One from the bathroom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at the adorable mess in his arms, gently set her back on the bed, then rolled with her under the covers. &#34;Alright, maggot-go to the bathroom and wash up already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pursed her lips, but her eyes flicked to his towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyebrows lifted, she started humming in a sing-song voice: &#34;Twinkle twinkle, magic wand, makes big things bigger with just one arm~&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she sprang out of bed and pranced to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s mouth twitched. That song. definitely not rated G.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a dim room across the house-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was brushing his teeth while heading toward the window. He pulled open the grey curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning sunlight spilled in. The weather was nice, and his mood? Even better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, making two hundred grand in one night wasn&#39;t bad at all, even if he wasn&#39;t short on cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down at the desk and flipped open the laptop. The toothbrush paused mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been sniped again?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That damn Blackwing even left a message calling him &#34;Forever the runner-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was straight-up savage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming,Samuel swallowed a mouthful of toothpaste and slammed his toothbrush against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you, Blackwing! If I ever catch you-you&#39;re so dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slumping into his chair, he squinted his foxy eyes.Time to dig into that girl-see if she had any ties to Blackwing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgetting all about the hacker god, both he and Megan finished breakfast and drove out of Dreamscape Manor separately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced into her rearview mirror and saw Tristan&#39;s car following close behind. Her heart warmed with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the gates of Meridian University,Tristan finally turned off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peered into the mirror-to see a cheerful figure bounding toward her car and popping open the passenger door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel beamed.&#34;Morning,sis-in-law!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan started the engine and glanced over as they pulled out. &#34;Everything cool with your aunt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup,all good. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| ran into Natalie yesterday. We&#39;ve got a shared lecture today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel shrugged. &#34;She already knows I&#39;m dating Kai.She saw us together at a Michelin restaurant in France six months ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave her a side-eye. &#34;What, you scared now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Kai&#39;s my man!&#34; Rachel gave a friendly pat to Megan&#39;s flat chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled, &#34;So Kai&#39;s not really into... the dairy section?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel peeked down, then smacked her lightly with a fist. &#34;You&#39;re the worst, Megan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha...&#34;</p>
