                <p>With a crowd circling around, the chubby girl clutched Molly&#39;s arm, shaking it aggressively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face instantly darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh,what an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seriously wanted to slap the girl off to the side right then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colder than ice, Molly&#39;s eyes narrowed, but just as quickly, she looked up with tearful, pitiful eyes like a helpless puppy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, all these years of sisterhood, don&#39;t you care at all?&#34; she sobbed, her voice soft and heartbreaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nice move-like Megan had just dumped a lifelong sister without batting an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Classic Molly. Manipulation queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel snorted. &#34;Oh really? And who&#39;s the one blabbing around campus about how Megan&#39;s kept by some old dude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward, gaze sharp.&#34;What exactly are you trying to do, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stammered, her voice breaking.&#34;1..I never said that. That wasn&#39;t me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tch.Sure, maybe not word-for-word. But girl, you sure dropped enough hints to steer people in that direction. And now you&#39;re just trying to wipe your hands clean? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words bit like knives, the chubby girl jumped in. &#34;And this has what to do with you,exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel stood firm, arms crossed. &#34;Everything, actually. You called my brother an old dude. That&#39;s not okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl rolled her eyes and tilted her double chin up. &#34;And who the heck is your brother? Don&#39;t tell me &#39;your brother&#39; is just your lame code for a sugar daddy too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha,&#34; Megan finally let out à cold laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped up, mocking smile curling on her lips. &#34;Your ugly just makes Molly look better. And your dumb helps her seem smart. That&#39;s probably the only reason she ever tolerated you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar!&#34; the girl fired back, face red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan just sighed, clicking her tongue. &#34;If she really saw you as a friend, then why didn&#39;t she tell you who I&#39;m actually with? Or maybe...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her left hand, showing off the ring on her ring finger.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s because... I&#39;m not being &#39;kept&#39;but married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Married to who?&#34; The question slipped from the girl&#39;s mouth-same question everyone around was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Rachel smirked and lifted his chin. &#34;Let me introduce myself. Rachel Reid. And my brother? Also a Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone collectively gasped. That&#34;old dude&#34; just might be Tristan?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still clinging to hope, the girl snapped, &#34;There are tons of Reids out there. Don&#39;t try to scare me by dropping Tristan Reid&#39;s name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s face glowed with a faint smile. &#34;Wow, sounds like in your head, you already paired me up with him.Gotta say, not boad. You&#39;ve got a decent eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me make this clear-I&#39;m Megan. And my man? Tristan Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dead silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only sound was the loud gulp of the chubby girl swallowing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was over. She was toast. Megan tilted her head and gave her a slight smile. &#34;Being chubby can be cute. But inheriting the mindless bits too? Not so much. Don&#39;t let all that extra fat clog your brain-you can&#39;t even tell a two-faced backstabber when she&#39;s right next to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she grabbed Rachel&#39;s hand and started wvalking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, the crowd parted, giving them a wide path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby girl turned on Molly, furious. &#34;Wow, so that&#39;s the kind of schemer you are? You let us believe Megan was some sugar baby when she&#39;s literally married to Trisan freakin&#39; Reid? You used us like pawns!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fumed, nearly shouting. &#34;And news flash-you&#39;re not even the real heiress to the Shaw family. Just a wannabe trying to fake it till you make it. Ugh! How did we not see through your act before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah...totally blind. Aftersaying that, she dragged her friend and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, classmates were shooting Molly looks full of contempt and disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guess no one expected the harmless little bunny from last year to end up being a manipulative drama queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers and sarcastic comments filled the air as Molly clenched her jaw, grinding her teeth in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stomped her foot angrily. &#34;That witch! I swear I&#39;ll ruin her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 4:30 in the afternoon, two sleek, low-key Bentleys pulled up outside the side gate of Meridian University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Rachel each got into one of the cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engines roared to life, and the Bentleys drove off in different directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside one of them, Tristan was holding the steering wheel with one hand and interlocking fingers with Megan with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had a good day?&#34; She leaned into his solid arm, eyes sparkling. &#34;Yeah, super happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked at him playfully. &#34;Closed a big deal? Stock shot up? Or maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips were curved into a faint smile from the moment she got in. &#34;Because you announced to everyone that I&#39;m your man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect him to be that easy to satisfy. It made her heart ache a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at his sharp-featured profile, she said softly, &#34;Babe, what do you feel like eating tonight? I&#39;ll cook for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as it&#39;s you who&#39;s cooking, I&#39;ll eat anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just gazed at him quietly, feeling sweet all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan opened the car door and helped her out gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the villa, nestled close to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime stood at the door, letting out a snarky robotic laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome home,Master and Goddess. Zeta Prime is 99.7% excited!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alert: Scanners detect a highly suspicious item in the Goddess&#39;s bag. Shall I initiate containment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s heart skipped a beat. It was talking about the bugging device, mini camera, and high-voltage stun tool in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bucket of bolts didn&#39;t know how to shut up but sure knew how to snitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling brightly, Megan replied, &#34;Zeta Prime sure is one capable bot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its eyes flashed. &#34;Tone analysis complete: 87% probability of sarcasm detected.Translation-Zeta Prime is being called a dumbass.&#34; Megan was amused by the robot&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave Zeta Prime a cold glance. &#34;The lawn out front needs trimming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime&#39;s optics rotated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies. Lawn care is not in my job description. My primary functions include boosting morale, offering flirty praise, and identifying peak moments for...romantic escalation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan took a deep breath. &#34;Should we shut it down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze darkened, voice cold. &#34;Do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime zipped its mouth shut in a second, did a full-body spin, and bolted backward toward the east wing of the first fioor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan wrapped his arm around Megan&#39;s slim waist as they headed upstairs. &#34;Meg, what&#39;s really in your bag? I&#39;m kinda curious now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pressed her lips together, cheeks blazing red. &#34;It&#39;s nothing serious. Zeta&#39;s just talking nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Tristan&#39;s grip on her waist tightened slightly. &#34;Zeta&#39;s record with detecting danger has never been off before.&#34;</p>
