                <p>Evelyn was already petrified, nodding frantically the moment Megan finished speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Harrison didn&#39;t say a word-he just raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.The force knocked Evelyn to the ground, a streak of blood trailing from the corner of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison pointed at her, seething. &#34;You bitch. You drank your glass because you knew it wasn&#39;t poisoned.But mine? What about mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew damn well there was poison in my wine,and you didn&#39;t say a word. Were you really trying to kill me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn shot him a hateful glare and growled, &#34;You think I wouldn&#39;t?! You&#39;re out every night screwing around like some lowlife. I hate you, Harrison. I loathe you so much that I wanted my cousin to help me end you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only made Harrison more furious-he kicked her a few more times. &#34;Bitch! You couldn&#39;t even give me a kid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping the blood from her lips, Evelyn spat back,&#34;You really  think that&#39;s on me? You&#39;ve got a low sperm count,genius.Blame yourself.&#34; Harrison froze. &#34;That&#39;s impossible. Josephine is pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. &#34;Then I hope you get a paternity test. Let&#39;s see if that kid&#39;s even yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison clenched his fists, jaw tight with anger, then abruptly turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ryan walked into the dining room with a team of officers, holding an arrest warrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suspect Sophia, you&#39;re being detained for the murder of Ms. Henrietta eighteen years ago, along with attempted murder of other members of the Reid family.The evidence is solid. You&#39;re coming with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Evelyn Carter, you&#39;ve been in contact with the suspect and know a lot about the case.We need your full cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t, we have grounds to charge you with conspiracy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn didn&#39;t want to end up behind bars. She slowly got up, glanced at Sophia, then turned to Ryan and said, &#34;I&#39;ll cooperate. I&#39;ll tell you everything I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was handcuffed and led away. As she passed Evelyn, she muttered a nasty curse under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large group of people followed the police back to the station to give statements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Sophia was injured, she was transferred directly to the prison hospital for treatment and interrogation. Nathan, having coughed up blood from the shock,was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Tristan and Megan accompanied him and handled his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving their statements to three officers, the police finally left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan looked at Tristan, eyes full of guilt. &#34;Tristan, I&#39;m so sorry. If I hadn&#39;t been such a coward... if your grandmother hadn&#39;t threatened me with her life...maybe I wouldn&#39;t have left your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had plenty of resentment toward Nathan,but he understood how torn his father had been between his mother and his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d asked himself many times-if the roles were reversed,what would he have done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never had a clear answer-until he met Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan took Megan&#39;s hand and walked to the door,stopping just before stepping out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look back, but there was a softness in his voice that hadn&#39;t been there before. &#34;The past is over.Mom never blamed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s voice caught. &#34;And you? Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan felt Tristan&#39;s grip tighten. He chuckled lightly and said, &#34;Get some rest, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one word-&#34;Dad&#34;-hit Nathan like a tidal wave.After all these years, he&#39;d finally heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Tristan picked up a bouquet of lilies and drove with Megan to a private memorial park. The place was lush and peaceful, with trees casting long shadows and flowers blooming everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked slowly down a stone path until they reached a calm lake shimmering under the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the left of the lake stood a gravestone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand in hand, Tristan and Megan stood in front of it and bowed deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gently placed the lilies on the ground, looking at the photo carved into the stone. The woman in it-Henrietta-was stunningly beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Tristan&#39;s mother. her mother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear where Tristan got his good looks-his features almost angelic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Henrietta&#34; Megan whispered. &#34;My name&#39;s Megan Shaw. I&#39;m Tristan&#39;s wife. I&#39;m so sorry it took me this long to come see you. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take good care of Tristan.&#34; Megan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled her into his arms with a soft look in his eyes. He gently ruffled her hair and then looked at the tombstone. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m here. I brought Megan with me this time. Thought it was about time you met her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood quietly while Tristan spoke gently to his mother&#39;s grave, sharing all that had happenedrecently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked out of the cemetery, Megan wrapped her arm around Tristan&#39;s waist and looked up at him.&#34;Hey hubby, tell me-when exactly did I move into that heart of yours?&#34; Tristan smirked. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you on your birthday-our wedding day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan scoffed and rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Reid family mansion, they headed straight for the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid and Bruce were playing Go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the two walked in, Mr. Reid waved them over.&#34;Megan, come here! I&#39;ve had enough losing to this guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce snorted. &#34;Please, I&#39;m not wasting another piece playing with someone who takes back every other move. Your chess morals are tragic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two old men bickered non-stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the situation, Tristan and Megan tried to sneak away-only to get called back at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Megan stayed to play with Mr. Reid while Tristan ended up chatting philosophy over tea with Bruce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Bruce sipped his tea, he glanced at Tristan. &#34;From a fate perspective, you and that girl? Your souls are way too entangled in past lives. No breaking that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Past lives? You seeing something,Uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce gave him a deep look. &#34;Would you suffer skin-peeling pain for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan turned his gaze to Megan&#39;s bright profile. A soft smile crept onto his face. &#34;I would. No matter how much it hurts, even if it kills me-as long as it means staying by her side.&#34; Bruce sighed. &#34;Then that&#39;s that. With that stubborn heart of yours, even the Reaper might get soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled. &#34;Uncle, what about the next life?Would we still find each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce took another sip, his eyes twinkling. &#34;As long as love runs deep, fate doesn&#39;t end. But...&#34;</p>
