                <p>The scalding liquid splashing onto the floor drew sharp gasps from the people nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan swiftly dodged, but a few drops still stained the pristine white of her shirt. Her eyes narrowed, that usual fox-like glint now carrying a flash of irritation and a hint of something cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed her backpack into the startled arms of the intern at the reception. &#34;Hold this for me. I&#39;ve got a stray mutt to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she spun around and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flamboyant receptionist burst into mocking laughter. &#34;Look at her! What a coward. Left her bag and ran off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, she saw Megan say something to an old man leaning on a cane across the hall. and the next second, Megan was striding back with that cane in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist&#39;s smug smile froze. &#34;Wait-what are you doing?! What do you think you&#39;re doing?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wasn&#39;t the type to waste her time on arguing when she could fix things with actions. She raised the cane and pressed it lightly against the receptionist&#39;s  chin. &#34;Come out, or I&#39;ll flatten all that filler in your jaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman grabbed the cane tightly. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan yanked it out of her grip and smacked it down right on her chest. &#34;Boom! Bet your silicone&#39;s crying.Next time, maybe don&#39;t go cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp scream pierced the air, turning every head in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s gonna kill me! Someone help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman bolted, but Megan coolly stepped in her way. &#34;You messed with the wrong one. Time for some dog-beating stick action!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running your mouth like a market hag? Deserves a hit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throwing coffee at people? Cold-hearted snake move. Also deserves a hit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ruining the company&#39;s image? Still deserves a hit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eyeing someone else&#39;s man? Oh, that gets an extra hit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lie! I never went after anyone&#39;s man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan delivered a solid smack to her backside.&#34;You were drooling over mine! Maybe this&#39;ll knock some memory into your skull.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hit my butt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sniffed, indifferent. &#34;Honestly? Your face and your butt are equally unfortunate, so I don&#39;t see a  difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist whimpered, &#34;You&#39;re shameless!You&#39;re dreaming if you think the President&#39;s your husband!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t bother clapping back. When one area got shielded, she just switched it up-arm, then legs,then back to arms. Precision strikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the room&#39;s energy shifted, sharp and cold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist froze mid-defensive block, her eyes lighting up like she&#39;d spotted hope in hell. She stumbled away like she&#39;d seen salvation and ran straight toward a tall figure walking over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached out for the immaculate shine of his hand-crafted shoes, Megan swung the cane again,like she was teeing off on a driving range, and whacked her hard from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist dropped to his feet,ready to grab his shoes and sob her way to safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man? He stepped back fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up with wide, watery eyes. &#34;MMr. Reid, that crazy woman is claiming you&#39;re her husband and tried to get into the executive elevator. I know you hate that, so I stopped her. But then she beat me with a cane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brows pinched together. &#34;Cameron, get her out of my building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the floor, the receptionist turned her head and smirked up at Megan. That ugly, smug grin said it all-See? You lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cameron gave a quick wave, and four bodyguards closed in immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They grabbed her, stretching out her limbs like they were about to ship her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You&#39;ve got the wrong person! Kick her out, not me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reid, don&#39;t do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go,you morons!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was chucked outside without mercy, landing hard at the entrance. Curious onlookers stopped to watch the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still trying to charge back in, she staggered up-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only to be met by Cameron again. His voice was ice.&#34;Do you even realize who you just pissed off?&#34;The gaudy receptionist gritted her teeth. &#34;Just a damn homewrecker trying to cling to Mr. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron sneered. &#34;She&#39;s Mrs. Reid. Boss said it himself-he doesn&#39;t want to see you again in the Capitol City. You know what that means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs.Reid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist stood there dumbfounded.When did Tristan get married?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seriously messed with the wrong person</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the surrounding crowd of  onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly exploded, yelling, &#34;What the hell are y&#39;all staring at? Nothing better to do? Bunch of idiots!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She limped forward, massaging the bruises on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone called out behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, she saw her supervisor walking toward her,carrying a box. He tossed it at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks to you, my bonus this month just went up in smoke.Of all people, you had to mess with the CEO&#39;s wife? If that hot coffee had hit her, you&#39;d be spending the rest of your life behind bars. Ugh-bad luck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the building, Tristan was checking Megan carefully from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wrapped her arms around his waist. &#34;Babe, I was really scared just now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold up-who was it chasing that woman with a cane just now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sniffled. &#34;That coffee came flying at me,all steaming and scary. What if it hit my face? What if I got disfigured? What if you stopped loving me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan held her tight. &#34;No matter what you look like,I&#39;ll always be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd: &#34;...Someone call the SPCA-we&#39;ve got extreme PDA going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron sighed. The boss was utterly wrapped around  her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was stunned. This was the same Tristan who supposedly kept women a mile away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a day to be alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right, I need to return that cane to the old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her gaze, they spotted an elderly gentleman not far away, his silver hair gleaming under the lights,his face lit up with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips twitched into a rare smile, and he took Megan&#39;s hand, walking toward the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached, Tristan gave a respectful bow.&#34;Mr. Stewart, what a surprise! You should&#39;ve let us know ahead of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce chuckled. &#34;If I did, would I get to see such a show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eyed Megan up and down. &#34;Whew! She&#39;s got quite a fire in her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Tristan&#39;s deferential manner, it was clear this man was no ordinary elder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, this is Mr. Stewart-he&#39;s like an uncle to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan bowed politely. &#34;Nice to meet you, Mr. Stewart.I&#39;m Megan Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held out the cane with both hands. &#34;Thank you for lending this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted it with a nod. &#34;You&#39;ve got good fortune,kid. Aren&#39;t you the girl who ran away from the wedding  half a year ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was again-her infamous history. Everyone nationwide knew she bailed before the wedding,but no one dared say she&#39;d left Tristan hanging.Somehow,the gossip flipped it the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grinned. &#34;Let&#39;s leave that in the past, yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chimed in with a smile. &#34;Mr. Stewart, shall we head upstairs to chat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce shot Megan a knowing look, then nodded and followed them toward the CEO&#39;s private elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before stepping in, Megan suddenly remembered her backpack. She dashed over to the registration desk where the receptionist girl stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl was trembling, holding the bag above her head. &#34;Mrs. Reid, your backpack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan burst into giggles and took it, slinging it over her shoulder. &#34;The Reid Group needs people like you -treating everyone with courtesy and fairness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the name tag-still an intern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled warmly.&#34;Starting today,you&#39;re officially on the team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman stared after her, filed with gratitude as Megan walked away with that spirited bounce in her step.</p>
