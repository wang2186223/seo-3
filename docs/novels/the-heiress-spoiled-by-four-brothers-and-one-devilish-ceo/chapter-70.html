                <p>The man was being totally uncooperative,so the two bodyguards grabbed his face to hold him still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his wide, terrified eyes, the reflection of a mechanical dog with wings filled his vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmf! Mmmmf!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared in horror, helpless as Nova Tech calmly tattooed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three minutes later, Nova Tech retracted the steel needle and flew back to Megan&#39;s shoulder like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hovering over the crying man on his knees, it commented, &#34;Oops, Nova might&#39;ve made his mouth look like a clown&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy&#39;s teeth were chattering. The moment that needle started jabbing into his skin non-stop, he knew -his face was done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people around the dining table were all stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially Sophia and Evelyn, whose guilty expressions were impossible to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised an eyebrow and glanced at the man drenched in cold sweat. &#34;Want me to throw in some eyeliner too? Worst case, it gets inked on your eyeballs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova gave an excited &#34;Yoo-hoo!&#34; and zipped toward the man again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! Please! I&#39;ll talk-I&#39;ll tell you whatever you want,just don&#39;t let that thing touch me again!&#34; he yelled out in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan exchanged a look with Kai, who immediately dragged a chair over with a knowing nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down like a queen, her sharp gaze locked on the man kneeling before her. &#34;Then start talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man shot a glance at Sophia. &#34;Last night, a woman called and asked for a poison that kills without a trace. We agreed to meet in the alley between the coffee shop and the sushi place. Just to be safe, I sent one of my guys from an internet café to handle it. Still got caught in the end. Lucky me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes turned icy. &#34;Tell me more about this invisible poison. How does it work? What happens to the person who takes it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept talking, &#34;It&#39;s a small white pill-contains botulinum toxin. That stuff&#39;s lethal. Type-A is especially bad-odorless, colorless, dissolves easily in water.It attacks the nervous system, causes dizziness,trouble breathing, and if the respiratory muscles stop working, death. Just 0.24 milligrams can kill someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned to look at Sophia, her eyes narrowing.&#34;Aunt Sophia, I&#39;m guessing the dose you put in my wine was way more than 0.24 milligrams, right?&#34;  Sophia clenched her fists tight and forced a calm voice, &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan actually liked this type-the ones who insisted until the bitter end. They usually got slapped the hardest by the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her chin at the man. &#34;Eighteen years ago,this same woman also bought that poison from you.Ring any bells?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man studied Sophia&#39;s face closely. She instantly dropped her stare, clearly rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,eighteen years will age most people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia had maintained herself well over the years -sadly, only on the outside. The darkness inside? Still alive and kicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded hard. &#34;It&#39;s her. She bought that same poison from me back then too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying!&#34; Sophia screamed. &#34;They made you say this to frame me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held up his hands. &#34;Look, I remember her because she was stunning. Didn&#39;t expect someone that pretty to be looking for murder drugs. I even gave her a nickname-Venomous Beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia kept shouting her denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it!&#34; Mr. Reid slammed his hand on the table,making her go silent instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Megan. &#34;Go on, Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod. &#34;Eighteen years ago, Tristan&#39;s mom-Henrietta-died because of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s eyes went wide with shock. &#34;No-it wasn&#39;t me!You&#39;re lying! She died of lung cancer! I had nothing to do with it-not me, I swear! Megan,you ruined my son,and now you&#39;re coming after me? You&#39;re seriously twisted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reid, please believe me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a light tap on Nova Tech perched on her shoulder. &#34;Go ahead, pull up the footage from that killer&#39;s room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova jumped up on the dining table and stuck its rear up as it played a surveillance clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On screen, Sophia was seen pulling out a phone from the drawer and dialing a number, asking for a drug that could kill without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a call from Evelyn, and their whole exchange played loud and clear for everyone to hear -along with Sophia&#39;s cold, vicious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh scraping sound followed as chairs pushed back. Both Nathan and Tristan stood up at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan got to her first. Furious, he lunged at Sophia,grabbed her by the neck, and hoisted her off the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You venomous thing! You played dirty! When Henrietta brought Tristan back to me, I used everything I had to find her, to get her treated. Who would&#39;ve thought you were the one pulling strings from the shadows, killing her!&#34;  Sophia&#39;s face turned red. She clawed at Nathan&#39;s arms,eyes rolling back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan walked over and held Tristan&#39;s shaking hand,then looked at Nathan, softly calling out, &#34;M. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brought Nathan back to his senses. He let go and flung Sophia to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping for breath, she suddenly broke into sobs, &#34;If it weren&#39;t for that damn woman, I wouldn&#39;t have ended up so miserable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan exploded, &#34;If you hadn&#39;t torn us apart... me,Henrietta, and Tristan could&#39;ve had a good life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia laughed scornfully, &#34;Torn apart? Then why didn&#39;t you run off with her back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan gritted his teeth. &#34;If my mother hadn&#39;t threatened me with her death,you think I&#39;d have given in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sneered, &#34;Exactly. In the end, you still picked your mommy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his own choices crushed Nathan; regret clawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after Henrietta left, he&#39;d tried so hard to find her.But in that era, if someone truly didn&#39;t want to be found,you just wouldn&#39;t. Period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like someone pretending to be asleep-you could scream all day and they still wouldn&#39;t wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s throat burned. Blood spurted from his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan caught him and helped him into a  chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai was already on the phone with 911.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped toward Sophia. Kneeling beside her,he looked her dead in the eye, voice like frozen steel.&#34;Tell me,how do you deserve to be dealt with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia started backing away on her hands, toes scraping the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan came up beside him. &#34;Honey, don&#39;t dirty your hands. Let the police handle it. Let her pay by the book.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded rapidly, like a chicken pecking rice. &#34;Y -Yes! Turn me in! I&#39;m willing to take the punishment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced coldly down at her like she was just some bug. &#34;Attempted murder gets death, life sentence, or at least ten years. Don&#39;t worry-you&#39;re looking at the first one. Should&#39;ve been ended eighteen years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No-you&#39;ve got it wrong! That was just nonsense -I neverkilled Henrietta. There&#39;s no proof!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a cold laugh. &#34;This whole meal was prepped by you, and every second of you poisoning the dishes is on tape. You really think this is your first time doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia froze, and the next second,she lunged toward the table like a madwoman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised his leg and kicked her square in the chest. The impact sent her flying over three meters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coughed up blood, but even so, it did nothing to ease the fury burning in everyone&#39;s hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave Evelyn a sideways glance. &#34;Aunty,covering for her makes you an accomplice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added coldly, &#34;Better come clean when you get to the station. Being a co-conspirator&#39;s a big deal.&#34;</p>
