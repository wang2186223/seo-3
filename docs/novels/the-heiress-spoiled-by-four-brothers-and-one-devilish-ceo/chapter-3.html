                <p>Tristan&#39;s deep gaze locked onto her pale face, a sigh slipping out from his nose. &#34;I&#39;ll trust you... just this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked those innocent eyes at him, gently shaking the cuff still attached to the bedpost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp brows furrowed, clearly hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat of silence, he finally made up his mind,pressing both thumbs onto the fingerprint locks of her handcuffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft &#34;beep&#34; sounded, and the cuffs released with a clack, dropping onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now free, Megan rubbed her reddened wrists and stretched them a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered, &#34;Damn. Not even I could crack these-talk about next level. And last time. I&#39;m the one who tricked him into opening them.....Guess I&#39;ll have to ask him again. Ugh..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan suddenly smirked. &#34;Where&#39;d you get these cuffs? I swear, if I find out who made them, I&#39;m gonna make sure they never design anything again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cleared his throat lightly. &#34;Some tech guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yup,same answer, same tone. Lazy, as usual.  But whatever. Unlocked is good enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned in and gave his cool lips a quick peck.&#34;Thanks for believing me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kiss sent a shockwave straight through him,blood surging. His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first real kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming that time with the CPR didn&#39;t count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly looked awkward, ears turning a slight shade of red. &#34;Um...Oh, I&#39;ll ask Mrs. Jones to whip you up something. She&#39;ll bring it by later. I&#39;ve got a meeting at the office-I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned quickly and made for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he got to the door, his hand paused on the knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced back at her face-the one he loved most-then rushed out as if making a getaway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes misted up watching him go, his tall frame vanishing from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God really gave her a second shot at life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second chance to make things right with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze darkened, killing intent brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The debts of her past life-she was going to settle every last one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach sped down the road toward Reid Corp. In the driver&#39;s seat, Cameron Brooks adjusted his gold -rimmed glasses and happened to glance at the rearview mirror-only to get hit with a spook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The usually stone-faced boss was...smiling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was rarer than hitting the lottery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been Tristan&#39;s assistant for five whole years and never once seen this man crack a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the boss losing it, thanks to that drama queen back at the estate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cameron, focus on driving,&#34; came the flat voice from the back. &#34;You&#39;re not a reaction meme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron&#39;s lip twitched.Was he being that obvious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s little grin stayed plastered on his face all the way to the company entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once parked, Cameron hopped out and opened the door for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two stepped into the building and headed into the exclusive CEO elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the doors closed, a woman&#39;s designer clutch slipped in to block them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A curvy, seductive beauty stepped forward,her voice like warm honey. &#34;Mr. Reid, wait up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air dropped ten degrees instantly. Tristan&#39;s smile vanished like smoke, and his eyes shot daggers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was cold as ice, laced with anger. &#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly lacking the slightest self-preservation, the  woman slid one leg into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toss her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Cameron responded without missing a beat,now full-on bodyguard mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her without a hint of mercy and shoved her out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he calmly hit the close button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better disinfect the whole elevator.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, this kind of thing happened so often, he&#39;d lost track. Disinfecting the elevator had become part of the daily schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a mystery that Megan girl was. Wild as she was,she had the boss wrapped around her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this was the richest man in the empire we were talking about-he could have any woman he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nope. He had to fall for someone who didn&#39;t even like him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cameron was still busy trying to figure out that riddle, a cold voice pulled him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The 88th floor. Did you press it?&#34;Cameron cleared his throat awkwardly, hand clenched into a fist. &#34;Uh,sorry, sir. I&#39;ll handle it right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you show up at work with just your head next time,don&#39;t bother coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir!&#34;  A chill ran down Cameron&#39;s spine the moment he heard that. Sweat instantly broke out on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator doors slid open. Tristan Reid, sharply dressed in a tailored suit, strode straight toward the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the spacious room sat an oval redwood table, and every seat around it was already filled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tristan entered, everyone quickly stood and greeted,&#34;Good morning,Mr.Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight nod as the meeting began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly, Tristan barely paid attention the whole time. His mind was somewhere else-circling back to Megan&#39;s strange behavior earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she trying to get him to let his guard down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she planning to run again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really would do just about anything to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter where she went, he&#39;d find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she ran to the ends of the earth, he&#39;d drag her back himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made his dark eyes frost over. His jawline tensed, and both fists clenched on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went dead silent. No one dared utter a word,and the one speaking just now froze, lips trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly, Tristan stood up and, without a word,walked out of the meeting room with long, purposeful strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron scrambled to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood in front of the spotless mirror, staring at her own face still dripping from the cold wash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After days of not eating or drinking, her once-glowing complexion had faded into a sickly pallor. Hair messy,skin dull-she looked like a ghost straight out of a horror flick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had kissed Tristan like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually chuckled. Would he have nightmares tonight because of it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out of the bathroom and leaned against the wall,feeling drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept over the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft pink hues everywhere-her favorite color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Tristan had locked her up here, he had overhauled the entire room. It used to be all black and white, cold and modern-but now? Pink sheets, pink carpet, pink everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d even filled the place with stuffed toys-all pink too-like he was trying to fill the silence with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at all this, Megan couldn&#39;t deny it: Tristan really did spoil her in his own flawed way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Problem was, the man didn&#39;t know how to love.Well then, she&#39;d teach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knock, knock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; she said, barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones walked in, carrying a tray with croissants and cookies. The moment she saw Megan, her eyes widened in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the tray on the nightstand,she quickly turned back and helped Megan off the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Young Madam, please just make up with the young master. Look at you-you&#39;ve wasted away these last few days.&#34; Mrs. Jones gently helped her to the bed and pulled a thin blanket over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she handed Megan a cookie. &#34;You don&#39;t know this, but the young master stopped eating too. He&#39;s been working around the clock and hasn&#39;t taken a break. His stomach acted up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that&#39;s why he looked so pale lately-he&#39;d been punishing himself with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange ache settled in her chest, and even the butter cookie tasted a bit bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a breathy sigh. &#34;Mrs. Jones, I&#39;m done fighting with Tristan. I want to start over with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Megan&#39;s words, Mrs. Jones still looked  uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching her finish the whole croissant, she folded her hands, looking at her with sincere eyes.&#34;Miss, please...have some mercy on the young master.He really loves you, though maybe his way of showing it&#39;s a bit much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan reached out and held Mrs. Jones&#39; wrinkled,calloused hands, offering a soft smile. &#34;I mean it this time. I want to make things right with Tristan and take care of him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones&#39;s eyes turned red, her nose stinging a bit.&#34;Good... good. I&#39;ve watched him grow up. When he was little,he lived with his mom out in the coutryside.Didn&#39;t come back to the Reid family until he was eight.Poor child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had only seen the polished, public side of Tristan. She had no clue about the truth behind his background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Mrs. Jones with a hint of confusion in her eyes. &#34;Wait, I&#39;m not following-Mrs. Jones,isn&#39;t his mom Mrs. Reid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Jones shook her head, just about to explain when they both heard a sharp knock at the door.</p>
