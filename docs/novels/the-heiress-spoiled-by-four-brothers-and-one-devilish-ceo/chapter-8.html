                <p>Megan was kissed dizzy, her head spinning, and before she knew it, her arms were wrapped around his neck like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,their lips parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan jerked back,taking a deep breath. &#34;You should get some sleep. I&#39;m gonna crash in the room next door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, he bolted out like someone lit a fire under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sat up, staring at his slightly panicked retreating figure, the corner of her mouth twitching in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? She had finally made up her mind to move things forward, and he ran away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her chin with suspicion. Was something wrong with her charm level?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing down at her figure under the thin nightgown -curves in all the right places, nothing lacking there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what gives?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless. he&#39;s the one with issues?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the man she suspected of being&#34;not okay&#34;had made it back to his room and headed straight to the shower for some cold water therapy. Tristan tried to cool down the fire churning in his chest. He was seriously scared he might freak her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had just agreed to be with him. She was still new to this. He didn&#39;t want to mess it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing only a bathrobe, he strolled out of the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bed, legs apart and arms restng on his knees, his thoughts full of that sweet little woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled to himself like an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he turned his head toward the wall,gently pressing his palm against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she doing now in the next room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to sneak a peek tugged at him, but he knew if he went over... there&#39;d be no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he managed to calm himself, he finally lay back in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time ever, the night felt endlessly long.He tossed and turned like a pancake on a griddle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then an idea struck him. He got up,walked over to the desk, and pulled out a black phone from the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his fingers over the screen again and again,then left the room and headed toward the easternmost corner of the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This room looked like all the others, same decor and setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to the nightstand and pressed a hidden button behind it. The floor shifted, and a hidden staircase was revealed leading to a secret underground passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He descended, the motion sensor lights snapping on one by one. The entry closed behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until dawn broke did he finally return to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in his dream, he was desperately searching for Megan,but no matter how far he looked, he couldn&#39;t find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes snapped open. He jumped out of bed barefoot and dashed straight to her room next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, he turned the handle and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart clenched in that instant-she really left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So all that sweetness yesterday had just been an act?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white,jaw set hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swore, wherever she went, he&#39;d bring her back-and never let her go again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan! Tristan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait...was he hearing things now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at the large window. The voice sounded like it was coming from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed over and saw her through the glass, in a sporty outfit, waving up at him while calling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting him there, Megan beamed and shouted,&#34;I&#39;m out for a run! Come join me!&#34; The second Tristan saw her, all the anger and tension he&#39;d been holding onto just.vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she didn&#39;t run away after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly raised a hand, the corners of his lips lifting into a subtle smile as he shot her a little &#34;OK&#34; gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, he hustled back to his bedroom,threw on a workout outfit, and darted downstairs to find Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning sunlight cut through the leftover mist,casting a warm golden glow on everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit Megan&#39;s porcelain skin just right-she looked almost surreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spotted him striding out of the villa,her face instantly lit up. She bounced over and threw herself into his arms. &#34;Morning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden move made him chuckle. He reached up and gently ruffled her hair. &#34;Morning. Sleep well last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her eyes, noticing the slight dark circles under his. &#34;Not really. You weren&#39;t there with me.How am I supposed to sleep without you? Looks like you didn&#39;t sleep great either, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cleared his throat and said, &#34;Oh, I stayed up working on the South Eden Resort project in the study Construction&#39;s about to start.&#34;  Her lips twitched-it was a weak excuse, and she wasn&#39;t buying it. Teasingly, she tugged on his arm.&#34;Then how about sleeping with me from now on?Sound good? Come on, say yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That soft, whiny tone of hers? Yeah, it totally/melted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed lightly and said, &#34;Deal. I&#39;ll eat with you,drink with you, and sleep with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan burst out laughing. &#34;Wow, sounds like the &#39;full -service&#39; pack&lt;age!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s grin froze for a second. &#34;Megan, that little mouth of yours is too dangerous sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped her face, brushing a kiss across her slightly flushed lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shimmered like water, leaving him wishing he could freeze time right at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took off jogging around the man-made lake inside the estate. Two white swans were swimming close, their necks twining playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light breeze drifted by, sending ripples across the surface of the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their run, they went back to their rooms to shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock,knock,knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan opened the door, Tristan stood there in a sleek slate-grey suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took one look at her in that white lace doll dress-  LX&#39;s latest bag swinging from her hand-and was completely floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No makeup, but her features were stunning. Long lashes framed her clever fox-like eyes, lips red and teeth white. that smile could ruin a guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, he kinda wanted to lock her up so no one else could so much as glance at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed over a black cellphone, and her eyes lit up instantly.	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been taken away ever since he&#39;d locked her up -she hadn&#39;t expected to see it again so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the surprise and excitement on her face,guilt pricked him a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the next second, he said, &#34;I wiped all the other guys&#39; numbers. Only mine&#39;s left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flung herself into his arms. &#34;That&#39;s fine.Whether it&#39;s my contacts or my whole life. you&#39;re the only one I really need.&#34;Tristan felt like his heart had been dipped in honey hearing that. He gave her back a gentle pat. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s grab some breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the stairs, two rows of maids-all dressed neatly and clearly over fifty-were already lined up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Ford bowed slightly. &#34;Good morning, young master. Good morning,young madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the staff immediately followed in chorus,&#34;Good morning,young master. Good morning,young madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing a step above the others, Tristan turned his head toward Megan&#39;s delicate side profile,voice soft and teasing, &#34;Your turn to talk, madam boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled, shot him a glance, then turned to face the crowd. &#34;Alright everyone, at ease. Here at Dreamscape Manor, there are thirty million rules you need to follow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of the maids&#39; mouths twitched wildly.Yep,this drama queen was definitely up to no good. This was pure payback for snubbing her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Ford also took a deep breath. Her behavior now confirmed his suspicions from last night. She&#39;s changed tactics-not only trying to charm the young master but also aiming to put the staff in their place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty million rules? That would take a lifetime just to list! And even if she managed it, who on earth could remember them all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at the wide-eyed staff, Megan lifted her proud,swan-like neck. &#34;Well? Any objections?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Ford gave a slight nod. &#34;Please, Young Madam.We&#39;re listening.&#34; He&#39;d already pulled out a pen and paper from his trouser pocket, ready to jot down whatever he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing tall and graceful, Megan surveyed them all like a queen. Her voice was cool and crisp,ringing with authority. &#34;Remember this: Three rules only. Never gossip. Never play dirty tricks. And always obey your  masters. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff stared in momentary confusion, then chorused in unison: &#34;Understood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan casually slung an arm around Megan&#39;s waist and led her into the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady fingers, he picked up two slices of bread,layered on the grilled beef,lettuce,tomato slices,and salad dressing, stacking it into a sandwich before handing it over to Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Megan passed him a chicken sandwich she&#39;d made for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Mrs. Jones, pouring warm milk for them, couldn&#39;t help smiling like a proud aunt. Her grin was practically jetting into orbit. Watching the two of them, it was like they were an old married couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a strong feeling she&#39;d be juggling baby bottles and diapers soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterthey each finished their sandwiches and downed their milk, Tristan noticed a little smudge of milk on the corner of Megan&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft laugh, he leaned in and kissed her, his tongue lightly sweeping across the spot. &#34;Tastes sweet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan covered her mouth, giggling, &#34;You too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them strolled outside, stopping in front of the garage-a four-story building with fifty luxury cars parked on every level.&#34;What kind of ride do you like best? Sedan, sports car,or SUV?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rubbed her chin, poretending to think hard.&#34;Sports car. They run fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes darkened ever so slightly. He pinched her chin gently, dipped low and gave her lower lip a playful bite. &#34;Still thinking about running?&#34;</p>
