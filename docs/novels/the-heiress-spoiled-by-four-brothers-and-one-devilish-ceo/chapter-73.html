                <p>The hallway was packed, and all eyes were on Natalie&#39;s mom losing her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter clearly tried to hurt someone, ended up hurting herself, and yet here she was, making a scene instead of reflecting on her parenting.If anything,her outburst only proved the saying: like mother, like daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy,already humiliated, was now seething with rage.With shaky hands, she pulled out a glass bottle filled with concentrated sulfuric acid from her bag, twisted the cap off, and hurled it forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that split second, a tiny silhouette shot out from the side pouch of Megan&#39;s backpack like a bullet-it was Nova Tech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little robot darted towards the bottle, pushing it mid-air, flipping the liquid&#39;s path. Instead of hitting Megan and Rachel Reid, the acid splashed straight back at Nancy herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blood-curdling scream pierced the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bottle shattered into shards on the floor, fumes rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned and saw Nancy&#39;s hair smoking, hands trembling as she tried to shield her face, only to realize she didn&#39;t dare touch herself. Her face was already beyond recognition-skin blackened, one eye melted, grotesque and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around either shrieked and bolted or whipped out their phones to record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech zipped back onto Megan&#39;s shoulder, voice steady and heroic, the usual sweet tone gone. &#34;Nova&#39;s brave! Protecting my princess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at Nancy, whose twisted face reflected her own twisted heart. The warmth in her eyes was instantly replaced by coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, a mom loving her daughter was natural. But blindly defending her when both mom and daughter had crossed the line? That wasn&#39;t love-it was madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nova hadn&#39;t jumped in just now, she and Rachel would&#39;ve been the ones disfigured today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the whir of sirens filled the air. Paramedics and police arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy was rushed to the hospital while Megan and Rachel were taken to the station for questioning.Police also randomly picked witnesses among the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan was still in a meeting when Ryan, the head of Criminal Investigations, called with the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he heard someone had thrown acid, he dropped everything and rushed to the station. As Megan stepped out of the interview room, she was instantly pulled into a familiar, firm embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you call me?&#34; Tristan&#39;s voice was low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Megan tilted her head to answer, he pressed it back to his chest. &#34;Do you think I&#39;m just furniture to be ignored?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced sideways at Rachel, who raised both hands in mock innocence. &#34;Don&#39;t look at me! I didn&#39;t say anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,clearly Ryan spilled the beans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn that tattletale!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms tight around Tristan&#39;s waist and murmured, &#34;I&#39;m fine, really. Didn&#39;t want to interrupt your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned closer and bit gently on her earlobe.&#34;So,I was too gentle last night,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That slight huskiness in his voice almost made her knees give out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about how they&#39;d gotten heated last night but stopped right at the edge made even her ears blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached back and pinched his muscled back-but ugh,he was way too solid to even squish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel,watching this public display of affection from the sidelines, cleared her throat. &#34;You two are shameless.Animal abuse, I&#39;m reporting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked, cheek resting against Tristan&#39;s chest. Don&#39;t act like you&#39;re all alone. Your man&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel turned to see Kai standing there, cool and aloof like always. She immediately dashed toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled just a little-barely noticeable-as he said in his calm voice, &#34;Come on. I&#39;ll take you home.&#34;Watching Rachel hop along after Kai like an excited bunny, Tristan said, &#34;When Rachel was six, she went on a road trip with her parents. But their car was hit head -on by a truck. The driver? Drunk. Had 90mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Her parents died instantly.Somehow,Rachel survived. Her aunt later adopted her from an orphanage and renamed her Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan felt a wave of compassion wash over her.&#34;She&#39;s had it rough, but also kind of lucky in her own way. Really hope she and Kai work out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently patted her back, his voice soft. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,they will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping Megan off at Dreamscape Manor,Tristan had lunch with his grandfather and then headed back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only two days leftto submit her designs, Megan planted herself at her desk all afternoon. She created six dress styles and one pendant- seven sketches in total. After scanning them, she attached the files in an email with a note: [These are the new LX pieces. All materials are marked out. Finish in 3 days. There&#39;s a fashion and jewelry design competition this Saturday - come to Verduria.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came instantly: [At your service, my Queen LiMo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan selected three dress sketches and the pendant rendering, slipped them into a kraft paper envelope for submission. The first round required initial designs;only those selected got to compete in the finals. But with her skills? She was already prepping for the finals ahead of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back, stretching with a small smug smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as her back touched the chair, she jumped up in surprise. Eyes wide, she blinked at the unexpected presence. &#34;Weren&#39;t you playing chess with Grandpa? When did you sneak in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime gave a creepy little chuckle. &#34;Zeta&#39;s just too clever. Grandpa bailed on the game. I went silent mode. You were so dialed into your work, you didn&#39;t even notice me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan suddenly remembered sending that email earlier. &#34;You saw my screen, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta waved its robotic arms frantically, &#34;Nope, nope!Zeta didn&#39;t see anything! Promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you kidding me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan narrowed her eyes, knowing Zeta&#39;s loose lips could blurt outanything at any time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She circled the bot, arms crossed. &#34;Zeta, do you know what happens to traitors around here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta nodded with dramatic seriousness. &#34;They get dismantled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta&#39;s survival instincts kicked in: &#34;C&#39;mon, just let me off easy, okay? I&#39;m blind as a bat, didn&#39;t see a thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled inwardly. This annoying hunk of metal was way too clever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to tell Zeta to scram, Nova Tech popped out of a side pouch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova&#39;s scan indicates Zeta&#39;s filled with mutiny. Based on data analysis, there&#39;s a high risk this guy&#39;s gonna snitch! Best course of action: dismantle immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta&#39;s round head spun with a click, red lights glowing in its eyes. &#34;Nova&#39;s just jealous! Jealous of Zeta&#39;s genius and cuteness! Zeta will dismantle you first,you drama queen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, in the soft, pastel-colored room.the robot war was on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at the two clunky tin cans threatening each other and let out a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; she yelled.</p>
