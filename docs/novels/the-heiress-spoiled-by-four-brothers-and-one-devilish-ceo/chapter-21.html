                <p>He looked down at the sweet little woman clinging to his neck,obedient and soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That coy expression of hers was seriously messing with his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, gently kissing her flushed lips, lingering a bit longer than necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knock knock knock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The untimely knock on the door immediately killed the mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a low sigh and buried his face into the crook of her neck, breathing in the light floral scent clinging to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire still lingered in his eyes as he walked to open the door with a darkened expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold air from the opened door made Lina and Rachel,who stood outside,shiver a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel raised the deck of cards in her hand.&#34;Hehe,we wanna play cards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan shot them a rather annoyed glare before striding out of the room.  The two sisters grinned and closed the door behind them, happily rushing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was standing by the tall window, gazing out at the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They instinctively glanced at the bed-neatly made,not a wrinkle in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina breathed a quiet sigh of relief and raised her brows at Rachel, as if saying: nice,we didn&#39;t ruin their alone time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan walked up and grabbed their hands. &#34;Come sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s eyes casually roamed over Megan-until they landed on her neck. The smile on her face froze mid -curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up. is that a hickey?&#34; she gasped, practically choking on her own words. &#34;Right there on your neck -girl,my brain just short-circuited!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina followed her gaze and let out a soft groan. &#34;Oh no. Rae,your Meridian University is in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan instantly realized what they were staring at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That devil Tristan had definitely done it on purpose-like leaving a signature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suppressed the urge to groan, quickly reaching up to brush her hair over the mark, fingers grazing the sore spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep. That was gonna bruise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to play it off, she gave an awkward laugh. &#34;Oh -uh,I burned myself with the curling iron this morning.  Total fail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel raised an eyebrow. &#34;On your neck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan doubled down. &#34;I was in a hurry. Wrong angle.It happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina and Rachel both gave her looks like yeah-right Who would buy that excuse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you wanna play cards?&#34; Megan asked, breaking the awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel patted her chest proudly. &#34;I&#39;m actually really good at cards! Lina taught me Uno once, and boom-l became a legend. Come on, Megan, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t bluffing-Rachel was ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed down a Draw Four, followed by a Skip,then flashed her last card with a smug grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uno,baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked. &#34;Did she just reverse, skip, and nuke me in one turn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina shrugged, trying not to laugh. &#34;We usually bet cocktails. Rae&#39;s luck is ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation? If Lina didn&#39;t cheat once in a while,Rachel would have a personal bartender by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave Lina an amused side-eye. &#34;Didn&#39;t peg you for the sneaky type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;Rae, promise me you won&#39;t play like this at school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;  Megan leaned in, all sincere and big-sisterly. &#34;Think about it. You&#39;re lucky and good at the game-if you win too much, no one&#39;s gonna want to play with you anymore.&#34; Basically, keep it up and people will think you&#39;re clueless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel flashed a sweet grin. &#34;Got it, Megan.&#34;&#34;Just thinking about going to school with you tomorrow has me all excited,&#34; Rachel said with a grin. &#34;Hey,how about me and Mom just move into Dreamscape?Makes things easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina cleared her throat. &#34;Rachel, come on-they just got married. Don&#39;t go playing the third wheel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s gaze shifted awkwardly to the faint mark on Megan&#39;s neck, then she chuckled. &#34;Fair point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled softly. &#34;It&#39;s really fine, if you two want to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stood there, expression unreadable. His voice was calm but firm. &#34;&#39;I&#39;ve got a villa in Emerald Cove near the university. You and Auntie can stay there.I&#39;ll have someone prepare it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three of themn turned to stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been eavesdropping outside? That timing was just way too on-point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan glanced at his diamond-studded Rolex. &#34;It&#39;s almost six. Let&#39;s head out. Kevin and Kai should be there already.&#34; Hearing Kai&#39;s name, Rachel shot up. &#34;I&#39;m coming too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for permission, she bolted out the door and practically flew downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina, looking mildly stressed, murmured, &#34;L...uh, still got homework. You two have fun.&#34; Then she quickly made her exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, she turned back with a grin. &#34;Best wishes on your marriage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled Megan close by the waist, fingers gently brushing the faint hickey on her neck. &#34;Huh. I thought I only kissed it once. Why&#39;s it darker now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave his chest a light punch. &#34;Ugh, you troublemaker! Now they&#39;re gonna get the wrong idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s laugh rumbled low and smooth.&#34;Oh come on -trouble looks good on you. Can&#39;t get enough of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a mock glare, cheeks burning. &#34;How are you still laughing? I&#39;m dying of secondhand embarrassment! You totally did that on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,now they&#39;ll think twice before barging in.Maybe next time they&#39;ll remember what we might be &#39;busy&#39;doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan felt her face practically boiling. &#34;Let&#39;s just go.Rachel&#39;s already downstairs waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled lowly. &#34;Someone&#39;s about to get a big headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked up at him.&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in and landed a quick, firm kiss on her lips. &#34;Kai.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying a quick goodbye to Mr. Reid, the two headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Nathan and Sophia were getting out of their car nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan approached. &#34;Heading out now, Tristan?Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded coolly. &#34;Yeah, got something to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan smiled kindly at Megan. &#34;Megan, make sure you two visit more often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan returned the smile softly. &#34;Of couse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan kept her hand firmly in his as they walked toward the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel waved from the sidewalk. &#34;Hi, Uncle! Auntie !&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car unlocked, she darted into the backseat like she was afraid they&#39;d ditch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan walked around and opened the passenger side door, being the gentleman as usual for Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the backseat came Rachel&#39;s voice in a whiny tone. &#34;Megan, sit in the back with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a quiet scoff. &#34;Nope. She&#39;s with me.&#34;Tristan gently eased the little woman into the passenger seat and buckled her in like it was second nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he casually strolled around to the driver&#39;s side  and hopped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smooth turn of the wheel, the car sped off,vanishing around the corner, leaving behind nothing but a faint whiff of exhaust and frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stomped her foot angrily. &#34;Honey, did you see that? They don&#39;t even look at us like we exist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan threw her a sideways glance, voice cold.&#34;Pretty sure you meant they don&#39;t respect you. Don&#39;t drag me into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying that, he turned and walked off toward the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his back without a hint of warmth, Sophia&#39;s teeth clenched so tightly they almost cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t been for the drug she slipped him after they got married, he wouldn&#39;t have even touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that one night messed everything up-Wyatt happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought giving Nathan a son would at least make him change a bit, soften him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no, he was like a damned freezer. Cold as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Same went for Wyatt-never got a second of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like a widow who never even got a wedding night out of her deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder: what was the point of all that scheming, threatening her life just to land this lousy marriage?  She hated how he acted like she was invisible-and hated that woman, Hanjie, even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about how fast that woman died made her bitter-if she could do it over, she would&#39;ve dragged it out longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia caught up to Nathan and grabbed his arm. &#34;Did you not see the brooch on her dress?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s expression darkened. He yanked his arm back.&#34;So what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned. &#34;That&#39;s the matriarch&#39;s brooch! lt means your father passed the position of head to Tristan! It should&#39;ve gone to you-or at least to Wyatt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan let out a short laugh. &#34;Since Tristan took over,the company&#39;s profits have tripled here and overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reid Corp is now the biggest powerhouse in the country. All of that-his doing. He earned the title.You need to stop your delusional daydreaming. You&#39;re just a parasite-stick to that and quit stirring up trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his silhouette faded into the house, her fists clenched so hard her nails dug into her palms without her even noticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Evelyn hurried over, brows furrowed with concern. &#34;Sophia, how&#39;s Wyatt doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia let out a heavy sigh. &#34;Soft tissue damage,ruptured spleen, fractured shoulder blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan really wasn&#39;t pulling punches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s nostrils flared as she exhaled hard. &#34;You&#39;ve no idea, they actually gave the family heir title to that illegitimate son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing it out loud again made Sophia grit her teeth like she was going to bite something in half. &#34;That brooch&#39;s already on that little tramp&#39;s dress. Like hell I didn&#39;t see it coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn looked like she&#39;d just seen a bird crash into a window. &#34;I tried speaking up for Wyatt to the old man,but he just snapped at me in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sneered, voice laced with venom. &#34;I sent that bitch to her grave once-l can do it again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn glanced around quickly, clearly spooked.&#34;For the love of God, keep your voice down. That woman died of cancer, remember? We had nothing to do with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stared blankly into the distance, her gaze hollow but burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her heart, she swore-whoever dared stand in her way,or her son&#39;s path, would not make it out unscathed.</p>
