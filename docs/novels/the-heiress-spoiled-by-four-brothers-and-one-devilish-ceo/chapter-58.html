                <p>Since Tristan came back late and skipped dinner,Megan decided to cook for him herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as the petite woman focused on slicing vegetables and finely shredding meat. The sight alone filled Tristan&#39;s heart with a quiet contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan placed a soft, half-cooked egg on top,their sizzling stone pot bibimbap was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he wolfed it down, Megan chuckled,&#34;Tasty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delicious. Smells amazing-just like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, grinning. &#34;You&#39;re such a flirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flirting, sure. But &#39;old&#39;? I object.&#34; Tristan casually wiped his mouth then held her hand and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut behind her heels, and the next moment she was in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing where this was heading,she looked up and puckered her blushing lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, he just kissed her lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked in surprise. &#34;What? That&#39;s it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised a brow. &#34;Why? Expecting more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned crimson. &#34;N-No! What are you  saying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He absolutely adored her fiery yet bashful reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her to the vanity and sat her down.&#34;Here,let me show you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Digging into his pants pocket, he pulled out a monitor no bigger than a pea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up. &#34;Wait-is this a surveillance cam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup. Latest model. We talked about putting one in the old house, right? Got a plan for that yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan arched her brow slyly. &#34;Of course. Just follow my lead tomorrow, and we&#39;re good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that mischievous smile, Tristan had a bad feeling in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough,by dawn the next morning, all hell had broken loose at the Reid estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rancid stench flooded the whole mansion, forcing everyone outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey wrapped his coat tighter,frowning.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Stewart quickly explained, &#34;Already contacted the pipe company-it&#39;s likely a sewage backup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the barely-awake Megan in his arms, Tristan said, &#34;We&#39;re heading back to Dreamscape Manor.The rest of you should go to the Empire Hotel. Once this is sorted, we&#39;ll return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shot Megan a death glare-clearly blaming her  for the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, everyone left for the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the drive, Tristan and Megan doubled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;d you even pull this off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a proud chuckle. &#34;Tweaked the valves via remote control. Once the electronic regulators in the pipes were reversed, the waste couldn&#39;t get out,so of course it backed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at her, smiling fondly. &#34;You are such a little genius.&#34;The two returned to the mansion and set up all the surveillance equipment in spots where issues might crop up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the crew from the plumbing company arrived,Megan reset the flow control system back to normal,leaving no trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when the workers inspected everything, they couldn&#39;t find any signs of tampering-just figured some blockage had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After using specialized equipment to freshen the air,things were back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had Cameron bring the chef back in to treat themselves to a cozy candlelit lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting into her steak, Megan glanced up and asked,&#34;Why does your dad still stay at the old house while Harrison and Julian moved out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan sipped his glass ofrich red wine and grinned &#34;Because my grandma had a thing for baby boys-just not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian has a daughter, and Harrison has no kids at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when she was alive, she let my dad and Sophia stay at the old place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan knew full well why his grandma didn&#39;t like him -that all traced back to his mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her chin thoughtfully, &#34;If your grandma hadn&#39;t been cremated, you think I could&#39;ve annoyed her back to life?&#34;八、</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan burst into rare laughter, &#34;Totally possible.You&#39;d even be able to whip out the family rules on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the person had passed, they didn&#39;t push the joke any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the next evening was Mr. Reid&#39;s birthday banquet at the Imperial Hotel, the family didn&#39;t return to the old mansion that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan finally had some quiet time to themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right at 6 p.m. the next day,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luxury cars began pulling up one after another at the doors of the Imperial Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Political big shots and the four great families in Verduria-The Reids, The Lewises, The Channings, and The Bennettes-along with social elites from every corner,all gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came bearing extravagant gifts, not just to wish the old man a happy birthday, but more importantly,to show they were eager to work with the Reids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Verduria, if you managed to land a deal with the Reids-even for just five percent-that was more than enough to make a killing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach stopped at the hotel entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped out and helped Megan out, casually slipping his arm around her waist as they headed inside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand ballroom glowed under dazzling crystal chandeliers. Powerful guests toasted each other,socialites chatted and laughed like old friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the entrance buzzed with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan walked in, clad in an elegant dark suit,long legs striding effortlessly, holding his wife close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were cool and distant, giving off an untouchable vibe, the kind of aura that silently told everyone who was boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the woman in his arms, many of the rich young ladies couldn&#39;t hide the envy in their eyes-she was too stunning to be real.The sleek black gown hugged her curves just right, subtly showing off her graceful collarbones under the off-shoulder cut. Her skin looked even more radiant and smooth against the dark fabric, practically glowing under the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had a faint smile on her rose-tinted lips,looking like an angel who&#39;d wandered into the human world.She casually brushed back her long, wavy black hair-there was something effortlessly captivating about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Mr. Reid&#39;s fiancée?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, you mean Mrs. Reid now. I heard they already got the marriage certificate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, my dream guy&#39;s married?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t hear? He spent a fortune the other night just to make her smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, Mr. Reid is seriously whipped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she the one who ran away before the wedding?Megan,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, and he still dotes on her like crazy. even after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh! Don&#39;t talk about that in public!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan muttered under her breath with a smirk,just loud enough for only Tristan to hear, &#34;Still plenty of girls here who just won&#39;t give up hope, huh?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan cleared his throat lightly. &#34;If any of them try to swoop in, I&#39;ll turn &#39;em into roast sparrows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Elliot, Diane, and Chloe across the room,Megan couldn&#39;t hide the grin forming in her eyes.She waved toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next moment, her smile froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin appeared, wine glass in hand, stepping in front of them and casually chatting like they were best  buddies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow-when did this guy get into their inner circle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guess pestering persistently and shamelessly does work for old guys like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With curious eyes following them, Megan and Tristan moved toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid and Bruce sat in the front near the stage,while everyone else mingled with guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan stepped forward and bowed deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan smiled politely. &#34;Wishing Grandpa lasting health and a long, prosperous life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan added with a gentle grin, &#34;May today&#39;s joy stay with you all year-and come back again every year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gestured behind him, and Cameron stepped forward with a long box held in both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening it revealed a pair of custom ebony canes with gold inlays and engraved lion heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid was clearly pleased. Though, having two of these was a bit much-was he expected to walk with both?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at Bruce and cleared her throat softly.&#34;Well, I did notice Uncle Stewart&#39;s cane has been looking kinda old lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce chuckled, remembering when Megan had borrowed his cane to chase off that overly flashy assistant. &#34;Especially since it got used to clobber a  moron the other day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reid had also heard the story, and now it all made sense to him. He clicked his tongue and nodded approvingly.&#34;Ah,hitting two targetswithone shot,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan beamed. &#34;Not at all. We like to say. double the blessings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Molly entered the hall in a strapless,floor-length white gown, pushing Wyattina wheelchair, his suit crisp and sharp.</p>
