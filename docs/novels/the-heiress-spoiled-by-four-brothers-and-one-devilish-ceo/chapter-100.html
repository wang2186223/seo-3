                <p>Tristan totally got what Megan meant. Since she offered him a way out, he took it without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called Linus Blake, told him to drop the lawsuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he asked Cameron to get in touch with the top psychiatric hospital in the Capital and arrange for their most trusted expert to do a mental assessment for Natalie Banks-on behalf of the Lewis family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small move was a huge favor to the Lewis family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, it sent a clear message: she might&#39;ve dodged jail, but there was no way Tristan was letting her off lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his bottom line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the big shots leave, Ryan let out a silent sigh.He figured Natalie would&#39;ve been better off in prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least serving time had an end date. But once you&#39;re in a psychiatric hospital? That&#39;s a whole new level of misery. Even if she got out someday, her reputation would already be in the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Capitol City Airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two figures emerged from the VIP security exit.  The man wore a sharp suit, with a tall, imposing figure.His features were striking-deep-set eyes, straight nose, no real emotion on his face, but he gave off that classic mature-man charisma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm was around a petite, stunning socialite. Her fox-like eyes sparkled with calm intensity, like still autumn water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, Jason, and Samuel stepped up and respectfully greeted, &#34;Dad, Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zachary Lewis gave a short nod. &#34;Mm. Your mom&#39;s a bit motion-sick. We&#39;ll head straight home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey,&#34; Stella rubbed her temple, looking exhausted,&#34;I&#39;m planning to bail out my distant cousin&#39;s daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She stabbed Jason. Forget letting her off, and now you want to go pick her up yourself? You&#39;re not in shape for that. Go home and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zachary&#39;s tone made it clear. Stella didn&#39;t reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her last name isn&#39;t Banks, she wouldn&#39;t have bothered in the first place. Especially when her own son was the one who got stabbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally nodded. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll listen to you. Let Oliver handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver responded with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Amelia? Why isn&#39;t she here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel let out a laugh. &#34;After all the embarrassment she brought to the family, you think she deserves to show up?” Stella sighed. &#34;She might not be your real sister, but she&#39;s called you &#39;brother&#39; all these years. Cut her some slack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Jason. &#34;No work today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason chuckled a little. &#34;Nothing&#39;s more important than welcoming you guys home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella smiled at him, her gentle warmth obvious. &#34;My second son always knows just what to say. Samuel,you should learn a thing or two from your brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light smile, Zachary wrapped an arm around her slender waist and started walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel pouted. &#34;Am I really that out of favor with Mom and Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver shot him a look but said nothing, following behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave him a friendly pat. &#34;Don&#39;t sell yourself short, man.&#34;Samuel was a little moved. &#34;Jason, you&#39;re really the only one who-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even get to finish when Jason let out a laugh.&#34;You? No one in the family likes you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was speechless. &#34;Seriously? That&#39;s what you go with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the airport entrance, Oliver watched the family van drive off, then headed straight to the detention center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he got there, Ryan was leaning on the back of a police car, smoking. Two cigarette butts lay on the  ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Oliver approach, Ryan stubbed out his cigarette and came over. &#34;Mr. Lewis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver nodded slightly. &#34;Thanks for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan made a call, and the gate buzzed open. Soon,Natalie was led out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw Oliver, her eyes flickered with disbelief. She knew his mother, Stella, was distantly related to her father, Richard-but they were barely even family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always tried to cozy up to Amelia, hoping to get closer to the Lewis family, but Amelia kept brushing her off, never letting her get too near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that something had finally happened, she didn&#39;t expect the Lewis family would actually step in to bail her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nervous. After all, she did stab Jason. But this move. could it mean Stella still cared about blood ties?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up with hope. Maybe this was her way back in-maybe she could even use the Lewises to take down Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ryan&#39;s next words crushed every bit of that fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lewis, Mr. Reid said since Natalie needs a psychiatric evaluation, the Reid family will help too.He&#39;s arranged the top specialist at the Third Psychiatric Hospital to examine her.&#34; When she heard it was Tristan who&#39;d arranged the doctors, Natalie instantly panicked. She&#39;d escaped one trap only to fall into another-worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going! I&#39;m not going! Once I go in, I&#39;m never getting out!&#34; she screamed, her voice rising in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan looked at her calmly. &#34;Then it&#39;s simple. Either you go in for treatment, or you go to prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words-pretend to be mentally ill or get locked up for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie snapped. &#34;It&#39;s all that bitch Megan&#39;s fault! If it weren&#39;t for her, none of this would&#39;ve happened! My mom wouldn&#39;t be disfigured, my dad wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the hospital, and the Banks family wouldn&#39;t be in ruins. She ruined everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it bother him so much to hear her dragging Megan&#39;s name through the mud?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice turned cold. &#34;Captain Mitchell,please take her to the hospital. Just keep me posted on the results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him get into the car, Natalie completely lost it.Her eyes widened with tears flooding out. &#34;Oliver! You can&#39;t just leave me! Your mom is my aunt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver rolled the window down and gave her a chilly glance. &#34;Exactly. And that very distant blood tie is the only reason we bailed you out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you don&#39;t want the psych evaluation, that&#39;s fine-go  sit in jail. Up to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But don&#39;t expect us to ruin our relationship with the Reid family over you.&#34;Yeah, those words were tough,but they weren&#39;t wronng.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had sinister intentions-trying to ruin someone&#39;s reputation and even going as far as wielding a knife. Just plain brutal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her mother? She didn&#39;t hesitate to go after someone&#39;s looks. In the end, they just got what was coming to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hard to feel sorry for either of them now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver rolled up the window and shifted his gaze.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at the black Rolls-Royce as it disappeared down the road, bawling uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s tone was sharp: &#34;So, prison or a psych eval?You decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After crying herself hoarse, she finally whimpered,&#34;Hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured prison meant no way out, but maybe the psych ward would give her a shot to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan waved his hand, and two officers moved to escort her into the police car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the front seat, Ryan told the officer next to him, &#34;Third Psychiatric Hospital.&#34;  Thirty minutes later, the car pulled up outside the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron was already waiting at the entrance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief talk with Cameron, the officers brought Natalie inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital&#39;s top specialist ran a full evaluation and concluded she was suffering from severe dissociative identity disorder and manic episodes-needed inpatient care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Natalie heard the diagnosis, she scratched the expert across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took four orderlies to hold her still while they gave her a sedative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expert, pressing a hand over the scratch marks,gave Cameron a wry smile. &#34;We&#39;ve seen cases like hers before. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll make sure she doesn&#39;t become a danger to others again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan stayed quiet. After all, this was the path Natalie had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do enough bad, and it&#39;ll come back to bite you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron gave a nod. &#34;Thanks, Dr. Neagle. I&#39;ll leave her in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Lewis family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their car pulled up at the entrance, and Zachary helped Stella down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia spotted them and hurried over with a bright smile. &#34;Dad, Mom, you&#39;re finally back! I missed you so  much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looped her arm through Stella&#39;s affectionately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel let out a cold snicker. &#34;What, think your backup&#39;s back so you can go back to playing your little games?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia blinked, teary-eyed. &#34;No wonder you never like me. I really don&#39;t know what I keep doing wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella patted her hand. &#34;Your brother&#39;s never been the type to spoil girls. Don&#39;t let it get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the three of them head inside, Samuel turned to Jason. &#34;Did you see that? Classic fake sweetheart act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot him a sideways glance. &#34;Wanna know why you keep falling for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Samuel genuinely wanted to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason chuckled. &#34;Because you run your mouth too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel:[You sure you&#39;re really my brother? Ugh seriously. Not even human.]</p>
