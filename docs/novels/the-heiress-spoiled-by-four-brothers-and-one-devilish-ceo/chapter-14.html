                <p>That night, Tristan didn&#39;t get back to Dreamscape Manor until late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was already fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He changed into pajamas, gently lifted the blanket and slid into bed, carefully pulling her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even that small movement woke her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her eyes, her voice soft and sleepy.&#34;You&#39;re back? Did you eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, grabbed something. I also got in touch with Brandon Lewis.He&#39;ll be back mid-September to check on Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flew open,joy lighting up her face.&#34;Really?That&#39;s amazing! Grandpa might get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and snuggled closer. &#34;You&#39;re the best, babe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan tilted her chin up, eyes glinting. &#34;Darling,Capitol City requires a 3-day cooling-off period after license application.&#34; His thumb brushed her lower lip.&#34;By the time the bureaucrats stamp approval...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed. &#34;So we wait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Justice doesn&#39;t wait.&#34; His phone lit up with a federal judge&#39;s contact. &#34;Judge Callahan owes me for saving his election. One emergency motion later...&#34; He swiped open a court order PDF stamped EX PARTE WAIVER. &#34;...Capitol Family Code §420 waived. Our license gets printed tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan squinted at the judicial seal. &#34;You had a federal judge kill a state waiting period?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling,&#34; he captured her hand, pressing it over his heart, &#34;I&#39;d have him overturn gravity if you asked. Now -Say &#39;l do&#39;, Babe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| do,I do...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan rolled over and pinned her beneath him,staring into her eyes. &#34;I am the happiest man in the world. Let me give my wife a proper kiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he dragged himself away from Megan&#39;s bedroom with leaden limbs, teeth gnashing against the ache in his gut. After locking the door behind him with a rattling hand, he turned the shower knob to its coldest setting-the icy cascade a necessary antidote to the fever that had left him trembling between duty and desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next mnorning greeted them with warm sunshine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek black Maybach glided to a stop before the Capitol&#39;s Civil Affairs Bureau. As the door clicked open,a polished leather shoe touched the pavement with absolute poise. Megan emerged, radiant in ivory lace that gleamed like morning sun on fresh snow. Tristan followed, his charcoal suit impeccably tailored, and offered his arm. &#34;Shall we, Mrs. Reid?&#34; he murmured,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his voice a velvet promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ascended the marble steps together, the air humming with anticipation. Inside, a sharp-eyed clerk glanced up, recognition flashing across his face. &#34;Mr.Reid! Your application is prioritized.&#34; He gestured towards a private ceremony room,its arched windows framing Capitol City&#39;s awakening skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clerk began the vows, Megan&#39;s fingers tightened around Tristan&#39;s. &#34;I plight my troth to you,&#34;she declared, gaze fierce, &#34;through boardrooms and battlegrounds.&#34; Beneath her hand, Tristan&#39;s low laugh resonated. &#34;I vow to dismantle every obstacle,&#34; he countered, sliding the platinum band onto her finger,&#34;to champion your ambition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,wedding bells mingled with the stirring city,heralding the first</p>
