                <p>The night grew darker, and the light drizzle turned into a heavy downpour. Rain hammered against the windows, creating a rhythmic tapping sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the lavishly decorated room, the crystal chandelier cast a cold glow, illuminating the dark-themed oil paintings on the walls. The whole place had an eerie vibe, like the air itself was too thick to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man sat on the couch with his legs crossed,casually swirling the red wine in his crystal goblet,the smile on his lips not reaching his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man dressed in black stepped into the room,carrying a sniper rifle case. He paused, glanced down at his soaked shoes, and frowned before quickly backing out.  Two wet footprints were left on the expensive Persian rug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was rain or sweat, a droplet slipped down from the tip of the man&#39;s nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping nervously, he said, &#34;Boss, I failed the mission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man lifted his gaze lazily. His sharp, fox-like eyes were laced with amusement. &#34;Tristan took out a dozen of our elite guys by himself. Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in black lowered his head even more. &#34;The chip went off.Everything&#39;s gone. The Reids and the cops won&#39;t find a single clue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man took a slow sip of wine. His Adam&#39;s apple moved slightly as he swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one in black couldn&#39;t read the boss&#39;s expression,and asking was definitely out of the question. He just kept stealing glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment their eyes met, those cold,viper-like eyes made him look away instantly. The man let out a quiet laugh. &#34;Do I really look that scary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying wouldn&#39;t end well. The guy could be gutting someone just because he woke up in a bad mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But admitting it? Even worse-could send him straight to hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was stuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man uncrossed his legs and set his glass on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm stride, he walked over to the window and wiped away the fog on the glass with one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reflection appeared-sharp features, dangerously charming. He smiled faintly. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect that woman to know how to handle a gun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Calm, accurate, and brutal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man suddenly turned around. &#34;Think she&#39;s a good match for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in black had no idea what answer was safe,  so he kept his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Wyatt doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s moving as planned. Took the CEO position at Robinson Group and already aligned with the Bennette and Channing families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man traced a faint outline of a woman&#39;s face on the window. &#34;Wyatt&#39;s hot-headed. You&#39;re his assistant-keep him in check. Make sure he doesn&#39;t mess things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the silhouette on the foggy glass and smiled faintly. &#34;The Lewis family will have a hard time getting that land now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think the Reids will intervene?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man walked back to the couch, pulled out a cigarette from the case, lit it up, and exhaled slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the rising smoke, he said with a faint smile,&#34;Oliver has too much pride. He won&#39;t go begging Tristan for help. You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black-clad man nodded and left, closing the door softly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s gaze fell on the phone screen, where a photo of a woman wearing a dazzling starlight gown glowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of his lips curled into a slow, wicked grin.&#34;Megan, we&#39;ll be seeing each other soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Tristan and Megan went to the police station for their statements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried the officers might not be friendly toward her,Ryan personally handled her questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan recounted the entire incident in detail,clearly and calmly.Other than Tristan having someone shadow Molly and Amelia, and planting a tracker and bug in her phone, there wasn&#39;t much else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, following and filming police arrests without reporting it could bring about some serious consequences.  Ryan chuckled, &#34;Mrs. Reid, are you seriously saying those videos were made by them hiring someoneto film willingly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shrugged, putting on an innocent face.&#34;Well,with the kind of people they are, it&#39;s not shocking if someone with a strong sense of justice felt the need to expose what they&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan stared at her, deadpan. She didn&#39;t even blink while making stuff up-dude had to give her props.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could beat a lie detector without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the verdict on Sophia and Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan answered, &#34;Sophia got the death penalty for murder. But she&#39;s appealed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hah,&#34; Megan sneered, her lips curling coldly. &#34;She&#39;s got the nerve, I&#39;ll give her that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan frowned, confused. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s got a serious ego problem. Killed someone over a decade ago, then plotted the destruction of the entire Reid family, and now she thinks she can appeal? Please.&#34; Megan rubbed her fingers together.&#34;Looks like unless we keep up the pressure, she&#39;s just gonna keep wasting oxygen. What about Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan coughed lightly, &#34;She got ten years. But yep,she&#39;s appealing too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Premeditated murder, serious charges-ten years is already lenient. Honestly? She should rot in there forever.&#34; Megan grabbed her handbag and stood up.&#34;If there&#39;s nothing else, Captain Mitchell, I&#39;ll be heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan didn&#39;t dare say much-this woman looked sweet but played hardball when needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He politely opened the door with a gesture. &#34;Mrs.Reid,this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded slightly and exited the interrogation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Tristan stepped out from another  room. He slipped his arm around her waist. &#34;They didn&#39;t give you a hard time, did they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; Megan shook her head, lips pursed. &#34;But I just heard both Sophia and Natalie are planning to appeal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan saw the sour look on her face and immediately called Linus Blake. &#34;I heard Sophia and Natalie are trying to appeal. Handle it ASAP.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan twitched at the corner of his mouth. Wasn&#39;t this the same woman who sounded like a mafia boss in the other room? Now she&#39;s all soft and sweet? What a switch-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, Ryan&#39;s phone rang. He answered, and his frown went deeper-he looked like someone just force-fed him garbage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, he looked at Tristan and Megan.&#34;Natalie&#39;s distant relative is coming to bail her out.Says they want a psych evaluation done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Distant relative? Who&#39;s that supposed to be?&#34;  Ryan gave Megan a hesitant look. &#34;Stella Lewis-matriarch of the Lewis family. Before marrying into the Lewis family, her name was Stella Banks..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk about complicated connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s Jason&#39;s mom. If she didn&#39;t raise a fuss when her son got stabbed, she probably won&#39;t say much now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Megan still needed Brandon from their family to treat her grandpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Stella came in full force to pull strings and Megan pushed back too fiercely, what if the old lady flat-out refused to let Brandon help? That&#39;d be a disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Might as well play nice and withdraw the case.</p>
