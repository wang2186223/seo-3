                <p>Meanwhile, in the CEO&#39;s office on the 88th floor of Reid Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan watched the video of Megan beating up Sophia,and the corners of his lips curled up in a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand suddenly reached out and snatched his phone away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! Your wife&#39;s got guts!&#34; Kevin&#39;s eyes went wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned back lazily in his chair. &#34;Guts? I&#39;d say she was being kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin almost dropped his jaw. &#34;Sixty hits, man! That cane your family uses is practically a weapon! But honestly... kinda satisfying to watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the only onewho&#39;s ever dared teach that witch of a stepmom a lesson,&#34; Kevin added with admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled. &#34;You sure you still wanna be her brother-in-law? It might come with a life insurance clause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin stood silent for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his chin, mumbling to himself,&#34;What kind of gift would be good enough for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan replied effortlessly, &#34;Please. With a face like hers, anything else is just background noise.&#34;  Kevin stared at him, speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan fixed his gaze on him. &#34;You&#39;ve got a chance to prove yourself. I want fifty Star Point micro bugs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin choked. &#34;Dude! Prof. XAL just gave us the design two days ago, and you already want fifty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a problem?&#34; Tristan raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin instantly backtracked. &#34;Nope. Not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s expression turned colder as a thought crossed his mind. &#34;Kevin, keep an eye on our internal staff. I sent people to the black market- turns out a new type of listening device is out. Ours are one millimeter. Theirs are two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s brows knit tightly. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Reid family&#39;s old residence-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey stared intently at the chessboard, holding a piece between his fingers for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce burst into laughter. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Got cocky too soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey shot him a sharp look. &#34;Ever heard of &#39;no talking while watching&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce shrugged and sipped his tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the sound of a stone hitting the board broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked up a white pieceand placed it swiftly on the board. &#34;Congrats, Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey looked up, surprised. &#34;I won?&#34; &#34;Nope. You lost- big time,&#34; she said with a cheeky smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce laughed so hard he slapped his thigh. &#34;Geoffrey,that granddaughter-in-law of yours has quite the attitude!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey quickly reached for two fallen pieces. &#34;No way,we&#39;re not counting that. That spot didn&#39;t count.I&#39;m redoing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce raised a brow. &#34;Tsk, you&#39;re actually reneging on a move? Guess chess style mirrors character-not too impressive, old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey snorted. &#34;I was just a bit drowsy earlier.This time I&#39;m wide awake. Let&#39;s go again.&#34;Megan grinned,&#34;Alright, but Grandpa, how about we make this a bit more interesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you have in mind?&#34; Geoffrey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed a sly smile. &#34;If I win, you owe me three favors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Deal. But what if you lose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shrugged casually. &#34;As long as it&#39;s not life-or-death or anything between me and Tristan, I&#39;m in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little trickster,&#34; he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reset the board and started playing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Nathan entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood up and nodded politely, &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan replied with a soft grunt, taking in the lively  atmosphere with a complex expression. &#34;I&#39;m heading upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he disappeared up the stairs, Megan mumbled,&#34;Feels like he&#39;s still upset over Aunt Sophia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey followed his son with his eyes too, then laughed, &#34;Maybe, maybe not. Come on, your move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the sound of the door slamming echoed through the hall-&#34;Bang!&#34; It hit the wall and bounced back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan stormed into the room and slammed the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was lying on the bed whie Mrs. Ford applied ointment on her bruised back-it was covered in angry,purple welts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt stood at the side, glaring. &#34;Dad, Megan didn&#39;t even try to get the facts straight! She just went after me and Mom! She hit Mom sixty times!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan shot him a cold look. &#34;You brat. Just got out of the hospital and already making trouble. You two are a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you hadn&#39;t pushed Megan&#39;s buttons, would she have done that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, Megan&#39;s totally twisting the truth!&#34; Sophia wailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s tone was firm, voice biting. &#34;You think I&#39;m a senile old man now? Letting her do whatever she wants without reason?  If you&#39;re going to claim someone framed you,at least make it believable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You two better clean up your act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia didn&#39;t expect a scolding instead of sympathy.Her voice cracked, &#34;She disrespected me and beat me like crazy! One day she&#39;ll come after you too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan narrowed his eyes. &#34;Sophia, you&#39;re beyond help. Don&#39;t try to push my buttons with that nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I ever really mess up, so what if someone knocks sense into me?	1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if you&#39;re so unhappy here, then just sign the damn divorce papers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia screamed after him, &#34;You&#39;ve always missed Henrietta,that dead woman! I never stood a chance,neither did Wyatt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s steps faltered for a second, but he didn&#39;t look back. He just said coldly, &#34;I&#39;m glad you know.You&#39;re the one who broke us apart. You&#39;ve always known that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he disappeared down the hallway, Sophia broke down in sobs, her voice echoing with grief and anger.She turned to Mrs. Ford, her pain twisting into rage.&#34;Get out! You&#39;re laughing at me too, aren&#39;t you?Leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Ford quickly set down the ointment and slipped out of the room in silence.Wyatt glanced at the sobbing Sophia and said, &#34;Mom, stop crying already.  After this Saturday, Megan and Tristan will be done with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sobs stopped instantly. She stared at him, her voice shaking, &#34;Ash, are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;Absolutely. Once we bring Tristan down, the whole Reid family will be ours. Geoffrey, Nathan... they won&#39;t matter at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very Geoffrey who was currently sitting across from Megan with a face that could cry a river. Hle&#39;d always thought of himself as a Go master-until today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, he asked, &#34;Megan, who taught you to play?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked and said mischievously, &#34;Totally self-taught!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey paused, clearly stunned. &#34;Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded with a straight face. No way was she spilling the beans about studying under international Go master Justin while on exchange in France.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey looked genuinely distressed. &#34;I really lost this game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel chimed in from the side with a comforting tone,Grandpa,you know how every generation builds on the last? Don&#39;t take it the wrong way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,was that supposed to be comforting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey felt like his granddaughter was going to stress him into the grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, a black Bentley rolled into the old estate.  As Tristan stepped out, a petite figure ran right into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, I missed you so much today!&#34; Megan chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a soft kiss to her smooth forehead. &#34;Did you now? Somehow I feel like you had a pretty eventful day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted slightly. &#34;You have no idea! Rachel and I almost got ganged up on today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan fought back a chuckle. Right now,his wife was the picture of fake innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me everything. I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling for effect, Megan said, &#34;As soon as Rachel and I walked in, that mother-son duo started throwing shade. Mister Lies said Rachel was adopted from an orphanage, and Sophia said she lost her appetite just looking at us. So, I stepped up as the lady of the house and gave &#39;em a little taste of justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mister Lies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wyatt, duh. He&#39;s full of lies and hides behind a polished facade!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan couldn&#39;t help rolling his eyes. Where did she even come up with this stuff?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;You call that just a little punishment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already seen the footage-every swing of that stick had landed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded firmly. &#34;Yup, super gentle. I didn&#39;t even eat while dealing with that witch!&#34; Tristan shook his head slightly. &#34;My sweet Megan,you&#39;re just too kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel, who overheard every word, had to admit-Megan truly had top-tier&#34;Oscar Acting&#34; skills, and Tristan was totally whipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly? She kinda loved it.</p>
