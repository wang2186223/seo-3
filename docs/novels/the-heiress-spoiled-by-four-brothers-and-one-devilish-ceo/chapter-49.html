                <p>CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan sat on the long couch, while Bruce took a seat in the armchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan handed out two steaming cups of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, you&#39;ve been off the grid for years. Are you back for Grandpa&#39;s birthday this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce took the coffee and gave a satisfied hum after the first sip. &#34;Finally get to enjoy a cup of coffee brewed by my future granddaughter-in-law,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his tone shifted. &#34;But no, I&#39;m not here for that old man&#39;s birthday. I came to issue a warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A warning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan frowned. Megan raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce set his cup on the table and reached into his coat-pullingout a worn leather pouch. From it, he slid out a small deck of Tarot cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did a reading before I came,&#34; he said, shuffling the cards with surprising grace for someone his age.&#34;Death reversed, followed by the Tower. Not great signs. Then the Ten of Swords. That sealed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan propped her chin on her hand, already zoning out halfway through the explanation. Bruce laid the cards out in a spread, then tapped one.&#34;It points to a serious health crisis coming for Tristan&#39;s grandfather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked, trying to stay polite. &#34;So... you couldn&#39;t have just said that from the start?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce gave a slow shrug. &#34;Where&#39;s the flair in that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sighed internally. Okay, so he was one of those people. Tarot uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still... sometimes even the weirdest stuff turns out to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned forward, expression darkening. &#34;Can you tell if the illness is natural or... caused?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;It&#39;s not fate. It&#39;s man-made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was mid-sip and nearly choked on her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for a napkin to dab at the spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay,this is getting creepier by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce looked at Megan with a kindly smile. &#34;Megan,fate brought the two of you together across lifetimes.Don&#39;t take it for granted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan froze for a second. Wait. does he know something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled calmly. &#34;Got it, Uncle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After chatting a bit more, Bruce left, accompanied by Cameron, headed to the Reid family&#39;s old estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Tristan lost in thought,Megan gently massaged his temples. &#34;Come on, it might not be accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t worry too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan held her hand. &#34;Megan, Uncle Stewart&#39;s never been wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Megan didn&#39;t know was that in a past life, Bruce had predicted Tristan would die for a woman-and in the end, he did, staying by her side till the very end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up. Wasn&#39;t this the perfect excuse to set up surveillance in the old house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, she could keep tabs on Wyatt any time she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat. &#34;Then let&#39;s act before anything happens. We&#39;ll move into the old estate and secretly set up cameras in every room. Just in case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s sharp eyes narrowed slightly. After a long moment, he nodded. &#34;Okay. We&#39;ll move in tomorrow and get the cameras installed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was lost in thought and didn&#39;t notice the flicker of cunning in Megan&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting up,he gently pulled her into his arms. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s grab some lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ruffled her hair fondly. &#34;Break room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her hand, he led her to the adjoining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The break room was still decked out in minimalist black and white. There was a large bed, a long sofa,and a coffee table-low key in design, but obviously expensive.  A meal cart sat beside the table, covered with six dish domes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan had her sit down while he handled the rest,lifting the covers to reveal six gourmet dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pan-seared short ribs, marjoram salmon rolls, seared scallops with foie gras sauce, Cajun-style crayfish,bouillabaisse, and a heavy French-style cheesecake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single item was one of Megan&#39;s favorites.&#34;To win over this little foodie, I gotta win over her stomach first.&#34; Tristan said with a straight face as he sliced up the short ribs and slid the plate in front of her. &#34;Let me feed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so began their feeding-each-other moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finished the main course, Megan scooped up some soup and held it to Tristan&#39;s lips. &#34;Babe, open up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she could still see that hint of worry on his handsome face. Megan took a sip first, then gently cupped his jaw and kissed him, letting the warm broth pass from her mouth to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, she whispered, &#34;In this lifetime,I wanna be the spoon that feeds you milk and soup.and your favorite cuddle buddy at night. I wanna be the one who always hugs you tight. So you better smile more, &#39;cause when you&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy too. No matter what happens, I&#39;m right here with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips tilted into a smile. &#34;Okay.&#34; Then Megan picked up a spoonful of cake. &#34;Try this.Good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot a glance at the beautifully plated dessert mumbling, &#34;But it&#39;s Michelin three-star. lemme try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scooped a bit for herself. &#34;Hmm, not bad at all.&#34;&#34;Yeah? Let me have another taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Tristan leaned in and kissed her,licking the cream off her lips with his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned. &#34;Told you-your lips make everything taste better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more time Megan spent with Tristan, the more she realized just how smooth this man could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their meal, Tristan pulled her onto the big bed,wrapping his arms around her from behind and gently rubbing her round belly. &#34;You&#39;re so full it looks like you&#39;re carrying a baby in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan giggled. &#34;Nah, that&#39;s just a whole lotta poop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three black lines appeared on Tristan&#39;s forehead-yep,her mouth really wasn&#39;t made for sweet talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, I heard about a guy who couldn&#39;t get past seeing his wife constipated. Would you feel the same way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also heard-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned her face toward him, pinched her cheeks,  and shut her up with a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, however, was the one suffering the most.Again, he ended up in a cold shower,while someone was comfortably starfishing under the covers,dreaming away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan finally woke up, she found him staring at her quietly. She snuggled into his chest. &#34;Babe, I was dreaming. You went to play with water again,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan clenched his jaw. Play with water? That&#39;s what she called it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he got up fast-he wasn&#39;t planning to spend another minute burning up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a soft lavender dress and a pair of silver 7cm heels from the closet, setting them by the bed.&#34;Time to go. We&#39;re headingto the charity auction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan quickly got up and started changing right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan spun around in a flash-any longer and he might actually get a nosebleed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction? Nearly died laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dressed, she patted his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;m ready.Time for makeup!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hopped off the bed, fished her makeup bag from her backpack, and headed into the bathroom to put on a light, natural look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out again, she noticed Tristan had also changed into a deep charcoal suit. His model-like  build really didn&#39;t need any help-he looked hot either way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her lipstick, she grinned. &#34;Time for the Reid-style application.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan strode over, applied the color to his lips, then cupped her chin and pressed a kiss to her lips,leaving a perfect hint of cherry blossom pink behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, he tucked her makeup back into the bag,slung it over his shoulder, and held out his arm. &#34;Let&#39;s go,Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>八</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looped her arm through his. &#34;Right behind you,Mr.Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it hit her. &#34;Oh right, Rachel&#39;s going tonight too.&#34;</p>
