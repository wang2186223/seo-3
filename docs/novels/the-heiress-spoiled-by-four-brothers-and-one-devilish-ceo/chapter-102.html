                <p>The sudden noise startled Amelia, making her drop the little paper packet in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly bent down to grab it and shoved it into her sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, she turned around with a small smile. &#34;You&#39;re back, Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stood with his hands in his pockets, eyes cool and slightly scrutinizing. &#34;What were you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Mr. Exton brought back a ton of groceries,&#34;Amelia said, her lips curving. &#34;Since Mom and Dad are home,I figured I&#39;d cook a few dishes for them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver gave a faint nod. &#34;Alright, carry on then.&#34; With that,he turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia finally let out the breath she&#39;d been holding.That really almost scared the life out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers were still trembling a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed back to her room and slipped the paper into her Hermès bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she changed into a simple sporty outfit, went downstairs, and calmly headed for the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had zero cooking skills-claiming to cook was just an excuse. In reality, she was just helping out beside the chef,nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At lunch, Stella was all praises for Amelia&#39;s&#34;cooking.&#34;Oliver glanced at her. &#34;That was thoughtful of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia smiled brightly. &#34;Thanks, Oliver. As long as Mom enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella suddenly asked, &#34;Is Natalie&#39;s evaluation result out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver chuckled dryly. &#34;Yeah. Experts at the Third Psychiatric Hospital confirmed that she has serious mental disorders-split personality and mania. Looks like she&#39;ll be staying in treatment for the foreseeable future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella wasn&#39;t surprised-she knew the Reid famnily wouldn&#39;t let this go easily. She was also fully aware of everything Natalie had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own son got injured because of that woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s mother, Nancy, somehow got her phone number and called in tears, begging her to help get Natalie out of jail. Stella had only agreed not to press charges, not to hand the girl back untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Reid family wasn&#39;t backing down, there wasn&#39;t much she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No point sparking a full-on feud between the Reids and the Lewis family over someone irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel set down his chopsticks. &#34;Natalie brought that on herself. I remember you two used to be pretty tight, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under his gaze, Amelia tightened her grip on her chopsticks. &#34;I stopped hanging out with her once l realized she had issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t pick up on her being mentally unstable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia frowned slightly. &#34;I did think she acted... a bit extreme at times. I guess that explains the crazy stunts she pulled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel gave a snort. &#34;Birds of a feather-just make sure you&#39;re more careful next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got it, Samuel,&#34; she said sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Samuel pulled out his phone and dialed.&#34;Megan?It&#39;s Sam! My mom&#39;s a huge fan of yours. Got some time tomorrow? She&#39;d love to swing by for a custom outfit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sam!&#34; Megan , curled up in Tristan&#39;s arms munching on fruit, laughed. &#34;Sure, I&#39;m free. Brandon&#39;s flight got delayed by the storm anyway. Just come by my studio at school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool, let&#39;s chat more at my place then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he hung up, Stella blinked at him, puzzled.&#34;Sam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and pointed at her. &#34;This is the nickname Megan gave me..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39; heart sank the second she heard Stella was meeting up with Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman really did have some resemblance to Stella... What if she turned out to be the real Lewis  daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying her best to stay calm, Amelia asked, &#34;When are Grandpa and Grandma coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zachary took a sip of water. &#34;Probably next week. The forest&#39;s getting chilly-almost time to come back for the fall and winter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every year at the start of summer, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis would head out to their lodge in the deep mountains to escape the heat, then return home before winter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Amelia finally relaxed. As long as Grandma came home,she&#39;d be fine-Grandma always doted on her the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Dreamscape Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sat cross-legged, leaning against Tristan&#39;s chest, her mouth open, waiting for him to feed her some fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the shiny silver fork holding a strawberry just hovered there, not moving an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to look at him and noticed the gloomy look on his face. &#34;What? Did you eat something gross?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan let out a helpless laugh and popped the strawberry in his own mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her pout from disappointment, he pinched her chin playfully. &#34;You really planning to go visit another guy&#39;s place?&#34; Megan finally realized-jeez, this man&#39;s jealous again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scooted around to wrap her arms around his neck.&#34;Huh? What&#39;s that sour smell all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan turned his head to the side, looking all proud and aloof. &#34;Make it up to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed the red berry juice still on the corner of his lips and leaned in. Her tongue flicked over it,tasting the sweetness. &#34;So my hubby&#39;s lips do taste like strawberries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes darkened, and he rolled her onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers,cool and gentle,brushed across her cheek.&#34;We&#39;re good for today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan poked the injury on his side. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Depends. HHurts when I want you to care. Doesn&#39;t hurt when I need to get serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised a brow. &#34;Wait, what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I want pity, it hurts. When duty calls, I&#39;m all good again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, Tristan was pretty much everything women dreamed of-just looking at him made your brain short -circuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second of eye contact and it felt like you could get swept away anytimne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth sunk into her bottom lip,leaving a soft pink mark, cheeks blushing prettily. &#34;Stop it. Dr. Adams said you need rest,remember?&#34; Tristan buried his lips into her soft neck, his warm breath tickling against her skin, turning it a gentle pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes slid shut on instinct, totally unaware of how alluring she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hovered close, chuckling softly. &#34;I don&#39;t think Mrs.Reid wants me resting at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes flew open-so he&#39;d been messing with her this whole time?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed and pressed her hands to his firm chest.&#34;Move,I want more fruit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan took her hand, kissed her fingertips, then slowly guided it down his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nervously swallowed, her lashes trembling ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, she was definitely feeling the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s lips trailed from her forehead, to between her brows,along her lashes, and down to her tiny nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,his warm mouth found hers, softly stealing the sweetness between her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers, light and daring, slipped under the hem of her silk nightgown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything unfolded so naturally</p>
