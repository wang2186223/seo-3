                <p>The oxygen level in the lab kept climbing, and Zeta Prime was pacing nervously back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech&#39;s tail was dripping oil all over Zeta Prime&#39;s oversized face, the streaks strangely looking like tear tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Megan sat there like she was on vacation,looking totally chill and unbothered by the rising oxygen concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A robotic voice announced, &#34;Lab oxygen concentration has reached 20%. Warning! Warning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, Zeta Prime tossed the jittery Nova Tech off his head and started spinning his meta finger on his dome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked. &#34;...ls he trying to be a cartoon monk or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a devilishly handsome face appeared outside the gas valve window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft beep, the valve door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a sleek black suit, Tristan strode in quickly,those long legs making fast work of the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face looked grim,eyes filled with tension, heading  straight for Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Warning lifted! Welcome back, Professor XAL!&#34; the system chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning lazily on the leather chair, Megan looked up at him with a playful smile. &#34;Professor XAL,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime and Nova Tech had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the two robots were clinging to the gas valve,peeking in curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One tall, one short, a hilariously mismatched pair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d already picked up on the fact that Tristan&#39;s emotional levels were off the charts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if proving their scans right, the man crouched down on one knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently took Megan&#39;s hand. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime: &#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech:&#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when did Mr. Cold-As-lce say sorry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned forward,fingers under his sharp jawline.&#34;Sorry for what,exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were steady. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have kept it from you-that I&#39;m XAL.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath.&#34;|fyou knew I was the one behind those tech gifts, you&#39;d be wary.&#34; Megan raised an eyebrow. &#34;So you think I couldn&#39;t tell you were playing tricks? Come on, spill it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice dropped to a guilty mumble. &#34;I made the fingerprint cuffs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, afraid she&#39;d take off again, he had made a special pair that only his fingerprint could unlock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan couldn&#39;t break free, she went on a hunger strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later she even asked who made the cuffs-said if she found out, she&#39;d make sure they disappeared from Earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified she&#39;d hate the creator, he lied, saying they were from some tech mogul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way could he admit it was him-not when that might push her away for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan leaned closer again, eyes twinkling. &#34;What about the tiny tracker in my phone? That too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan froze. Leave it to her to catch even that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The micro-tracker came with both tracking and listening functions. able to work even if the phone was trashed or deep underwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising three fingers, Tristan said solemnly, &#34;Megan,l swear, I only wanted to track your location. I didn&#39;t eavesdrop on your calls. Cross my heart-if I&#39;m lying,may I be struck by -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, her delicate finger pressed lightly against his lips.&#34;I don&#39;t wanna hear any  promises,&#34; Megan twirled her fingertip along Tristan&#39;s lips, a wicked smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.&#34;So, tell me-how should I punish you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan blinked those thick lashes of his, looking just like some shy husband being teased by his fearless wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his eyes. &#34;Up to you. Whatever makes you feel better-as long as you&#39;re not walking away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Megan&#39;s smile deepened. Clearly, Tristan was seriously freaked out by the idea of her leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted his chin up. &#34;Do we still have that fingerprint handcuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes flicked up in surprise. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then register my print. This time, I&#39;m tying you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan: &#34;...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Megan grabbed his hand and dragged him out of the lab, up from the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta Prime and Nova Tech collapsed where they stood. &#34;Holy crap! Glad we didn&#39;t get disassembled!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova kicked her legs around like crazy. &#34;Nova wants Goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeta knocked her metal head. &#34;You dumb pup!Goddess&#39;s about to give Boss some serious payback.You sneak&lt; a peek, you&#39;re toast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova gave up struggling, her head spinning in all directions. &#34;What kind of payback?&#34; Zeta chuckled darkly. &#34;Handcuff games. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the room, Megan dug out the handcuffs from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan updated the fingerprint lock; she added her thumbprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next second, off came his suit jacket-then his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His well-toned chest was instantly exposed,pumping masculine energy all over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stood by the bed, dazed, just letting her do her thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he knew it, she shoved him back onto the soft bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled his hands up and cuffed them to each side of the bedpost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straddling his abs, she trailed one finger down to his throat.&#34;So? You think this punishment works?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s heart was going wild. Usually, he was the one teasing her; now, the tables had turned, and it was messing with him-bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been holding off for this, waiting for her birthday,or maybe the wedding day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if this was how she wanted it... well... fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cool fingers glided down his chest and over his abs, sending heat rushing under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed. &#34;Megan, I... this is torture...  come on, be good,get off...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Megan ignored him, hands behind her back. With a loud &#34;click,&#34; she unlocked his belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s brow furrowed.&#34;Megan,you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly pulled a face, then jumped off the bed and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flirted and fled-just like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stared after her, cuffed wrists tugging against the restraint. Yep. Locked-up wasn&#39;t exactly comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t felt the need to trap her before, he wouldn&#39;t have even thought of using these on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t regret it. At least, she was emotionally his now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change in her was wild-like a completely different person. Still, he loved this new version like crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring blankly at the ceiling, he tried to calm the burning tension in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Megan peeked out from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought he was asleep-the way he was lying there,eyes softly closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, she tiptoed over to the bed and stretched her body closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly-those sharp,narrow phoenix eyes snapped open!</p>
