                <p>Sometimes fate really just sneaks up on you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was still wondering when exactly she&#39;d found her way into Tristan&#39;s heart, when his fiery kiss totally messed with her train of thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sudden buzz of a phone, shattering the sweet moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown, Tristan pulled his phone out-Kevin Ward was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the phone at arm&#39;s length, he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan! Drinks tonight at Prestige! Kai&#39;s back in town!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan didn&#39;t even hesitate. &#34;Not going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kevin clearly wasn&#39;t done. The screen kept lighting up like the guy didn&#39;t get the hint. Tristan was about to block him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go, your friend&#39;s back. It&#39;s fine,&#34; Megan said with a light chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan held her hands between his. &#34;Then come with me. I want you to meet them properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, more buzzing. Tristan&#39;s brows furrowed  when he saw the caller ID-Old House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tristan, heard you got registered this morning. Come over for dinner tonight,&#34; said Nathan&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Tristan could speak, the other side rushed to add, &#34;Your grandpa&#39;s looking forward to meeting your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s face darkened. Playing the grandpa card?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey was the only one in that whole family who&#39;d ever genuinely cared about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clear annoyance,he replied,&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, he looked at Megan. &#34;So word spread fast. Looks like we&#39;re headed to the old house.We&#39;ll say hi to Grandpa, then bounce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan narrowed her fox-like eyes. This had Molly and Wyatt written all over it. No way this news traveled that fast on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a little smirk. &#34;It&#39;s alright. If your grandpa&#39;s good to you, we should go see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the beach and got on the road to the Reid family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Tristan seemed to want to say something but hesitated. Finally,he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, I am not actually the legitimate heir of the Reid family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced her way, trying to feel out her reaction Her eyes were calm, no trace of judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Encouraged, he went on, &#34;My mom, Hannah,married my dad on paper, but because she came from nothing my grandma never accepted her. They ended up getting divorced. Mom left the Capitol City and went to a rural town to teach. That&#39;s when she found out she was pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan choked up, his eyes seemed slightly moist, and he continued, &#34;She had me anyway. We didn&#39;t have much, but we were happy. Then, when I was eight, she got lung cancer. She sent me back to the Reids and quietly passed away alone. She didn&#39;t take any help from my father. Three months later, she was gone.The funeral was just me and him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice softened, tinged with anger. &#34;I hated him for a long time. Felt like he never truly loved her.That he cared more about the family name than about her.After that,he married into the Carter family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his hands tightly, then looked at Megan said slowly, &#34;So... things between me and him were never great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan reached over, squeezing his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone&#39;s got an inner scale. Balancing love,friendship, family-and gain. Not everyone gets it right.Some people lean more into feelings, sacrificing benefits, but gaining warmth. Others chase advantage,and end up emotionally empty. Life doesn&#39;t favor anyone. Who knows, maybe your dad hasn&#39;t had it  easy either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan noticed a hint of contempt and anger in Tristan&#39;s eyes, so she gently stroked his hand and comforted him, &#34;I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re supposed to forgive him. Or feel better because he might be miserable. I just want you to let go of that bitterness,even just a little. So you can be happy, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently stroked Tristan&#39;s face, her heart full of love &#34;You&#39;ve got me. I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not gonna look down on me for where I come from, are you?&#34;he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man, this business tycoon who dominated boardrooms, was suddenly so unsure-like a kid afraid of being left behind. He was that scared of losing her.Megan let out a soft sigh and leaned her cheek against Tristan&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From now on, no matter if you&#39;re rich or broke,healthy or not, I won&#39;t leave you. Silly, I love you,l Love for who you are-not for what you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Tristan heard her say that last part, he froze for a second. She just said she loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly switched lanes and pulled over on the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her by the shoulders, he asked, &#34;Megan,say that again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pinched his handsome cheek and smiled. &#34;Tristan,I love you. Maybe it feels sudden to you, but for me.l  just don&#39;t want to miss out on you anymore. I&#39;m in this with you,for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her into his arms, holding her like she was the only light breaking through the storm in his world.She was his saving grace. And he? He was hers too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reid family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop in front of a three-meter-high iron gate with intricate designs.After the license plate was scanned, the gate opened automatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drove past a path flanked by manicured lawns and circled a fountain before stopping in front of a European-style mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan got out first and opened the car door for Megan,helping her out gently.Fingers interlocked,the two walked toward the main house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Tristan&#39;s brows knitted together as he yanked her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fast-flying golf ball zipped past Megan&#39;s head,slamming into the gate behind them with a loud &#34;bang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had hit just a second later, it would&#39;ve nailed the back of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Megan said, shaking her head</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two followed the path of the golf ball and locked eyes with a tall, sharp-featured man walking toward them with a club in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes had a hint of cold cruelty, and his sharp nose gave him a calculating, almost sinister look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, big bro&#39;s back,&#34; he mocked. &#34;And look who we have here-the runaway fiancée herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt. Tristan&#39;s half-brother. The same bastard who,in a poast life, helped Molly take Megan&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze turned icy cold. He let go of Megan and strode straight toward Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why so mad, Tris-&#34;	八、</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Tristan had him by the neck,lifting him off the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt raised the club, trying to strike Tristan, but his arm was pinned midair the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s grip tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s face turned crimson, eyes bulging, blood vessels popping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between gritted teeth, Tristan growled, &#34;Try that again,and I swear I&#39;ll end you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he flung Wyatt down onto the lawn and slammed the golf club across his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once. Twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where she stood, Megan watched coldly, like she&#39;d been thrown back into her past life-Wyatt plunging that icy blade into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stare was blank, emotionless. When Wyatt finally coughed up blood, and the club was just an inch away from smashing his skull, Tristan stopped, hovering the club midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it?&#34; Tristan&#39;s voice was like frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt coughed hard,wiped the blood from his mouth,and stammered, &#34;Y-yeah, I got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan walked over and stood beside Tristan,looking down on Wyatt like he was nothing more than filth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, she said, &#34;Babe, the place is impressive,but the staff really need some training. You&#39;d think someone would&#39;ve taken out the trash by now. The stench here really calls for a little air freshener.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan wrapped an arm around her waist and led her toward the mansion.&#34;Yeah, a full retraining is in order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Wyatt glared at their backs with fury,punching the ground as rage burned through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan always had the upper hand-but one day,he&#39;d make him pay. And since he cared so much about that woman,she&#39;d be the first to fall.</p>
