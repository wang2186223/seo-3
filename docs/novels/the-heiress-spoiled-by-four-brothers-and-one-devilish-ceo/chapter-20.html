                <p>The girl stood up politely and nodded. &#34;Yes, Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at the shy girl walking toward her-Lina Reid,Julian&#39;s daughter.From a past life, she vaguely remembered her. Lina had been classmates and close friends with Megan&#39;s sister, Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,want me to show you around a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the mansion and headed toward the man-made lake behind it. The lake shimmered in a soft green hue, with the breeze stirring gentle ripples across the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, my mom sometimes talks without thinking.Don&#39;t take her words too seriously,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled. &#34;I wasn&#39;t really bothered by your mom today-just that third aunt&#39;s words were kinda outta line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina let out a sigh. &#34;She&#39;s been married into the Reids for years but never had kids. Uncle&#39;s never exactly lived like a saint either... so she&#39;s got a lot of pent-up anger and tends to take it out on everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s like that with everybody, really. Just tune her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,got it.&#34;  &#34;Lina!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crisp voice called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned and saw a girl in a bright red dress walking over, long black hair down to her shoulders, and a sweet-looking face that instantly caught attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina waved at her and whispered, &#34;That&#39;s Rachel, my aunt&#39;s adopted daughter. She&#39;s about your age.They&#39;ve been living in France, didn&#39;t expect her to show up today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl stepped up, gave Lina a big hug, then turned to Megan. &#34;And who&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina smiled brightly. &#34;Sis, this is Tristan&#39;s wife, Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel immediately hugged Megan, eyes bright and clear. &#34;Hi! I&#39;m Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had never met her before. All those novels and dramas had made her cautious around characters like &#34;adopted daughters&#34;-you never knew if they had that fake sweet thing going on like Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she kept things polite. &#34;Nice to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Rachel already had an arm around her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the nonstop chatter, sounding more like a nosy aunt than someone her age. &#34;Girl, what were you thinking, trying to run away from a wedding?Tristan is tall, handsome, stylish-every rich girl in town drools over him, and you almost passed him up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two finally got together now, huh? I mean, if you  hadn&#39;t bailed on the engagement six months ago,you&#39;d probably be married by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shoot, maybe even have a baby cooking by this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan hadn&#39;t expected someone who looked so calm and sweet to have this kind of... bold personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She covered her mouth and laughed. &#34;Six months ago I was clearly not thinking straight. Good thing I came to my senses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, glad you snapped out of it! But you best hold onto my brother tight-there are plenty of ggirls just waiting for a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel glanced at Megan&#39;s ring, then teased, &#34;Sis, that rock on your finger is massive! I&#39;m so telling my boyfriend he needs to up his game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina just shrugged helplessly and followed after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After chatting a while, it turned out that Penelope Reid -Tristan&#39;s only aunt-wasn&#39;t planning to return to France. She&#39;d brought Rachel back with her to settle down permanently in the Capital City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later back at the mansion, Rachel found Penelope chatting with Pearl and Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Penelope&#39;s arm, Rachel swayed it like a spoiled kid. &#34;Mom, Megan&#39;s studying design over at Meridian University-I wanna apply there too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope turned around and spotted Megan walking toward them.  The woman looked about forty, with an elegant face that barely showed signs of age-she could easily pass for thirty. Her gentle expression gave off a warm,welcoming vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over with a smile and held Megan&#39;s hands.&#34;You must be Megan. What a beautiful face you have.No wonder Tristan is so taken with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blushed lightly, cheeks turning pink. &#34;Thank you,Auntie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope glanced at the lively Rachel and said with a smile, &#34;Rachel, you could learn a thing or two from Megan&#39;s calm demeanor. If you&#39;re serious about getting into Meridian University, you might want to ask Tristan for help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel chuckled, eyes gleaming with mischief. &#34;Asking Tristan won&#39;t get me anywhere-I&#39;ll just stick to his sweet wife instead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she suddenly lunged forward,throwing her arms around Megan in an exaggerated hug, even leaning in like she was about to plant a kiss on her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get close, Megan was swiftly pulled into a familiar, protective embrace-firm, possessive,and warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s low voice cut through the moment,calm but edged with danger. &#34;Touch her again, and and you&#39;ll be in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked, then pouted dramatically.,come  on, Tristan. I&#39;m a girl too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan arched a brow, his hold on Megan tightening just slightly. &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter. She&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath,&#34;Jeez.Possessive,much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling as she looked to Megan. &#34;Please,Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan met her gaze with a soft smile. &#34;If Rachel wants to get into Meridian University too,it&#39;d be nice to have a buddy in class with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at her dotingly and gently tousled her silky hair. &#34;Alright, whatever makes you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel tugged at Lina beside her. &#34;See that? Tristan actually smiles-like, full on sunshine and flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina cleared her throat. &#34;Right? First time I&#39;ve seen it too. It&#39;s kinda surreal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Mrs. Ford came over and said, &#34;Young Master, everything&#39;s ready. Lunch is served.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an arm wrapped around Megan&#39;s waist, Tristan casually led her toward the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, he said in that lazy drawl, &#34;The chef here&#39;s Michelin three-star. If you like his cooking,I&#39;ll just have him moved to our place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan hesitated, &#34;Isn&#39;t that a bit much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked at Megan lovingly and replied, &#34;As long as you like it, who cares?&#34; Geoffrey had just stepped out of the study and caught that last line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geoffrey:[Guess I&#39;ve been replaced by his wife now.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else:[Yep, we&#39;re all officially sidelined.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan:[l only care about my wife. If she&#39;s happy,that&#39;s all that matters.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The round dining table was packed with famnily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached for the wine bottle and poured Megan a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, his movements smooth and unhurried. He even topped it off with a gentle swirl, then handed it to her with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel, sitting nearby, fluttered her lashes. &#34;Tristan,don&#39;t I get a little love too? MMy glass is feeling awfully empty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a cool glance, picked up a bottle of sparkling water, and poured it into her glass instead.&#34;There. Bubbly-just like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked.Her cousin-the famously aloof Tristan -had actually poured her a drink? Even if it wasn&#39;t wine, it was... something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina nearly choked on her sip of wine, then burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; Rachel asked, narrowing her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lina leaned in with a smirk. &#34;Sparking water. Zero alcohol, zero depth-just fizz and noise. Translation?He&#39;s politely telling you to chill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel forced a smile and sipped the water like it was  Dom Pérignon, pretending not to care. But inside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep. Tristan was savage as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of lunch, everyone was stuffed-not from the food, but from the nonstop sugar overload between Tristan and Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Tristan took Megan to his old room in the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door, revealing a sleek black-and-white design, all clean lines and minimalist vibes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her hand, he led her in and shut the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I lived here from eight to fifteen. Then I left for the U.S., but someone&#39;s always been keeping it clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let&#39;s chill here for a bit. We&#39;ll head to the Prestige later tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at his ridiculously handsome face,Megan couldn&#39;t help blushing at the thought of all the &#34;newlywed&#34; things they could finally do now that they were officially married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan traced her jawline lightly and whispered,&#34;You know, your name&#39;s right next to mine now-on paper and in life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes sparkled. &#34;And I signed it with my whole heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tiptoed and kissed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, never one to resist her, pulled her tightly into his arms.  They tumbled onto the fresh-scented bed, wrapped in each other&#39;s warmth.</p>
