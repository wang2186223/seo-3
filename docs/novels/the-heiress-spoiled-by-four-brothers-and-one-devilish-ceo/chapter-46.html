                <p>Hearing Megan&#39;s teasing tone, Rachel couldn&#39;t help but click her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nickname...why did it sound so flirty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Tristan ever caught wind of it, he&#39;d definitely turn into a jealous maniac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Meg,you two that close or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot her a side glance, already guessing Rachel&#39;s brain had gone somewhere else. She clarified,&#34;His name&#39;s Samuel Lewis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel instantly got it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, that name did sound kind of epic-bold,memorable,hard to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel strolled over. &#34;Megan,grab lunch with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan calmly raised her hand, showing off the ring on her ring finger. &#34;Sorry, this married lady doesn&#39;t do lunch dates with other men. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel just shrugged. &#34;Well, I did kind of save your life yesterday. Like, that counts for something,doesn&#39;t it? Isn&#39;t there some saying about paying back a life-saving favor tenfold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan went silent. Yeah, right-like she owed him anything Rachel,who already knew what went down yesterday,was surprised. &#34;Wait, this tall dude&#39;s the one who saved you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave her a glare. &#34;You&#39;re not exactly helping here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly. &#34;Let&#39;s just meet at that café right outside campus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s smile twitched, thinking: Seriously? You scammed me out of 27 million, and we&#39;re settling this over some campus café? Real generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them ended up at Knight Café, just off campus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel took a sip of his lemon water. &#34;I just rolled out a new game, kind of geared toward women. Thing is,I don&#39;t really have many female friends, so I thought maybe you&#39;d want to try it out, Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow. &#34;Pretty sure we&#39;re not exactly friends. And if you&#39;re doing market research, plenty of girls would probably jump in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel brushed his fringe back. &#34;Yeah, but they like my looks, not my genius. So I know they&#39;re just sweet -talking me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan:[ Seriously, is there any humility in that brain?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel:[Gotta admit, loving that weird self-confidence a bit.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel handed over a USB stick to Megan. &#34;Figured you&#39;d have your laptop, since you&#39;re into design and  all. I didn&#39;t bring mine-shoulder&#39;s sore from dodging that knife yesterday. Carrying stuff kinda hurts right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel: &#34;Wait. You carried her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot Samuel an icy look, then turned to Rachel &#34;He tweaked his shoulder, sure, but he&#39;s also got a twisted tongue. Don&#39;t take him seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling her eyes, she took the USB and opened her laptop to plug it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The game started downloading. Then she gave the USB back to Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the game, she saw it was set in a classic high -fantasy world-think dragons, ancient runes, and spell -wielding warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visually, the game was stunning. The animation,effects, character designs, and outfits were all next-level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started customizing her character and picking out some seriously cool gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel was instantly hooked, eyes wide with curiosity as she leaned in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel sat nearby, calm and composed, a faintly amused smile tugging at his lips as he watched the two girls geek out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s brows slowly drew together-something was off. There was definitely a virus planted in that game software.  &#34;Ouch,&#34; she suddenly exclaimed, grabbing the laptop as she stood up and pointed toward the restroom &#34;Stomach&#39;s acting up out of nowhere, gonna dash to the bathroom. I&#39;m taking this gem with me,can&#39;t stop playing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she rounded the corner, she bumped right into the Four-Eyes guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light bulb went off in her head, and she quickly called out to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had him hide in the emergency stairwell,while she ducked into a bathroom stall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertips flew across the keyboard-the virus had some sort of money-stealing program built in. It wasn&#39;t as lethal as what she&#39;d created before, but it was enough to wreck her firewall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw-someone clearly wanted payback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In under five minutes, she wiped the virus and reinforced the firewall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out, she waved the Four-Eyes over. &#34;In a sec,just play along with whatever I say, got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four-Eyes adjusted his specs and nodded. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a slight smirk. &#34;You know the saying-when someone saves your life...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four-Eyes instantly chimed in, &#34;You owe them yours..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a look. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the main seating area, Samuel and Rachel were deep in cheerful conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan returned with Four-Eyes and slid into her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on a startled look. &#34;Geez, there was a freaking virus in your software! Good thing I ran into Four-Eyes,or all my coins in that account would&#39;ve disappeared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel narrowed his fox-like eyes with a trace of suspicion. &#34;You&#39;re saying he cracked the virus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling her foot stomp on his, Four-Eyes instantly replied, &#34;Oh yeah, piece of cake. Nothing big.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel rubbed his chin, mulling it over. &#34;You two seem pretty close,huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four-Eyes sneaked a quick glance at Megan. &#34;Uh,yeah,you could say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at her watch. &#34;I&#39;ve got something else to deal with, so I&#39;ll head out. You two keep chatting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick motion, she and Rachel slipped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot sweat was already dripping down Four-Eyes &#39;forehead. The way Samuel carried himself had him seriously on edge-nervous and overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving a small nod, he also began to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Samuel uncrossed his legs,leaned in slightly,and his voice dropped, eyes turning sharp. &#34;Let&#39;s have a little chat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked confused. &#34;Wait, what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked, a playful glint flickering in her eyes.  &#34;Samuel&#39;s game came with a built-in virus. Lucky for me,I ran into Four-Eyes-he helped me clean it out. I&#39;m guessing Samuel and Four-Eyes are deep in conversation about how that whole thing went down right about now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was almost sure now-Samuel had started growing suspicious. The whole meeting today was probably just to confirm his hunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that just showed he wasn&#39;t easy to fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Four-Eyes,&#34; she thought, &#34;but I had no choice but to use you as cover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded lightly. &#34;What&#39;s his name again? Didn&#39;t you guys go to school together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked innocently. &#34;Barely. I left for France for an exchange program not long after we met. So.I actually never got his name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four-Eyes:[Guess I&#39;m just Nameless Extra #1.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way, Rachel, I&#39;m heading to the hospital to see Grandpa. After that, I&#39;ll meet up with Tristan.There&#39;s a charity auction tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s eyes lit up like fireworks. &#34;I&#39;m coming with!Pick me up later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it and literally bolted off toward the Vuijing Bay villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a tiny laugh,helpless but amused, then started the car and headed for Capital Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up a bouquet of lilies before going up to Room 1123 in the neurology department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Bernard saw her, he said, &#34;You were here a few days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart soared-he remembered her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing his hand gently, she leaned in. &#34;Grandpa, you recognize me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, thinking carefully. &#34;You&#39;re... you&#39;re Megan,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Grandpa. It&#39;s me. You remembered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bernard frowned slightly, his brows knitting together as he stared at her like trying to pull something from memory. &#34;I feel like. there&#39;s something really important I need to tell you. But I can&#39;t quite grab onto it... What was it.?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his temple with frustration. &#34;It&#39;s just not coming to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lightly patted his hand. &#34;It&#39;s okay, don&#39;t stress over it. Grandpa, the world&#39;s top neurosurgeon will be here in mid-September. He&#39;ll fix you up. You&#39;ll be just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bernard gave a tiny nod. &#34;I&#39;ve got a headache.I want to sleep a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan, worried he might have another seizure like last time, gently helped him lie down and tucked the blanket around him. &#34;Alright, get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the old man with silver hair had drifted off peacefully  The male aide stepped in quietly. &#34;Miss Shaw, as soon as you left last time, the other Miss Shaw showed up.The one with the bad temper-nothing like you. I&#39;ll go get some hot water. You stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a small nod and waited until he&#39;d fully stepped out before swiftly pulling a tiny device out of her handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a white, barely noticeable micro surveillance camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only five millimeters in size, but with amazing storage and full-angle coverage-it was known as a &#34;mosquito cam&#34; for a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped carefully onto a chair and fixed it onto the wall,right above the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the door creaked open behind her.</p>
