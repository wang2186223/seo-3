                <p>Megan stood in front of the factory, the place swallowed in darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes, just as two tall figures stepped into the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nasty grins and crass laughter, the two men swaggered toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hot damn, look at this chick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bet she feels amazing to touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as their hands reached out toward her, Megan struck-her high heel slammed right into one guy&#39;s crotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other one went for his gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grabbed his wrist, twisted it downward-&#34;crack!&#34;-his arm dislocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gun dropped to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flick of her toe sent the weapon flipping into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jammed the barrel straight into the guy&#39;s mouth and turned to the other, now on his knees.Her voice was like ice. &#34;How many people inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch!&#34; the man spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a flinch, Megan yanked the barrel out and shoved it into the second man&#39;s mouth. Slight angle,pull the trigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood sprayed into the wet dirt, already dull and lifeless underfoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silencer muffled the shot, but the man&#39;s screams said enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly shot through his arms and legs, leaving him crumpled on the ground, writhing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to the guy still standing,pressing the steaming muzzle against his temple.&#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shivered violently. &#34;Just... hostages and that crazy woman, plus ten-twelve more guys. Please,we were hired, that&#39;s all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;Hired? You two? You&#39;re not with the rest of them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy shook his head like mad. &#34;No, no! She&#39;s the one who paid us-to, uh, do that to the girl. We don&#39;t even know the others-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bullet ripped through his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body folded backward like a broken puppet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s head snapped toward the sound. She caught a flicker of movement-someone ducking behind an old, rusted car. A sniper. That guy had been there all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they&#39;d wanted her dead, she&#39;d be lying cold already. Who&#39;s behind this twisted game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed. Megan answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A distorted voice came on, almost giggling. &#34;Tsk tsk,you&#39;re toosoft-hearted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s grip on the phone tightened. &#34;Who the hell are you? Did you take Molly and Wyatt ? Are you using Molly to come at me? What are you even trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter spilled through the speaker. &#34;Four questions right off the bat, impressive. But I&#39;ll answer only the last one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s tongue ran across her back teeth. Yep, this one was just screwing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw twitched. &#34;Screw off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More laughter. &#34;Oh, don&#39;t worry. Got a nice gift coming your way.&#34; She hung up and stepped over the body, entering the factory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she crossed the threshold, the lights snapped on with a blinding glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sat comfortably on a worn leather chair,acting like she owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twelve men in suits stood behind her, bult like tanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just above them, Chloe hung in the air, wrists bound,mouth gagged with a cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch, drop the gun. Get on your knees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes were venomous,filled with hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Megan didn&#39;t move, she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yelled at one of the suited men, and Chloe was hoisted another meter higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was dangling like three stories up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said get down, or I&#39;ll lift her till she drops and  dies!&#34;Megan looked up at Chloe,who was shaking her head frantically, tears gushing down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a faint smile, tossed her gun forward,and dropped to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly let out a crazed laugh, quickly getting to her feet and striding straight toward Megan with an impatient look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got close, the manic grin grew on her face.Standing over Megan, she raised her foot and aimed to kick her in the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan reacted fast-she grabbed Molly&#39;s leg and twisted it hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scream, Molly crashed to the floor sideways,her voice echoing through the empty warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan yanked her up by the hair, forcing Molly&#39;s head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled a handgun from the inside of her thigh and pressed it against the back of Molly&#39;s skull,hoisting her up as a shield. Using Molly as cover, Megan fixed her eyes on the suited men who had drawn their weapons. &#34;Let the girl go. Or I shoot her right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the suited men picked up a call and put it on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A distorted voice chuckled mockingly, &#34;Go ahead.Pull the trigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly screamed in panic. &#34;No, wait! You still need me!I don&#39;t wanna die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the phone added, &#34;Megan, this won&#39;t be our last meeting. Keep my last answer in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The armed men slowly backed off, pocketing their weapons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift kick, Megan sent Molly sprawling face-first into the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, rapid gunfire erupted outside the warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan immediately thought-Tristan must be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched down and gave Molly a sharp chop to  the neck, knocking her out cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed over to the ropes holding Chloe,loosening them bit by bit and untying the restraints around her wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ropes had left angry red marks on Chloe&#39;s wrists, the skin barely hanging on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been strung up for too long, gagged and struggling to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Megan pulled the cloth from Chloe&#39;s mouth,she gasped for air like a fish out of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, breaking into sobs, Chloe flung herself into Megan&#39;s arms. &#34;Meg, I told you not to come! What if something happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s mind flashed back to the brutal photos she&#39;d seen in her past life-Chloe&#39;s mangled body.That kind of end? Not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently stroked Chloe&#39;s cheek. &#34;Be good. Stay here-I need to go check outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan frowned. &#34;No. You stay put and watch Molly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the pistol she&#39;d tossed earlier,handed it to Chloe, and pulled the safety. &#34;Take this. If she so much as twitches,shoot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Megan got up and bolted out of the warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of bullets tearing through metal rang in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan ducked behind an old pickup truck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t call Tristan. If he got distracted, he might get killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nova Tech, take me to your master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova peeked out from under her skirt. &#34;But Master said Nova&#39;s job is to keep Little Fairy safe, not bring you into dangerous places.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move it or I&#39;m blasting you into scrap right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova flapped her metal wings, lifted off, circled twice overhead, and finally flew east.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stayed low, running in the direction Nova flew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gunfire suddenly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched behind a battered Volkswagen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick and still. A strong metallic scent of blood floated in, hitting Megan&#39;s nose and turning her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned around carefully, the only sound her own breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took one slow step back-and suddenly froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cold and round was pressing hard into her lower back.</p>
