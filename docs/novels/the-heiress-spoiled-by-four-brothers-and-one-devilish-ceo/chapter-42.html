                <p>The locker room door was kicked open with a bang, slamming into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the group was a greasy-looking middle-aged man who had to be over two hundred pounds,flanked by a bunch of thugs, all looking ready to throw down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second he spotted the man sitting casually on the bench, that fierce look on his face disappeared like magic, replaced by a fawning grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t Mr. Reid?&#34; he sneered at Daniel lying on the floor. &#34;No idea what this loserdid to tick you off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan calmly pulled a wet wipe from his pocket and wiped his fingers one by one, slow and methodical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, done withhis little cleanup ritual, he got to his feet. &#34;Daniel&#39;s coming with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor Hayes bared his stained teeth in a forced grin. &#34;You know I&#39;m running this whole underground ring on that guy,right? Without him, business is gonna tank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a sudden smile-cold and sharp. &#34;No one bargains with me.Ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s eyes darted around as he smirked slyly. &#34;But imagine this-word gets out that the famous Tristan died in my ring. Don&#39;t you think &#39;Victor Hayes&#39; would be the name on everyone&#39;s lips?&#34; He let out a cocky laugh-until he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep dreaming,&#34; Megan snapped, whipping a little device out of her pocket and tossing it toward the guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech arched through the air, tail glowing. A series of thin steel needles shot out mid-flight, piercing straight into Victor&#39;s open mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter died in an instant. Clutching at his throat, mouth gushing blood, he collapsed backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech landed neatly and scurried back, pawing at Megan&#39;s pants leg. &#34;Nova&#39;s scared! That ugly dude almost made me barf! Hug hug!&#34; Megan knelt and scooped the littlebot up, then casually hurled it back toward the thugs behind Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thugs shrank back, shielding their faces, but nothing came at them. Nova Tech simply dropped two shiny little metal pellets during its landing and zipped back to Megan&#39;s side for comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no danger, the goons let down their guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bad move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pellets exploded into spinning rings of razor-thin blades that zipped around their ankles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screams erupted as the tough guys dropped like dominoes, clutching their legs and howling in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan grabbed Nova Tech.&#34;Nice job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two tiny red hearts lit up in its eyes. &#34;Master is the best, the most handsome!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rolled her eyes and stuffed it back in her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when one of the thugs pulled a gun and aimed it at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Tristan stepped in front of Megan and fired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the side window shattered-followed by that unmistakable splat of bullet hitting flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Headshot.Twice.One to the temple, one between the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy dropped instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, a squad of armed operatives in full tactical gear stormed in, guns raised, securing the room and surrounding the fallen men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grabbed Tristan, checking him over. Her nose stung, heart thumping as she threw herself into hi arms. &#34;You idiot, why&#39;d you take the bullet for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently pulled her close, fingertips brushing through her hair. &#34;It&#39;s my job to keep you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook her head furiously. &#34;No. I want to protect you too.&#34; She looked up at him, her voice soft but steady. &#34;You could&#39;ve just walked in and taken him out, couldn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d get this bad,&#34; she muttered with a frown. &#34;They actually had guns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze was warm, indulgent. &#34;Well, you wanted to see how we do things, right? It&#39;d be no fun just handing the guy over to you. You needed a little taste of the real thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted. &#34;Great. Guess I really am the drama.&#34;Tristan noticed Megan&#39;s eyes were getting red, and he pulled her into his arms, holding her tight. &#34;Of course not. You&#39;re everything to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,everyone, including Daniel, was taken out of the locker room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan asked with curiosity, &#34;Who was that sniper? That shot was solid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave a sly grin, eyeing a leg stepping into the room, and quipped, &#34;Cameron, Ice Cam!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leg instantly retracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron wiped his face, feeling seriously attacked. Dang, that hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did she roast him with a nickname, she practically joked about the boss&#39;s life. If his hand had slipped just a little today, one of those thugs could&#39;ve shot Tristan to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Prestige Club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel had been relocated to an underground room. Max treated and bandaged his gunshot wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once done,Daniel reached out to the number he was instructed to call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to hear my daughter&#39;s voice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice altered by a modulator came through. &#34;And what if you do? Follow instructions and you might see her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel snapped, &#34;How do I know you haven&#39;t hurt her?&#34; The voice responded, &#34;Fine,hear for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy... Daddy... help me...&#34; Little Myra&#39;s crying voice cracked through the line, and Daniel&#39;s eyes turned red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t hurt her. I&#39;ll do whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mess up, and you can bury her yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan sat across from Kevin. Tristan asked, &#34;Any news?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dracopower was a key telecom partner, with access to sensitive data-including SkyEye surveillance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin nodded, &#34;An abandoned steel plant on the west side of the capital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan turned to Cameron. &#34;Get the girl out safely. And bring back whoever made that call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Cameron responded right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going with you,&#34; Kevin added before heading out with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Tristan stood and gently pulled Megan to her feet, wrapping an arm around her waist. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the exit, Tristan looked back at Daniel and said, &#34;We&#39;ll bring your daughter here so you can see her first. She&#39;ll be taken to the hospital after that. And keep in mind- the guy who called might not be the one pulling the strings. So when you&#39;re locked up with him, don&#39;t go overboard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basically, beat him up if you must, but don&#39;t kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel gave a short nod. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan entered another basement room. A skinny man sat in the corner fast asleep, hugging a laptop bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As footsteps approached, he jerked awake and scanned the two with panic in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.you&#39;re Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair flooded his face. &#34;Why me? Why&#39;d I have to piss off the nightmare boss himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan flopped onto the sofa. He leaned back lazily with one leg casually crossed over the other,tapping his fingers on the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was just about to hop a flight to Thailand when my guys caught him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rubbed her chin, blinking with interest. &#34;Trying to flee. or maybe go full ladyboy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan smirked, &#34;Don&#39;t tempt me. That&#39;s actually an idea- snip him, send him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man shook his head like mad. &#34;No, no,please! Have mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk on your own, or we&#39;ll make you.&#34;</p>
