                <p>The moment he heard a massive third wheel was planning to tag along, Tristan&#39;s face turned stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whipped out his phone and called Kai. &#34;Your girl wants to hit up the charity auction tonight. You&#39;re picking her up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he hung up, a grin tugged at his lips. &#34;Perfect.No one&#39;s in our way now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked. &#34;.As a husband, you&#39;re amazing. As a brother, you&#39;re seriously shady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charity auction was being held at the Capital Convention Center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red, freshly laid carpet stretched from the entrance all the way to the front doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On both sides, behind barricades, were reporters and fans waiting eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight&#39;s guest list was packed with political big shots and entertainment A-listers, so the vibe was pure star -studded glam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleek luxury cars pulled up one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men were dapper in tailored suits, the women elegant and stunning like they&#39;d walked out of a fashion magazine.  Then a Maybach with the license ending in 888 rolled up, and suddenly all cameras turned to focus on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door opened, a pair of polished, custom-made leather shoes hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stepped out looking sharp in his suit, walked around the front of the car, and opened the passenger door. One hand gripped the frame, the other reached inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A delicate, fair hand landed in his palm, and he gently helped Megan out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped an arm around her slim waist and, as they circled around the front, tossed the car keys to Cameron,who instantly turned valet and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple&#39;s entrance turned heads instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s skin was porcelain smooth, and the soft purple evening gown elevated her grace to another level. The off-shoulder neckline hinted at her elegant collarbones, while her silky black hair tumbled down her back-she looked like she&#39;d stepped out of a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters from both sides started firing questions:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reid, you never bring a date-are you officially announcing your relationship tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reid, do you still remember the heiress of the Shaw family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan paused mid-step, turned to the reporter, and smiled. &#34;That&#39;s me-Megan Shaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter looked stunned. The Shaw heiress  seemed even more radiant than the rumors. &#34;But wasn&#39;t there talk of a runaway bride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled. &#34;Only a fool would ditch a tall, rich,hot husband. Why would I run from that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan raised an eyebrow. Wasn&#39;t that basically what you did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her answer clearly pleased him. He pulled her closer and declared, &#34;We&#39;re already married. From now on, she&#39;s officially Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flash of cameras lit them up like a movie premiere. And just like that, they were trending everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the venue&#39;s door, another car pulled up to the red carpet. Out stepped Jason Lewis,idol-level handsome in an all-white suit,exuding fairy-tale prince energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With sculpted features and sharp lines, every bit of him seemed like he&#39;d walked off a dreamboard of teenage fantasies.The single diamond stud on his left ear gave off a bit of a wild vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head slightly, nodding to fans on both sides as he greeted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay, love you guys too...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll support you forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the deafening screams behind her, Megan glanced back. &#34;Oh wow, isn&#39;t that Jason, the movie  king himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice came casually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan answered without thinking, &#34;Yeah, he looks good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gave her a quick pinch on the waist.&#34;Eyes on me only!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pouted. &#34;I wasn&#39;t done! He&#39;s handsome, sure-just a bit too pretty-boy for my taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason had been walking by fast, but those words floated right into his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that woman just call him *too pretty*?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mentally jotted down a note. She&#39;s on his blacklist now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sped up and brushed past them without a glance,but faintly heard Megan&#39;s soft, sweet voice trail behind him-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody&#39;s better looking than my hubby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason really wanted to look back and see who this blind chick was, daring to say he wasn&#39;t as attractive as Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his pride kept him facing forward, worried that hearing another comment would ruin his whole night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The convention center was split into the main hall,second floor, and third floor. The second and third floors had private rooms,reserved for VIP guests-top officials, business tycoons,elite families, the works.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan were escorted into the first suite on the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rooms on those two levels had tinted, one-way glass windows-people outside couldn&#39;t see who was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a smart setup to protect bidders&#39; privacy and avoid identity leaks that could drive up auction prices on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as they stepped into the suite, someone had managed to catch a glimpse of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charity auction officially kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayne, the top-tier host, walked onstage in a sharp silver-grey suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, esteemed guests and kind hearts.We&#39;re truly grateful to have so many generous,influential people here contributing to philanthropic causes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the money raised tonight will go to the Angel Charity Foundation,aimed at helping special-needs groups,children with disabilities, building schools, and supporting public service projects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A round of applause thundered through the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayne went on, &#34;Now, let&#39;s welcome the staff to present tonight&#39;s first auction item-a pair of custom ebony canes with gold inlays and engraved lion heads.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staff stepped forward, carefully bringing in a tray that held the canes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayne took over, smoothly giving a detailed run-down -what they were made of, their unique design, and which master craftsman designed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan rubbed her chin thoughtfully. &#34;This cane set&#39;s kinda perfect for your grandpa&#39;s birthday. Since it&#39;s a pair, how about giving the other one to Uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Tristan sideways. &#34;You brought me here just to pick out gifts, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man just smiled without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stage, Jayne announced, &#34;Starting bid is 100thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished, voices started calling out prices-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;120 thousand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;150 thousand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;200 thousand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;430 thousand! Once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;430 thousand! Twice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tristan leaned over and pressed the communication button on the table (if he didn&#39;t, their room wouldn&#39;t be heard outside) and said, &#34;800thousand.&#34; &#34;800 thousand! Once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;800 thousand! Twice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;800 thousand! Sold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congrats to the generous bidder from Room 1 on the third floor for their contribution to charity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd downstairs started buzzing, trying to guess who shelled out millions on a pair of canes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayne moved on to the next item-a pair of Brazilian pink star diamond earrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan snagged those too-for 3.8 million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third, the fourth... basically, anything that looked remotely pretty, he bid on and won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan frowned a bit. &#34;Babe, you just spent, what,five or six billion in like no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gently played with her fair fingers. &#34;Money I make is money for my wife to spend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up. &#34;Bro, ease up with the bidding! Don&#39;t you know Kai&#39;s broke now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled. &#34;HHuh... actually, I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Room 3 on the second floor, Kai was scowling. He spoke in a low voice, &#34;Rachel, are you seriously underestimating me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked innocently. &#34;Nooo, just thought I&#39;d help you save some cash!&#34;  Kai narrowed his eyes, pulled her into his arms. &#34;Honey,if you want it, I&#39;ll get it. I&#39;ve got money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked up at him, eyes shining with admiration.&#34;Kai, you&#39;re so cool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended up winning every item after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel couldn&#39;t help wondering-how was he affording all this? The drama with the Lee family basically had all his cards frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai sipped his tea slowly and said, &#34;Prestige Club&#39;s annual profit is 300 million.yeah, don&#39;t worry about my spending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel tilted her head thoughtfully. &#34;We&#39;re almost at 200 million just tonight. You, Tristan, and Kevin are splitting the profits, right? Seems like your share&#39;s running low... Unless you&#39;re taking out a loan? You know the interest&#39;s insane. Or are you getting into sketchy loans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai bent down, bit her lip, and gritted his teeth, &#34;Zip it!That&#39;s none of your business. I&#39;m borrowing from next year&#39;s profits! Worst case, I owe Tristan a few million first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel pouted. &#34;It&#39;s fine, we don&#39;t have to pay him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan:[Read my lips-leave!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Jayne gestured for the staff to bring in the ninth item-Heart of the Ocean.</p>
