                <p>The spacious room was dead silent as Amelia stared at the strand of hair between her fingers, a sly smnile curling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-click. The door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped around, the smile frozen mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O-Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver stepped in. His sharp jawline and straight nose gave off a composed elegance, but under that calm exterior, there was always a trace of sharpness that made people wary. He casually hung his suit jacket on the coat rack, his eyes cool and examining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing in here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia took a breath, trying to steady herself before forcing a calm face. &#34;The competition&#39;s tomorrow. I just remembered I left a decoration piece at home.I thought you&#39;d be around, so l popped in to say hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s expression darkened instantly. &#34;Mrs. Clark told me you stopped by-and asked if we were at home together. You clearly knew I wasn&#39;t here. Why sneak into my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step forward. Amelia could feel a chill climb up her spine, sweat starting to bead at her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s in your hand?&#34; he asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She casually let the hair slip through her fingers and fall to the floor like it meant nothing. With a seemingly innocent smile, she brought both her hands to the front and opened her palms to show to him,letting him check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver&#39;s gaze stayed skeptical. &#34;Leave. And don&#39;t ever come into my room again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face dropped, as if genuinely hurt. &#34;Got it.Oliver.&#34; As she walked past him with her head down, his voice turned colder: &#34;Don&#39;t play games behind the Lewis family&#39;s back. What&#39;s not yours will never be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked around. The bed-it had clearly been disturbed. He went over to where she was standing earlier. Nothing there. Maybe he was just overthinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, he walked out and headed to the study for a video meeting-completely unaware of the lone hair strand still lying quietly on the gray carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her room, Amelia leaned against the door and then slowly slid to the floor, hands slightly trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No rush. There&#39;ll be another chance to get a clean sample tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After packing a few accessories, she left the Lewis estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Dreamscape Manor, Tristan was in a video meeting when his phone buzzed. He picked up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron&#39;s voice came through, &#34;Boss, Samuel went to Capital Hospital. Had Director Kyan Hall run a hair sample test. Amelia also showed up later dressed as a nurse, went into the lab but didn&#39;t stay long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan rubbed his chin. &#34;What were the results?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron answered, &#34;The two samples came back with no blood relation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did we confirm whose samples they tested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, but it&#39;s pretty clear Amelia swapped hers in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s tone stayed relaxed, &#34;The Lewis family&#39;s been trying to find their real daughter for years.Hundreds of attempts, all dead ends. Wouldn&#39;t be shocked if the real one slipped through ages ago.That imposter clearly hasn&#39;t been sitting idle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron asked, &#34;What about the sample switch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan twirled the pen in his hand. &#34;Leave it for now. Let&#39;s see what happens tomorrow night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan lazily rolled over and snuggled close into the man&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pressed a kiss to the crown of her head.&#34;Babe, didn&#39;t you say someone&#39;s coming over today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes snapped open and she suddenly sat upright. &#34;What time is it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the watch on the nightstand. &#34;Nine twenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaped out of bed, dashed to the bathroom to wash up, and reappeared minutes later in a crisp shirt,jeans, and peach-red flats, bounding out of the walk-in closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Tristan stood at the door in a clean white casual outfit. &#34;You going too?&#34; he asked.Tristan pulled Megan into his arms, his warm hand sliding under her shirt, lazily caressing her smooth waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked, &#34;You went to the airport yourself to get a friend, of course l&#39;ve gotta meet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s heart skipped a beat. If Mia slipped up and said the wrong thing, that&#39;d be bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she zoned out, the hand on her waist gave a firmer squeeze. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me... it&#39;s a guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a little snort. &#34;So what if it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned in, nibbling at her ear with a grin.&#34;Then I guess I&#39;ll just have to teach you a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure you&#39;ve got what it takes to tame me tonight?&#34; Megan shot back, fingers working to undo one of her shell buttons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another. And another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes darkened. He quickly buttoned them back up and cleared his throat. &#34;Uh... we&#39;re gonna be late picking up your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan arched a brow at him. &#34;Wow, Tristan. Acting like a noble gentleman now? Meanwhile, I look like a total flirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chuckled, driving her to the Capital City Airport himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Megan didn&#39;t let him tag along inside-he was too tall, too good-looking. Way too noticeable. She slipped on the newest LX sunglasses, grabbed her bag, and got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those shades covered half her face-celeb must-have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,a curvy woman with loose waves came walking out, pulling a suitcase behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she spotted Megan, she rushed over and hugged her tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My queen! I&#39;ve been losing sleep these past six months without you!&#34; Megan patted her back. &#34;Drama queen. You got all the stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia gave her chest a confident tap. &#34;Relax, I came fully loaded. We&#39;re gonna kill it tonight. But seriously,you need to catch up on the autumn-winter line.While you vanished, I was here trying to copy your designs just to hold the line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan walked alongside her. &#34;I got married. To Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say he was a nutjob?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s actually wonderfuI,&#34; Megan said seriously. &#34;He doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m Lila Moore though, so don&#39;t blow it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia looked shocked. &#34;Why not tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled softly. &#34;I want to stand beside him,not behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia looked at her like a fangirl. &#34;Classic queen move.Never a man&#39;s shadow.&#34; As they stepped out of the airport, Mia spotted a guy in a face mask and cap leaning coolly against the car,hands in pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. My. God. That&#39;s just... unfair levels of handsome.&#34; Mia pretended to wipe drool. &#34;You were outta your mind not marrying him sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sighed, &#34;Trust me, I know. I was blind as a bat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man spotted Megan and smiled beneath his mask,walking over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Mia, dedicated tailor for designer LiMo,&#34;Megan said,making introductions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia gave a polite nod. &#34;Nice to meet you, Mr.Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan blinked, then chuckled. &#34;So that&#39;s why Megan hasn&#39;t been buried in sketches lately-she had someone to handle it for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia glanced at Megan and laughed awkwardly.&#34;She does the drawings-I just help when I can.&#34; Tristan tugged Megan into his arms. &#34;Looks like my girl and LiMo are super close, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s scalp tingled all of a sudden. Did he figure it out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Mia and asked casually, &#34;So...LiMo&#39;s a guy,or...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one&#39;s ever actually seen Lila Moore, so there&#39;s always been speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay-that was definitely jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan breathed easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s eyes sparkled with mischief. &#34;Oh, definitely a man.&#34;</p>
