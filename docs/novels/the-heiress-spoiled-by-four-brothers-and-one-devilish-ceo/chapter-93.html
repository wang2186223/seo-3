                <p>The once-bright moon was now hidden behind thick clouds, castng a heavy, suffocating gloom over the capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Megan hurried out of the convention center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach idled at the curb, where Mr.Brown stepped out and opened the door with a respectful nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Megan was about to get in, Tristan slid his arm around her waist, pulled her close, and kissed her passionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, voice low next to her ear. &#34;There&#39;s a secret compartment under the front passenger seat.Full of different handguns. I&#39;ll show you how to use them now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan met his gaze, calm and steady. &#34;I already know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught him off guard. The woman in his arms grew more mysterious by the second-like a puzzle he desperately wanted to solve, piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin tugged at the corner of his mouth. &#34;When did you pick that up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two years ago. I joined a shooting club,&#34; Megan said smoothly, without a flicker of hesitation. &#34;What about you? When did you learn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you started showing up in my dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned red in an instant. That line had another meaning she couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lightly punched his firm chest. &#34;Can you not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t promise that. But I never miss. Dead-on, every time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shot him a side-eye at the shameless comeback. &#34;Cut the nonsense-I&#39;m getting in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be right behind you.&#34; As she got into the Maybach, Tristan headed for the Bentley Cameron had brought around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both merged swiftly into traffic, fading into the rush of night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan suddenly felt her passenger seat vibrating.Glancing over, she picked up her phone. An unfamiliar number lit up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on the recorder, she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A distorted, robotic voice came through the line.&#34;Lose the car tailing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not important. All you need to know is you&#39;re completely under my control now. New address-abandoned lot out east. Come alone, or you&#39;ll be picking up what&#39;s left of Chloe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click. The call ended. No doubt now-someone had eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s heart tightened. She couldn&#39;t risk Chloe&#39;s life. Not for anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two black cars drove about two hundred meters apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan dialed Tristan&#39;s number. &#34;Hey babe, how about a little race? Let&#39;s see who&#39;s faster on this stretch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, his voice relaxed through his earpiece,chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both cars took off down the highway like twin shadows,neck and neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-out of nowhere-Megan took a sharp right at an exit ramp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice, now anxious, spilled through the speaker. Her nose stung, tears threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the emotional type. Not after everything she&#39;d been through in her last life. She&#39;d come to value this second chance at happiness. But she couldn&#39;t build her peace on someone else&#39;s blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered, thick. &#34;Tristan. no matter what happens to me, take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m flipping around right now to come get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes blurred. &#34;Love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the highway fed into a quieter back road, Megan pulled over and turned off the engine. Working fast,she took off her phone case and under the car&#39;s light, removed the tracking device hidden inside,tossing it out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like Tristan had said, she found the hidden compartment under the passenger seat-in it, a stash of high-end firearms.Glock 17, Colt M2000, SIG P229...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan picked an M9 and slid in a mag loaded with 9mm Parabellum rounds. The engine roared to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black Maybach shot out like a bullet from a gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan stared at the red dot on his phone map,but when he rushed to that location, it was already deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the steering wheel tight, he instantly realized the little troublemaker had dumped the tracker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling up an app, he tapped into his smart assistant system to locate Nova Tech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because that dumb dog was currently tucked away in Megan&#39;s purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t given it to her for fun-he&#39;d planned for moments like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the flickering red dot zipping across the map, a fire sparked in his narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, if you&#39;re in, we&#39;re in this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With smooth precision, he shifted gears, stepped hard on the gas in his custom leather shoes, and sped straight toward East Suburb&#39;s abandoned car lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Kevin was pacing furiously-he couldn&#39;t find any trace of Tristan or Megan, not even using SkyEye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No clue what tricks they pulled, but their profiles had gone completely off-grid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was getting so anxious, it looked like he might combust on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Kai&#39;s call came through-he&#39;d faintly overheard someone mention the Western abandoned lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a switch flipped, Kevin practically flew out,taking his team straight to the west side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cool night wind cut through the dusk, scattering dark clouds, and that glowing silver moon hovered like a dagger in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the East Suburb junkyard, rows of scrapped cars stood still, some stacked dangerously like they were ready to topple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan parked exactly where Molly told her-between two rows of rusting wrecks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unzipped her purse and out popped Nova Tech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In its usual baby-robot voice, it chirped, &#34;Goddess,are we, like. walking into our doom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan grabbed a roll of duct tape and secured the gun snugly against her inner thigh. With a faint smile,she replied,&#34;Scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova gave a little shake-well, more like a wiggle.&#34;Scared of what? If you&#39;re not scared, I&#39;d bea crappy excuse for a guard dog to be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan let out a chuckle. &#34;You literally are a dog. Who taught you to talk like that-cuss words and all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zeta Prime did!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer shot out instantly-no hesitation at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flicked its head lightly with her finger. &#34;Hide under my skirt for now.&#34; Nova giggled, &#34;If I get a view of my pretty human&#39;s glowing white thighs, my master&#39;s gonna scrap me for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoisted it up. &#34;Relax, I&#39;ll make sure your metal head stays attached.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her dress, she clipped Nova securely underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she pushed the car door open, a cold gust mixed with the sting of rust rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the door behind her, Megan&#39;s eyes swept the surroundings, alert as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A drone buzzed overhead, circling around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still got guts, huh? Head straight, then take a right at the first intersection, right again at the second,and another right at the first one after that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned.&#34;Seriously? That&#39;s just a full circle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha. So what if it is? If you don&#39;t play along, that little tramp gets gang-handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Molly&#39;s twisted threats, Megan had no choice but to comply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the loop, she found herself right where she&#39;d started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s voice came again. &#34;Go straight, take a left at the end-there&#39;s a warehouse. Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan clenched her teeth tight, the tension pressing hard in her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without hesitation, she darted forward.</p>
