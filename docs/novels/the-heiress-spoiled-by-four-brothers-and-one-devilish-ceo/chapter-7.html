                <p>Hearing that, a flicker of light flashed through Megan&#39;s eyes, though in her heart, she figured Tristan was probably/just testing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curved her lips into a smile and nuzzled into his firm,well-defined chest. &#34;You decide, Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked up at him in surprise, not expecting him to agree so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached out and gently stroked her soft,fragrant hair. &#34;Do you blame me for arranging your leave from school back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, this man indulged her in everything,even willing to lay down his life for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she possibly blame him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she hadn&#39;t listened to Molly&#39;s lies, thinking Tristan was twisted and dangerous, she wouldn&#39;t have run away from the wedding, wouldn&#39;t have ended up imprisoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her own fault for trusting the wrong people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reborn,she was going to make her enemies pay-but more importantly, she would love this man properly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently tapped his straight nose with her pale fingertip. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t run away, you wouldn&#39;t have needed to do all that. I was too quick to believe lies.That won&#39;t happen again. From now on, I&#39;m staying right by your side. I&#39;m not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan gripped her hand tightly, his voice deadly serious: &#34;Don&#39;t ever leave, Megan, if you left me-l&#39;d die without you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing how intense he sounded, Megan raised her other hand to cover his mouth. &#34;Relax,I won&#39;t leave.But let&#39;s deal with something more important right now-the Roasted Chicken, or you really will drop dead from hunger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a sweet smile, then turned to test the chicken&#39;s crispness with golden tongs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan lifted the sizzling roasting pan-Megan steadying it with oven mitts-as they carried the feast to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan followed with lemon-wedge garnishes in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down, tossed lemons onto the platter, then pulled his reddened fingertips toward her lips. Cool breath fluttered over his oven-kissed knuckles as she pressed his palmn to her cheek. &#34;There, the heat&#39;s banished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s chuckle vibrated against her ear. &#34;That bird&#39;s teasing us. Time to devour it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their knees bumped beneath the table as they sank into plush velvet chairs.  He ripped off a glistening herb-crusted thigh,holding it near her mouth. Juice dripped onto his thumb.&#34;Open wide, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retaliated by plucking a crackling skin shard from the breast, brushing it against his lips. &#34;Payback&#39;s delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers slick wvith rosemary oil, they fed each other-tender meat, crispy skin, laughter sticky as honey-until the platter held nothing but bones gleaming under candlelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan grabbed a napkin and gently wiped her lips.&#34;This was hands-down the best meal I&#39;ve ever had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tilted her head, a mischievous smile spreading on her face. &#34;Then I want a reward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about some shopping tomorrow,sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they weren&#39;t completely free yet, it was still a nice start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a soft, cheerful&#34;mm-hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their meal, Tristan held her hand as they strolled through the estate grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her pointing finger, a spark flashed in Tristan&#39;s eyes. &#34;That&#39;s the surprise I mentioned for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| want to see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eagerly tugged at his hand, pulling him across the lawn toward a construction site in the distance. &#34;Make sure the steps are smooth, and the railing needs to be sanded down properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older man in his sixties was giving orders to the workers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing footsteps, he turned around-and froze like he&#39;d just been struck by lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable. That little troublemaker had actually made up with the young master.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard about it from Mrs. Jones earlier but hadn&#39;t quite bought it until now.So, it was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t help suspecting-was this just another one of that drama queen&#39;s tricks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Ford gave a respectful bow. &#34;Young Master, Young Madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t even officially married yet,but Tristan had already made it a rule-everyone in the house had to call Megan &#34;Young Madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may rise,Mr.Ford.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Ford&#39;s mouth twitched. Was this girl even speaking human language?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan peeked downward and saw a sunken space carved neatly beneath the lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Tristan&#39;s hand tightly as they walked down the steps. The construction workers quietly moved aside to make room, lining both sides like an impromptu guard of honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space was empty for now-no clue what it was  supposed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? What kind of &#39;surprise&#39; needs this much work?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan looked around with a small smile tugging at his lips. &#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly scooped her into his arms, adjusted her position a bit, and said, &#34;First things first-we&#39;ve got something more urgent to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan flushed instantly, cuddling up against his chest.Was he about to do something... *not safe for work*?Her cheeks lit up with color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan carried her up the stairs toward the villa,his long legs steady and unhurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them disappear,Mr.Ford muttered under his breath, &#34;A leopard can&#39;t change its spots-watch, he&#39;ll pull some crazy stunt again..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm,dim lighting filled the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan walked Megan into the bathroom and carefully set her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up her toothbrush, squeezed out some toothpaste, and said with a grin, &#34;Let me see those pearly whites.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart melted a little. Was he really about to brush her teeth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bared her teeth and watched as he gently brushed them for her. Her whole soul was screaming *bliss overload*. &#34;Open up. Ahh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His clean, slender fingers worked the toothbrush with skill, reaching every corner. Then he handed her some rinse water and wiped the foam from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she tried to squeeze some toothpaste for him,he stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for you to lift a finger. I got this,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snatched the brush right back and squeezed the paste with a dramatic flair. &#34;C&#39;mon, open up. Fair&#39;s fair,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan just chuckled and let her do her thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he heard her say, in a soft mutter, &#34;It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve got horse teeth or something. I&#39;ll survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan straightened up from his crouch, gargled quickly, then wiped the corners of his mouth with a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he said, eyes locked on her lips, &#34;maybe you should stop talking altogether.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing a shift in his tone, Megan gave a nervous little cough. &#34;About all those things | said to you before... I take them all back, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan narrowed his eyes with a sly glint andstepped in close. She instinctively backed away until her heels hit the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He braced his arms on either side of her head,effectively caging her in. &#34;Not just what you said  before. That horse-mouth comment too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted. Ah... so he did mind that little metaphor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled awkwardly and gave in without a fight &#34;Alright, alright. I was wrong. I&#39;ll never joke about your mouth again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late,&#34; he murmured, eyes slipping to her lips again. &#34;That mouth&#39;s better used for something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34; she blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kissing.&#34;	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, his lips were already on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Tristan had never felt more content.With her in his arms, he walked them both out of the bathroom toward the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They landed on it together, sinking into its softness like falling into a dream.</p>
