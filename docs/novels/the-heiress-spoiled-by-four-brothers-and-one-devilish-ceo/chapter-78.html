                <p>The chilly breeze tugged at her curls as Amelia hurried over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got closer, her face was full of worry, breath slightly uneven. &#34;Jason, are you okay? I came as soon as I heard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason sounded nonchalant. &#34;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just a scratch.You should get back to class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of disappointment flickered in her eyes but vanished quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Megan and offered a faint smile.&#34;Alright then, I&#39;ll leave him in your care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In your care? Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s not bedridden, and it&#39;s not like he&#39;s got one foot in the grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isn&#39;t it weird that a married woman&#39;s the one &#39;taking care&#39; of another man? The thought alone made Megan uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a tight-lipped smile. &#34;Talk another minute and your brother might bleed out right in front of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she slid into Jason&#39;s van without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason burst out laughing. &#34;Wow, just say you want me  gone. That mouth of yours is lethal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia stood looking at the shut car door, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fresh exhaust from the car made her cough a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never got why all her brothers seemed to like Megan. Samuel saved her once, Oliver was curious about her, and now Jason even got hurt for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing she&#39;d already had a private investigator look into Megan&#39;s background-she really was from the Shaw family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise,she&#39;d have been gone long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia watched the van blur into traffic, eyes still on it long after it was gone, her fists clenched tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got a minute?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sweet but smug voice made Amelia turn around,her brows knitting together.&#34;You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Capital Hospital, emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason sat casually in a chair, chatting with Megan.&#34;Honestly, I feel kinda defeated right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised a brow. &#34;Because I didn&#39;t take that 600million-dollar necklace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope. Because you&#39;re not even a fan of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius almost choked on his water at that one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had he heard Jason say something so blatantly cringe.  He wiped his mouth, muttering, &#34;My bad, sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shrugged. &#34;I don&#39;t really follow celebrities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius looked skeptical. &#34;A girl your age, and you&#39;re not into any stars? That&#39;s hard to believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wiggled her ring finger with a smirk. &#34;I&#39;m married. Please, just call me Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Julius remember-right, she&#39;s Tristan&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy had it all: power, money, charm, and he looked like he walked off a magazine cover. If he ever joined showbiz, no one else would even stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius shot Jason a pitiful look-game over, buddy.She&#39;s vvery much taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot a glare his way, then turned to Megan,a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sketch-was it for the upcoming contest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, gotta hand it in to my instructor later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;We might just get a chance to work together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius looked like he&#39;d stumbled on some juicy gossip.&#34;Miss Shaw&#39;s thinking of joining the entertainment industry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you ever shut up?&#34; Jason rolled his eyes. &#34;I meant she&#39;s got what it takes to win the top spot at Verduria&#39;s annual fashion and jewelry design competition.&#34;  Julius wisely zipped it. Saying more might just land him in hot water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wasn&#39;t shocked about Jason thinking she could win-she had every intention of doing just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason was definitely something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First time they met, he tried to give her a necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second time, he helped her deal with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all felt weirdly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah-Samuel popped into her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time a guy with yellow hair tried to mess with her,Samuel had jumped in like some fairy-tale dog chasing off evil spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was Jason&#39;s turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, being overly brave runs in the Lewis family.Speak of the devil, and there he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the buzzing ER entrance, a tall figure strode in quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Jason, you actually got hurt?&#34; Samuel glanced at the doctor. &#34;Can you hurry it up?This guy&#39;s immune to anesthetics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one sentence caught Megan off guard. He&#39;s immune to anesthetics?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he&#39;s been toughing it out this whole time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he manage to stay so chill, like it wasn&#39;t even his arm being stitched up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little shaken. &#34;You okay, Mr. Lewis?&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Doesn&#39;t hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel shot him a look and muttered, &#34;Yeah, right.You&#39;re the biggest wuss about pain at home. Now you&#39;re just showing off in front of a pretty girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around them dropped a few degrees. Jason&#39;s eyes grew icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, hands still slightly trembling, snipped the last stitch. &#34;A-All done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason rolled down his shirt sleeve, clearly annoyed.&#34;Don&#39;t you have something better to do? Found Black Wing yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel let out an awkward cough. &#34;Anyway, come home for dinner tonight. Mom and Dad are back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Jason brushed past him, heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius moved fast, stepping ahead to clear the way and shield Jason from enthusiastic fans who might bump into his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SamueI looked at Megan. &#34;Want me to drop you off at school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, Jason&#39;s voice came from the doorway. &#34;Don&#39;t bother. I&#39;ll take her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I&#39;m here for my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason turned to see Tristan standing right behind him -sharp suit, taller than average, and drop-dead handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Jason had to admit, the guy had that striking look-deep eyes, strong jaw, and an effortlessly classy vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded,smiling. &#34;Thanks again for stepping in,Mr.Lewis. Didn&#39;t expect the Lewis brothers to save my wife twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was polite up front, then casually tossed in&#34;my girl&#34; like a flag planted in the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on Megan, lips curling into a smile,voice deep and smooth. &#34;C&#39;mon, Megan,let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her bag, hugging the kraft paper package close and skipped over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once close enough, Tristan wrapped an arm around her slim waist, his whole expression softening. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine!&#34; Megan beamed, glancing back over her shoulder. &#34;But Jason had it rough with no anesthesia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s eyes flickered with slight surprise before it vanished. &#34;I&#39;ve been hearing great things about your upcoming series &#39;Song of Rebirth.&#39; I think I might throw in an investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was loud and clear-he was repaying the favor in his own way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason gave him a small nod, slight smile. &#34;Working with you would be a pleasure. I look forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan pulled Megan in a little closer, smiling gently &#34;I&#39;ll send some health supplements over to the Lewis house. Really appreciate everything that happened today.&#34; Then, with Megan in his arms, he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them walk off, Julius commented, &#34;Plenty of fish in the sea, man. We can keep looking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason shot him a sideways glance and walked right past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay.guess he&#39;s pissed now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he say something wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel, knowing Julius wasn&#39;t an outsider and aware of the family&#39;s long search for the real daughter,stepped up and patted him on the shoulder. &#34;Hey,don&#39;t you think Megan kinda. looks like my mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julius froze, then suddenly lit up. &#34;Ah! So Jason&#39;s into women who look like his mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel took a long breath and gave him a top-to-bottom scan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How exactly did this guy help Jason become such a big star?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it fate or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed himn with a long, baffled look and walked off,speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet corner of the café...Amelia stared out at the departing figure through the tall window, a sly,calculating grin slowly creeping onto her lips.</p>
