                <p>Chapter of a legacy forged in passion and power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Shaw family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach pulled up out front.Elliot Shaw and Diane Hartwell hurried outside-after all, a car with the license plate ending in 888 could only belong to Tristan Reid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Diane laid eyes on Megan, tears welled up and spilled over. Etiquette forgotten, she ran over and wrapped her daughter up in a long overdue embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,sweetheart, I missed you so much! You little rascal, why didn&#39;t you come see your mom sooner?&#34; Megan hugged her back tightly. &#34;I missed you too,Mom.Really,really missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes from her past life stormed back-those gruesome photos Molly had shown her. Her parents,their throats slit, their blood soaking into the floor until it met the doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And little Chloe. first violated, then murdered, cut open in the most horrific way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when she said &#34;missed you,&#34; it wasn&#39;t just about being locked up in Dreamscape Manor. It was the aching, raw relief of knowing her family was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By her side, Tristan cast his gaze down. That&#39;s on him.He had imprisoned her back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot,smiling, nodded at Tristan. &#34;Mr. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then to Diane, he gently scolded, &#34;She&#39;s finally back.Stop crying and get inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, Diane clung to Megan&#39;s arm while they sat down on the couch. Tristan and Elliot sat in armchairs nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane squished Megan&#39;s cheeks, her smile sharp at the edges. &#34;Look at you-filling out! Must be living large at that fancy manor, huh?&#34; She pinched Megan&#39;s waist playfully. &#34;So cozy you ghosted your own mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot snorted, tugging Diane back. &#34;Pshh,lay off her!Since when you got a problem with our kid being happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan tilted her head.&#34;Let me guess. Molly told you  that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diane dabbed at her tears. &#34;Yes, Molly said that when she came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s smile chilled a degree. Typical Molly-always the master distractor, stirring the pot however she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow, sis,you and Tristan are back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s sweet voice rang out as she stepped gracefully into the room, handbag dangling on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her usual smile on and took a seat on the long couch across from Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at Molly, then at Tristan, and said to everyone: &#34;I have good news to announce. Tristan and I are legally married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Molly couldn&#39;t hide her shock. Her voice spiked a little too much for her liking, so she quickly chuckled,&#34;Oh,I mean-congrats to you both!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes drilled into Molly, cold as ice. &#34;Hey Molly,&#34;her voice was tight, &#34;did you spin some story to Mom and Dad about me? That I was living it up at Dreamscape Manor for six whole months, couldn&#39;t be bothered to see them? Is that the crap youfed them?&#34;</p>
