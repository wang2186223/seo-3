                <p>&#34;Molly, don&#39;t you hate Megan? She&#39;s humiliated you so many times!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh. but she&#39;s my sister, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister my ass! That woman&#39;s pure trouble. Let me tell you straight-I can&#39;t stand Megan or Rachel. Tonight,I&#39;m giving them something strong to knock them out,then stream their disgrace on the big screen. Let everyone see just how &#39;classy&#39; those two really are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, isn&#39;t that going a bit far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly,you&#39;re way too soft. Be too nice and people walk all over you. Here&#39;s the plan-you handle Rachel,I&#39;ll deal with Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Tristan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;tworry,I&#39;ve arranged forsomeone to distracthim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But. what if we get caught?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. If anything happens, I&#39;ll take full responsibility.It&#39;ll have nothing to do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, but be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, hearing footsteps approaching, Megan slipped behind a wall column.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Natalie sneaking off, she quietly stopped  the recording on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Molly&#39;s voice chimed in again, &#34;Ash,we don&#39;t even need to set Natalie up now. She came to me first. That idiot running into this herself means if anything goes down, it&#39;s all on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a distorted voice: &#34;Hey, is this Wing God?I need you to wipe all hotel surveillance footage at Empire Grande after 7 tonight. Do it and I&#39;ll wire you a cool million. Same spot-Pegasus Bridge No. 4tunnel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Molly launched into a dramatic performance. &#34;Natalie, don&#39;t do it! If you go after Megan and Rachel, I won&#39;t forgive you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she let out a laugh so wvild, it felt like it had been waiting for lifetimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan figured Molly must&#39;ve recorded this on her end too-probably edited out all the incriminating parts and tacked on just the final line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Molly was humming cheerfully as she headed toward Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan waited for her to leave, then stepped out from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, I&#39;m about to hit the restroom, then heading to find Rachel. Everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some guy accidentally spilled his drink on me. Suit&#39;s a mess. I&#39;m heading to the presidential suite-2606-for a quick shower. Cameron&#39;s grabbing me a change of clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem. I&#39;ll stick with Rachel. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she hung up, Megan knew there wasn&#39;t much time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, she had to find Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel was chatting with two socialites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waitress approached, topping off their wine glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Rachel took a sip, the same waitress returned.&#34;Miss Rachel, Mrs. Reid is looking for you. She asked me to take you to a guest room-she&#39;s got a surprise for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel placed her glass down and followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly smirked with satisfaction as she trailed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ended up at room 908. The waitress opened the door. &#34;Mrs. Reid&#39;s inside. You&#39;ll see the surprise when you go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel stepped through. But before she could process anything,&#34;Bang! Bang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped around. Molly and the waitress had dropped unconscious right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stood there, stretching her wrists with a smug smile, then tossed over a rope and a small white pill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit spacing out. Tie up the waitress, shove her in the closet, and make her swallow this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked, dumbfounded, but quickly got to work. Meanwhile, Megan nudged Molly&#39;s passed-out body with her foot, snorted, and hoisted her onto the bed.She dug into her bag,pulled out a tiny black pill, and forced it into Molly&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were done, they shut the lights, crept out,and hid around the corner of the hallway.Not long after, two sleazy-looking men swaggered over,grinning like creeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heard the chick inside&#39;s smoking hot-curves for days!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, I&#39;ve been locked up for six years. Been dreaming of women every damn night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha, then tonight&#39;s our lucky break. Let&#39;s not hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! Hell yeah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cackling nastily, they swiped their cards and entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rachel&#39;s confused face, Megan explained,&#34;Molly and Natalie tried to spike us and stream it live in the banquet hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The waiter was the one who tried to drug you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel blinked. &#34;Then why didn&#39;t it work on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember that little candy I gave you earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded quickly. Then it hit her-eyes lighting up.&#34;That was the antidote?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smart girl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Megan with genuine gratitude. seriously, thank you. If it hadn&#39;t been for you, I&#39;d be the one in that room. What was in that pill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan gave a sly, devilish smirk. &#34;Let&#39;s just say karma&#39;s a b*tch for Molly. The waiter&#39;s pill was just a sleeping aid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tugged Rachel&#39;s hand. &#34;Come on, it&#39;s time we paid Natalie a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan wandered through the banquet hall, looking casual, but her sharp, fox-like eyes locked onto a familiar figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was striding over eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a pale pink cocktail dress that hugged her figure, holding a glass of red wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a seemingly earnest face, she said, &#34;Megan, I&#39;ve thought it over the last couple of days. I did a lot of awful things. I know I was wrong. Do you think...maybe you could forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smiled politely. &#34;What exactly did you do wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s tone turned sheepish. &#34;Megan, I shouldn&#39;t have talked about you behind your back. And I really shouldn&#39;t have called Rachel a homewrecker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head slightly, Megan asked, &#34;So you really mean it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded solemnly. &#34;I swear,I genuinely feel bad.I sincerely want to apologize. How about we drink this  out and make peace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan chuckled. &#34;Sure. You&#39;re being so earnest. If I don&#39;t forgive you now, I&#39;d look petty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a waiter passed by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie flagged him, taking a glass of red wine and offering it to Megan. &#34;To show I mean it, I&#39;ll drink first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan watched the crimson liquid slide down Natalie&#39;s throat, cold amusement flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,Natalie...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave you the chance to back off. But since you insisted on ruining me, don&#39;t blame me for flipping the script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan raised her glass and downed it without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief spark of triumph flickered in Natalie&#39;s gaze before vanishing. &#34;Megan,would you come with me to the restroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arm in arm, they looked just like besties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one hallway corner, Megan suddenly staggered a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly reached out to support her, wearing a look of concern. &#34;Hey, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan pressed her hand to her forehead. &#34;I&#39;m feeling super thirsty... and hot. Just really out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning worry, Natalie responded, &#34;Me too..Something&#39;s off. Maybe we should lie down in a room and rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... I want to find Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curled with a sinister grin. &#34;Okay,I&#39;ll help you get to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the ninth floor, and just as they passed Room 908, moans and groans leaked through the door-vulgar, unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t hide her smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t have Kai, then Megan sure as hell wasn&#39;t going to get him either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helping Megan into Room 907, she eased her onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casually, with an air of victory, Natalie said, &#34;Megan,I&#39;ll go get you some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she turned around...</p>
