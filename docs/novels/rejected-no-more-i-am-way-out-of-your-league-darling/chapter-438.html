                <p>Natalie, having exited Daniela&#39;s office, loitered near the door, waiting for news of Daniela&#39;s sudden demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes ticked by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour crawled past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours drifted into the night, yet all remained eerily quiet within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s brow furrowed, she shot daggers at Linden with her eyes, and, her patience finally snapping like a twig, she barged back into the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, seemingly unfazed, sat reviewing new project proposals, not even looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was cool, detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scrutinized Daniela&#39;s face, still radiating health.&#34;Daniela,how are you feeling now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite well, actually. After taking the medicine, I feel much better!&#34; Daniela picked up a document beside her, signing it as she spoke. &#34;Inform Enzo in the project department that this multi-million-dollar project can proceed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frustrated &#34;Hmm,&#34; Natalie stormed out of the office. Once outside, she fixed Linden with a withering glare. &#34;Have you been playing me for a fool all this time? What exactly did you give Daniela? Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes darted around nervously. &#34;Medicine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curled into a sneer. &#34;You can&#39;t rely on men for anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned on her heel to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden reached out and grabbed her hand, his voice suddenly turning syrupy sweet. &#34;Come on. Don&#39;t be like that. You guessed it, didn&#39;t you? | didn&#39;t give Daniela a full dose. I did it for our future, for you. If I&#39;d been caught and sent to jail, you&#39;d be left high and dry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie snatched her hand away as if it had been burned. &#34;I think you&#39;ve fallen for that bitch Daniela,haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden chuckled, a sleazy sound that grated on Natalie&#39;s ears. &#34;You&#39;re cousins. Do you really need to be so mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s sneer deepened. &#34;So, what are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be angry, sweetheart. You&#39;re theone I truly care about. Trust me. I just want to play with Daniela for a while. Once I&#39;m bored, I&#39;ll definitely take care of her for you. I reduced the dosage to make her dependent on me. This drug will cloud her judgment, soften her resolve. Isn&#39;t it Elite Lux you want? By then, you can have her transfer it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Linden, searching his eyes for a hint of truth. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden smiled. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes narrowed, her mind replaying the image of Daniela she had just seen in the office. She hadn&#39;t seemed like someone whose mind was clouded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How will you prove Daniela is under your thumb?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was brimming with self-assurance. &#34;When Daniela leaves work and heads to the parking lot, I&#39;ll give you a demonstration. With the current dosage, I can control her consciousness for about a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden grinned, his grip on Natalie&#39;s hand tightening possessively. &#34;Honey, don&#39;t be jealous. You know you&#39;re the only one in my heart. It&#39;s just that all men will stray a little. You&#39;ll forgive me, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Linden&#39;s face, a face that only a mother could love as a wave of nausea washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a brittle laugh, pulled her hand free from his grasp, and strutted back towards the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Daniela left for home at 9 PM as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the underground parking lot, Natalie and Linden were already lurking outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela detected a strange, cloying fragrance in the air. Wth a flourish, Linden snapped his fingers near her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, he commanded, &#34;Daniela, stand still andbe quiet for a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden turned to Natalie, a smug grin plastered across his face. &#34;See? The drug&#39;s working, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie tilted her head, waved a hand in front of Daniela&#39;s face, and then peered intently into her eyes,calling,&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only silence answered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The underground parking lot was as quiet as a tomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s smugness intensified, and he reached for Natalie&#39;s hand. &#34;See? | told you.1-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, they both watched as Daniela blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danielalooked at them blankly, her gaze lingering on their clasped hands. &#34;Are you dating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, already battling a rising tide of disgust, had been struggling to contain her revulsion. She hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to snap out of it so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. We... It&#39;s just...&#34; Natalie was desperate to distance herself from Linden. &#34;My hands were cold, and he was just being a gentleman, warming them for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed unconcerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, however, turned to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela began to walk away, then paused and turned back to Natalie. &#34;Linden is a good man. There&#39;s no rule against colleagues dating in the company. If you truly admire each other, I support you being together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s face was about to split into a triumphant grin when Natalie quickly interjected, &#34;No. Really. There&#39;s nothing between us. I have someone I like, and it&#39;s not Linden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded knowingly, glanced at Linden with a hint of pity, and then shook her head regretfully. As Daniela&#39;s car pulled away, Linden rounded on Natalie. &#34;Natalie, what was that all about? Why didn&#39;t you acknowledge our relationship just now? Are you saying you don&#39;t plan to be with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That could explain her strange behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s patience had worn thin, stretched to its absolute limit. She almost rolled her eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to tell Linden to take a long, hard look at himself in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was daydreaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m just focusing on my career right now. I don&#39;t want my personal life to interfere with my professional development.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s face was a mask of disbelief. &#34;Natalie, if I find out you&#39;re deceiving me, I won&#39;t take it lightly.&#34;</p>
