                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t moved at all, and she even reprimanded Alexander. This sparked a flare of irritation within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considered himself a sought-after man, not one to be dismissed lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s demeanor, suggesting he was somehow desperate for her attention, was intolerable to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when she drove away from the parking lot, he couldn&#39;t help but trail behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela at the helm of a billion-dollar project,he knew staying close was his only option-if he didn&#39;t,someone else surely would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This realization was a blow to his ego. Alexander had never felt so diminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the construction site, Daniela dove into her tasks with unwavering dedication. Alexander, donning a safety helmet, remained by her side throughout the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What caught him off guard was her expertise-she  wasn&#39;t only giving orders but knew the intricacies of architecture, engineering, and market trends by heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In several respects, her expertise eclipsed his own,despite his ten years in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revelation cast Daniela in an entirely different light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He observed her,her delicate features accentuated by the helmet, exuding a sharp concentration. She even seemed to grasp the surveyor&#39;s techniques intuitively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the lunch break, Alexander walked over to her with a meal he had brought along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela, leaning into the brisk wind, was engrossed in a phone conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s ears perked as he overheard snippets of her phone conversation. &#34;Dreamscape Research Institute must quicken its steps. Our heart restoration technology already leads the world, but I need sharper,more intricate data. Let&#39;s hold off on notifying marketing-more thorough evaluations are essential before we push forward with experimental surgical initiatives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She delivered each word with a resolute and commanding air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, someone responded  submissively, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood motionless, his lunchbox dangling in his grasp, as a surge of realization overwhelmed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreamscape was the titan of tech-medical research,a behemoth reigning over the medical sector for decades, boasting over 50, 000 medical patents globally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication was clear-Dreamscape&#39;s workforce casually generated billions annually through their patents alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The researchers at Dreamscape were an elusive league,comprising the world&#39;s top ten intellects. They shunned the public eye, yet their rare appearances heralded monumental advancements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family had once ventured into the medical sector, but it proved too intricate and profound for them; their attempts amounted to nothing more than modest endeavors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, whispers had circulated throughout the global medical circles that Dreamscape had pioneered a groundbreaking technology for repairing heart damage. This innovation promised a definitive remedy for cardiac ailments, potentially eradicating congenital heart defects in patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their claim was almost unbelievable-a single pill  could restore heart function and breathe life into those who thought all hope was lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of the pill spread like wildfire, leaving the entire planet buzzing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions swirled like a storm. Who were the unseen geniuses driving this monumental force? What marvels were unfolding within their brilliant minds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned into silence, Alexander couldn&#39;t tear his gaze away from Daniela&#39;s graceful frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him that the very person he had been searching for had been right before his eyes the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made him sick-he had actuallychoose Joyce over Daniela, like a fool chasing scraps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if Alexander&#39;s chest had been ripped open,his heart left bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pivoted, her eyes narrowing on Alexander,who stood there, his face ashen and beads of sweat forming despite the sweltering heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she inquired,her voice tinged with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s response lingered in the air, his eyes distant and unfocused. Suddenly,he erupted into a fit of laughter-loud and wild,bordering on the edge of madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an intense glare, she demanded, &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter erupted even louder, tears now cascading freely down his flushed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stepped in, positioning herself between them.&#34;He&#39;s completely lost his mind, Daniela. Avoid him at all costs-it&#39;s for your safety!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred,Daniela sidestepped him, returning to her tasks with a dismissive shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s laughter was still ringing through the air when his phone vibrated. It was a call from Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Richard was puzzled by Alexander&#39;s unrestrained laughter, but he quickly grasped the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Daniela finally agreed to relinquish the construction rights?&#34; he probed,his voice laced with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Dad,&#34; Alexander responded, a hint of sardonic humor coloring his tone. &#34;Daniela&#39;s expertise is such that she can manage those projects with her eyes closed.&#34; Richard&#39;s response was a dismissive scoff. &#34;Bullshit! A partnership with us is a no-brainer. Why the fuck would she refuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laughter that escaped Alexander then was tinged with cynicism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>′′Apartnership? That&#39;s the most absurd thing l&#39;ve heard all year! Dad, do you truly understand who Daniela is?&#34; he queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s irritation was palpable as he retorted sharply,&#34;What about her? She&#39;s just Daniela. So what if she&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux? Has Elite Lux become so prosperous that it&#39;s now invincible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Alexander&#39;s laughter came to an abrupt halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his posture, he fixed his eyes on Daniela.The evening gloom cast her into a silhouette, barely discernible in the darkening horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back his attention to Richard, he said into the phone, &#34;Daniela has been immensely wealthy-far wealthier than we&#39;ve realized. She isn&#39;t just the CEO of Elite Lux; she&#39;s also the one running Dreamscape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Dreamscape, what significance did Elite Lux really hold? Perhaps to Daniela, Elite Lux was merely a minor outpost in her vast business dominion.</p>
