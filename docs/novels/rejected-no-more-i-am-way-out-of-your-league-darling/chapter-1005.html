                <p>Nikolas was not Cedric. And Hamilton&#39;s controlling nature wouldn&#39;t change overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew she had to find out just how far Nikolas might go to defy his father for Carol&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung between them before Nikolas finally spoke.&#34;My mother left us when I was very young.My father was the one who raised me and my siblings. He was always busy with McCoy Group. There was always a sense of bitterness about him-frustration and disappointment weighed him down. Life has not been easy for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words told Daniela right away that this wasn&#39;t going to be simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas continued, &#34;I was brought up knowing I&#39;d have an arranged marriage someday. Back then,marriage didn&#39;t mean much to me. I thought I&#39;d just follow whatever my father wanted. Things are different now.I&#39;m not sure what I want anymore. I&#39;m confused and I need time to figure things out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow tightened as she watched him. After a pause, she said, &#34;If you&#39;re feeling this lost, you really ought to stop chasing Carol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her words, Nikolas jerked his head up, uncertainty flickering in his eyes as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words flowed evenly from Daniela as she continued, &#34;You&#39;re not Cedric, and you&#39;re still under your father&#39;s thumb. Carol isn&#39;t me-she hasn&#39;t had to go through what I did. The two of you aren&#39;t even together yet.She&#39;s not bound to you, and you shouldn&#39;t have to torture yourself like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, Nikolas retorted, &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant. I didn&#39;t mean it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to drag the conversation out, Daniela turned and walked straight into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the door closed, she glanced back to see Nikolas standing alone beneath the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Brad had just begun to rise from his chair to check on her, but stopped as Daniela reappeared.In a casual tone, he asked, &#34;You&#39;re back already?&#34; Daniela sent him a calm, steady look, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to make Brad shift uneasily, unsettled by the quiet intensity he saw in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sharp words left Daniela&#39;s lips, yet the coldness in her gaze made the whole world seem insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, Brad simply observed as Cedric quietly offered Daniela a glass of milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow countdown continued in Brad&#39;s head. Today was the second day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol returned from the office, Daniela was still in the living room. Carol handed her the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still downstairs? | thought you&#39;d be in your room now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness filled the room, broken only by flashes of light and shadows from a horror film flickering across the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had already waved the white flag, fleeing to his room long before; the horror was simply too much for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela passed the document along to Cedric, who disappeared upstairs into his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization lit Carol&#39;s face. &#34;You were waiting for me, weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation crept into Carol&#39;s posture as she lowered her gaze.11SO1, what is it you wanted to talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I spoke with Nikolas today. After our conversation, I decided you and he just aren&#39;t right for each other, sol asked him not to come around anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acceptance flickered in Carol&#39;s eyes.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft touch, Daniela patted Carol&#39;s hand. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. One day, I&#39;ll help you find someone who truly deserves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wistful smile tugged at Carol&#39;s lips. &#34;Okay,&#34; she whispered, sadness mingling with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions about Daniela&#39;s talk with Nikolas never left Carol&#39;s mouth. For her, Daniela&#39;s judgment was enough. If Daniela didn&#39;t approve, then it wasn&#39;t meant to be. She didn&#39;t need to ask why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind a closed door, Brad guessed Daniela was telling Carol something important. Ear pressed to the wood, he tried to catch their conversation, but the only sounds were ghostly wails and crashing waves from the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeated, Brad muttered to himself, &#34;Daniela is quite a character, using horror movies to toughen the babies up before they&#39;re even born.&#34;</p>
