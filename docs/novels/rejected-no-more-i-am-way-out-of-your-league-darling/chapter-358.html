                <p>Daniela was taken by surprise as she gazed at Alexander. &#34;You&#39;re still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander inhaled deeply. Usually, with his pride, he would have walked out by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today,something was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists tightened, as if he were throwing all caution aside, unwilling to back down until he had his answer.&#34;I need you to answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela answered, &#34;I refuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nearly lost his breath. &#34;Did you ever love me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated briefly, then replied, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded, his voice cold. &#34;Alright. Daniela, I hope you never regret what you&#39;ve said today. One day,I&#39;ll make you see me in a new light, reconsider me, and you&#39;ll want me again. But by then, I&#39;ll be out of your reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Alexander walked away, his pride shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian nudged Cedric. &#34;When Alexander said Daniela had given him everything, what did she say that left him so defeated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had an inkling, but he still made his way downstairs. He called out to Alexander, &#34;What did she say to you? We didn&#39;t catch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander suspected that Cedric was purposefully trying to mock him. He narrowed his eyes. &#34;You don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander thought Cedric was more manipulative than that woman named Nina he had just encountered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised his hands in mock innocence. &#34;I don&#39;t know, and I am curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was enraged by Cedric&#39;s response. He shot Cedric a furious glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,he had told Daniela, &#34;You&#39;ve given everything for me. How am I any different from Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had replied, &#34;It&#39;s different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unseen by the others, she had mouthed, &#34;Myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has always gone above and beyond for me, but she never gave herself to me,&#34; Alexander yelled at Cedric, his frustration boiling over. &#34;She&#39;d do anything I asked, yet she wouldn&#39;t even let me hold her hand,let alone anything more personal. But you&#39;ve crossed that line with her, haven&#39;t you? So,tell me,Cedric,does it make you feel proud? Does it feel special to have what she kept from me? Well, don&#39;t get too comfortable. People change, Cedric, and mark my words-sooner or later, Daniela will realize I&#39;m the one she&#39;s truly meant to be with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s words were sharp and icy, each syllable cutting through the air like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips curved into a faint, smug smile as he replied,&#34;Oh? Is that what she let you believe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury radiated from Alexander like heat from a wildfire, his clenched fists trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final, venomous glare, he spat, &#34;The future is long-we&#39;ll see who wins in the end!&#34; Turning on his heel, he stormed off, refusing to glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the office, Lillian&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;Daniela, why on earth did you hire Nina as your secretary at Elite Lux? She&#39;s going to be hovering around you constantly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like handing Elyse a front-row seat to every move Daniela made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was calm, almost serene. &#34;To catch the big fish, you need the right patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded, though her frown lingered. &#34;Nina might look fragile, but her eyes? They&#39;re always darting around,especially when Cedric&#39;s nearby-there&#39;s a predatory gleam you can&#39;t miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded slightly. &#34;Elyse has been living comfortably off my mother&#39;s shares for years. Her daughters? They&#39;ve grown up spoiled, thinking the world owes them something. Nina might be petty, but her sister Natalie, who&#39;s abroad? She&#39;s the real one to watch.&#34; Back then, Brylee had poured her heart and soul into supporting Elyse and her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what clid she get in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cruel, tragic ending. Kátrina never tálked about the defails, but Daniela had pieced the story fogether on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lately, Katrina&#39;s been through hell-eight car accidents, six other incidents. She&#39;s been breaking down,crying, begging to see you, Daniela. Do you want to talk to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head firmily. &#34;No,not yet. Some people only realize their mistakes after they&#39;ve been broken down enough. Just make sure she stays alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a curt nod. &#34;From the looks of Katrina&#39;s recent string of disasfers, Elyse&#39;s hand in this is unmistakable. But something tells me it&#39;s not just her. Is there someone else pulling strings behind her?&#34;③</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say a word. She stood quietly by the floor-to-ceiling window, her gaze fixed on the bustling traffic below, her eyes thoughtful.</p>
