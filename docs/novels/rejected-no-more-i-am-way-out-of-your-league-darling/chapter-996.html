                <p>That day, Brad and Ethan packed up and left Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat nervously in the living room, waiting for Daniela to come outof her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve taken a huge chunk of money from them. They won&#39;t let that slide. They&#39;re my brothers,and I know how they operate. When profits are at stake, they turn cold and cruel. You&#39;re carrying twins now.Do you really want to exhaust yourself watching your back? Maybe it&#39;s better to return their money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton spoke with Daniela, Brad and Ethan were already on their way to Jules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Daniela really say all that?&#34; Jules asked. &#34;Did Daniela actually say no one in the McCoy family who&#39;s involved can escape?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a nod. &#34;She&#39;s not planning to spare anyone. You&#39;ve got power now, Jules. It&#39;s time to show her you&#39;re not to be messed with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules scoffed at the suggestion. &#34;You serious? I&#39;m swimming in money now. With this kind of wealth, she&#39;s got no leverage. Why should I even bother siding with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we&#39;re family,&#34; said Brad, his voice quick and defensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules burst out laughing. &#34;Family? That&#39;s rich. You were all sticking with Daniela just the other day.And now,because it suits you, you want me to take your side? No thanks. I&#39;m not dumb enough to let you hide behind my money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he said that, the door slammed open and his accountant rushed in. &#34;Sir! We&#39;ve got a problem.Your money has disappeared from your account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules shot up, knocking over his chair. &#34;What did you just say? Are you certain? How could that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; said the accountant, out of breath. &#34;It just vanished. No alerts. No trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules dropped back into the chair, pale and shaken. A moment later, he passed out cold. At a private hospital, Jules slowly opened his eyes and clenched his jaw. &#34;Daniela&#39;s trying to ruin us. We can&#39;t let her walk away from this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a short laugh. &#34;That&#39;s funny, considering you swore earlier it didn&#39;t concern you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan leaned back, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules sat up, his expression grim. &#34;This isn&#39;t the time to argue. If I can get that money back, I&#39;ll split it with you.Happy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth so hard they nearly cracked. &#34;That woman should never have been born.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door creaked open. A man in a black hat stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules squinted, eyeing him with suspicion. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man removed his hat with a slow hand, revealing Josh&#39;s sharp features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has to die,&#34; said Josh, his tone frigid. &#34;But we can&#39;t be reckless. We need to plan it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad furrowed his brow. &#34;And how do we even beginto plan something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan spoke next. &#34;She&#39;s not easy to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that,both Brad and Ethan hesitated. They just wanted their money back. The thought of killing her didn&#39;t sit well. They had invested in her company and were counting on her to make them a fortune. If she ended up dead, that door would close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hesitation wasn&#39;t lost on Josh. He gave a crooked smirk.′′Once she&#39;s gone, Oiscoll will be ours again.You really think money will be hard to come by? She&#39;s carrying twins. If anything happens to them,she and Cedric will fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fixed on them, unreadable and cold. &#34;You&#39;re really still betting on her? Every time she sees your faces, she&#39;ll remember who murdered her mother. Cooperate, or end up like Jules and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s jaw tightened as his hand curled into a fist. &#34;Fine. Tell us what to do. We&#39;ll do whatever you say.&#34;</p>
