                <p>Elyse felt having Daniela killed couldn&#39;t be delayed any longer. There was no time to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse headed straight to Nina&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina was not there.Instead,she found Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked past Daniela, noticing that Lillian, who was usually by her side, was not there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was even more appealing to Linden than Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Linden had been coveting Daniela for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse approached with a smile that hid her true intentions. &#34;Daniela, Nina isn&#39;t here, but perhaps I can speak with you instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked surprised. &#34;Oh? What brings you here.Aunt Elyse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her smile slowly disappeared, Elyse let out a sigh.&#34;I&#39;ve been going through a hard time lately, Daniela.Are you available tonight? I used to talk to your mother when I felt this way. Now that she&#39;s no longer here,maybe we could talk. Would that be alright?&#34; Elyse was aware of Daniela&#39;s deep commitment to her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew bringing up anything else wouldn&#39;t help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was typically distant, but mentioning Brylee might change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Aunt Elyse,&#34; Daniela answered, much to Elyse&#39;s delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl, I&#39;m so pleased. Come on, hop in the car.&#34;Elyse kindly swung open the car door for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the villa&#39;s door burst open and Cedric walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s heart raced, and she quickly helped Daniela into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could get to them, Elyse quickly told the driver,&#34;Drive! Quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric closed the gap in a few long strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled at the door handle, finding it locked. His eyes narrowed, and just as he was about to command the driver to open it, Daniela&#39;s hand covered his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside the car, Daniela looked up at him with a smile. &#34;Aunt Elyse said she&#39;s been feeling down. I&#39;ll stay with her. Please wait for me at home, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Cedric be at ease? Naturally,he was unwilling to be with Elyse alone. Daniela tightened her hold on Cedric&#39;s hand. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll retumn soon.&#34; Then, she straightened up and instructed the driver, &#34;Drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse noticed the confusion on Cedric&#39;s face,a brief and snobbish smile passing across hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Cedric known that he was unknowingly sending Daniela into another man&#39;s bedroom,he might have regretted it deeply later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought Elyse a rush of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Elyse, where are we headed?&#34; Daniela suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked down, quickly sending texts to Linden and Natalie, letting them know Daniela would be at the hotel in thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon receiving the text, Linden hurriedly took another shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly reached out to all the media outlets in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news of Elite Lux&#39;s CEO entangled in a disgraceful affair with a disgraceful man would severely damage the company&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She aimed for Daniela to lose everything by dawn,including Cedric&#39;s love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Elyse grinned at Daniela. &#34;Cedric is a high-powered CEO, yet he&#39;s quite clingy, don&#39;t you  think? Daniela, is it true that he handles all your finances? That&#39;s not ideal. We&#39;re family, so here&#39;s some sincere advice. You should control your own money. If you&#39;re too busy to manage your assets,could help. I managed your mother&#39;s finances, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was indeed true. Elyse had gained a considerable profit after Brylee&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked out the window, her expression unreadable. &#34;Really? Aunt Elyse, what do you think was going through my mother&#39;s mind before she jumped from that building? Did she leave any desires unfulfilled? Any resentments unresolved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was caught off guard by Daniela&#39;s sudden change of subject. Her face tensed up. &#34;Well, your mother was quite ill before her death. Perhaps in a way,her passing was a form of freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse wanted to steer away from this discussion.&#34;Daniela, please consider my advice about your finances. It&#39;s odd, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re a significant CEO, yet you need Cedric&#39;s permission to lend a few million to your cousin. Isn&#39;t that silly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed at the landscape zooming past, silent for a brief moment. Then, she suddenly asked, &#34;Aunt Elyse, if my mother were still here, and knowing how much she hated misdeeds, she would make sure those who had terrible things to her faced horrible consequences,wouldn&#39;t she?&#34; As she spoke, Daniela turned her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the window&#39;s reflection, with the landscape slipping away, Elyse saw a face that bore a striking resemblance to Brylee&#39;s. Her heart involuntarily skipped a beat. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed lightly. &#34;Aunt Elyse, why are you nervous? I&#39;m only kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up at the entrance of a hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse said, &#34;The coffee here is outstanding. You should try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked in with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered the hotel, Cedric made a call. Daniela glanced at the caller ID, sent a quick reply, and then silenced her phone.</p>
