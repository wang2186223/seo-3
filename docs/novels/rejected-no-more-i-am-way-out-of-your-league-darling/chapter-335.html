                <p>Daniela was always blunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips slowly turned into a smile as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze and asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on? Do you want me to regret it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not!&#34; Cedric laughed nervously. &#34;I&#39;m terrified. If you told me you still had feelings for him,I&#39;d crumble right in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small smile. &#34;I don&#39;t look back or dwell on the past. So, you can relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt a wave of relief, his grin growing. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure | always impress you, so you&#39;ll be happy with me forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t believe Cedric needed to put so much  effort into winning her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already well-known as the most handsome man in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen his sense of responsibility, his ambition in his career, and his strong character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t possessed all of that, she never would have placed her trust in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a cheerful &#34;Mm-hmm&#34; before dialing Phillips Group&#39;s PR department, directing them to reach out to all major media outlets in Olisvine and send them to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan personally went down to meet the reporters,making sure all 56 media outlets were settled in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lounge hummed with low conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this news real or fake? I got the call, and I&#39;m still in shock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be real. Haven&#39;t you noticed how Bennett Group&#39;s stock has been dropping fast? It seems they can&#39;t keep it together, so Alexander is trying something new.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, he values money more than his own dignity,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a risky move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d say Alexander is just too sure of himself. Daniela divorced him a long time ago, and with Cedric&#39;s strong, handsome presence, who would choose Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers carried on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric&#39;s car pulled up in the underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, I&#39;m craving a sandwich from the shop across the street. Could you grab one for me?&#34;Cedric asked, his voice soft, which was unusual for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a simple request, and Daniela readily agreed without hesitation.  &#34;I&#39;ll head upstairs first. My secretary has some files for me,&#34; Cedric said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, and Cedric reluctantly let go of her hand, giving it one last gentle squeeze before releasing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned and made his way upstairs without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entrance was crowded with the entire Elite Lux executive team and more than a hundred media reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the CEO&#39;s office swung open abruptly,revealing a man in a mesh top and barely-there bottoms. He turned towards Daniela, with a smile,and in a low voice, he said, &#34;Daniela, I love you.Please, give me another chance. I&#39;ll do anything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words lingered in the air, thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood rooted to the spot, unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes of light blinded him, one after another,filling  the spacious office with their harsh echoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives of Elite Lux were busy recording the scene on their phones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s scalp prickled with discomfort, the sensation of being completely exposed overwhelming him. It was as if there was nowhere to hide, his every move laid bare for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breeze swept in through the open door, lifting the already thin fabric of his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd collectively gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela arrived with the sandwich, ready to ask what was going on, but Cedric quickly covered her eyes and guided her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Daniela asked as Cedric led her,his arm wrapped around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander is in your office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s head snapped towards him in shock. &#34;What&#39;s he doing here? And with all these reporters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, guiding her towards the stairwell,pulling her close as he kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Daniela gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s trying some absurd seduction trick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s mind went blank for a second. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked confused. &#34;Seduce me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Cedric kissed her again, keeping her focused.&#34;Don&#39;t think about it. Don&#39;t ask. If you want to see, I&#39;ll wear it for you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was completely new to this and couldn&#39;t even begin to imagine it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity sparked, and she smiled. &#34;Alright, then you can wear it later. Should I buy it for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her innocent expression was warm, offering a gentle Cedric gritted his teeth, looking at her, fighting the surge of desire inside, and smiled helplessly.&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was tempted, but the situation wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do was hold her tightly, gently biting her neck. &#34;When we get home, I&#39;ll satisfy you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes glimmered as she chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric realized they couldn&#39;t linger any longer, or something would definitely happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a moment to steady himself, he led Daniela out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they stepped out, the once-bustling office had fallen completely silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was leaning against the wall, scrolling through her phone, her expression one of amusement. She looked up at them and said with a grin, &#34;Well, you two missed an unforgettable scene. Alexander,completely humiliated, changed his clothes and ran  off. The reporters were all over him, chasing him down. It was something to see. And now? It&#39;s all over Olisvine&#39;s media sites. Alexander&#39;s a nationwide sensation now. It&#39;s a huge deal, and let me tell you,he really mnade a fool of himself this time.&#34;</p>
