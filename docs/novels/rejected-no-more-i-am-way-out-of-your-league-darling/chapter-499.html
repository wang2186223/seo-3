                <p>Cedric spoke like a businessman closing a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to business, Daniela thrived effortlessly handling numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came to bluffing and negotiation, she wasn&#39;t Cedric&#39;s equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To you, it&#39;s just one child. You&#39;re willing to give up your wealth, so why refuse to have a baby with me?&#34;Cedric was cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One child could lead to two, and two could lead to even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he couldn&#39;t keep Daniela, their children surely would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain this plan would work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela mentioned it to Lillian, she looked worried. &#34;If I have a baby and something happens to me, can Cedric really raise the child alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced at Daniela, who always lost her wits around Cedric, and sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once someone had a weakness, they could never go far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was using a baby to tie Daniela to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Lillian glanced at Cedric, smiling in the kitchen, and Daniela, lost in thought, she reconsidered-it might not be so bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux hadn&#39;t welcomed a newborn in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric suddenly became obsessed with health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exercised five times a week, cut out strong flavors, took supplements, and gave up alcohol. He never smoked, but now he banned it at Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at social events, he refused to let others smoke near him, sipping soup while they toasted with drinks. Everyone was stunned. His secretary finally explained, &#34;Mr. Phillips is preparing for a baby.Phillips Group might soon have an heir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at the secretary. &#34;His wife is the one having a baby, not him. Why is he acting like he&#39;s the one getting pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, all of Olisvine knew Cedric and Daniela were trying for a baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daniela was confused. Why did everyone choose such bland meals during meetings? When she questioned them, her partners smiled and said,-&#34;Before the meal, your husband specifically told us not to urge you to drink or eat strong-flavored food since you&#39;re preparing for a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela sat speechless, the waiter arrived with warm milk. &#34;Mr. Phillips said you should drink this bèfore your meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, the entire city knew-Cedric was obsessed with having a baby. Meanwhile, Doug&#39;s face contorted with rage. &#34;Joyce,are you playing games with me? You swore Daniela and Cedric were divorcing! Now the whole city knows Daniela is expecting! Listen up, I have no interest in pregnant women!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt just as annoyed and bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had assured her Daniela liked him, so how...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Doug slapped her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze in shock. The next moment, Doug&#39;s fingers wrapped around her throat, his chilling voice seeping into her ears. &#34;Joyce, listen carefully. If you -trick me, you&#39;re dead! You have a week. Get Daniela into my bed, or you&#39;re done being my wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Doug hurled Joyce onto the floor like discarded trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething,Joyce stormed off to Alexander. She struck him hard across the face. &#34;You swore you had Daniela under control! Now she&#39;s going to have Cedric&#39;s baby! Doug set a strict deadline. If I fail to get Daniela in his bed this week, I&#39;m dead! What should | do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red fingerprints seared Alexander&#39;s cheek. His stare chilled, a flicker of lethal intent flashing as he eyed Joyce. But it vanished quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce dropped into a chair, scowling. &#34;Seems like Doug&#39;s days are numbered. Got any plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander straightened his glasses. &#34;Hasn&#39;t Natalie always craved Doug? Drug him, let him die in her bed, and no one will suspect a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes gleamed at the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched Joyce rush off, his expression turning frigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He desired Doug&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He craved Daniela too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had always been his greatest shame. Only her death could erase it forever.</p>
