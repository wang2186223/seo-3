                <p>Natalie was reluctant to share a room with Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s presence,however,changed the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to eliminate Daniela today,Natalie saw an opportunity to simplify matters by moving in immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse and Ninna discussed arrangements, Natalie&#39;s gaze remained locked on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, he had opted for a black sweater and suit pants, shedding his usual formal office demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, he seemed like a traveler at ease.which captivated Natalie completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His allure was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie resolved that she must make him hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina&#39;s firm voice broke through her thoughts.&#34;I disagree. I&#39;m not comfortable sharing my space with others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes dismissively. &#34;You might as well sleep on the couch, and we&#39;ll use your room,&#34; she said without any embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, overwhelmed by anger, quickly moved close       and struck Natalie sharply across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abruptness of the slap left both Elyse and Natalie dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out! Both of you, get out!&#34; Nina yelled, her voice quivering with fury.&#34;You&#39;rejustfreeloaders!Worthless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse attempted to fight back, Josie intervened.wielding her knife that caused Elyse to back down immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,would you really allow me and Natalie to be without a home? I&#39;m your aunt. It would look terrible for you and Elite Lux if you turned us away,&#34; Elyse said.her tone sweet yet underlying it was a clear threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,ready to step in, paused as Daniela offered a tranquil smile. &#34;It wouldn&#39;t be right to leave my aunt without a place to stay. Marco.&#34; Turning to the driver.she added, &#34;Please take my aunt to the Grand Splendor Hotel and make sure she has everything she needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela&#39;s instructions clear, Elyse&#39;s eyes gleamed with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Known as the city&#39;s most extravagant hotel, the Grand Splendor Hotel boasted only the most luxurious presidential suites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying there even for a night cost fifty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile. Daniela inquired, &#34;Aunt, does this  arrangement meet your approval?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse responded with multiple nods. expressing her satisfaction.&#34;Daniela,yourmanagementisimpeccable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they departed with Marco, Elyse cheerfully waved farewell to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once out of sight, Elyse asked in a dialect unfamiliar to the driver, &#34;When will the assassin kill Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver caught a glimpse of this exchange in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face was marked by a chilling blend of coldness and malice,her features twisted in hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention back to the road, the driver remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hotel, the receptionist announced, &#34;Welcome!Your reservation is for one month. We&#39;ll need a one million dollar deposit to proceed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flashed across Elyse&#39;s and Natalie&#39;s faces.&#34;Deposit? For what exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, the receptionist explained.&#34;It&#39;s required for your stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse retorted, &#34;But it was Daniela who sent us here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist&#39;s smile faltered as she replied,&#34;Regardless of who made the reservation, the payment remais your responsibility.&#34; &#34;Hold on,&#34; Natalie interjected. &#34;Daniela directed us here,so why are we being asked to pay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist almost lost her professional demeanor. &#34;The bill is yours to settle, not Ms. Harper&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouldn&#39;t you be able to cover your own expenses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a loss for words, Elyse stepped outside to call Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the Grand Splendor Hotel owned by you, Daniela?Why are we being charged for our stay?&#34; Elyse asked,her frustration evident after a taxing day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I pay for my stays too, so you&#39;re not an exception,Aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse exhaled slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, Aunt, you&#39;ll eventually move to the retirement home, so don&#39;t stress about the cost. You can afford this hotel, and it&#39;s important for women to indulge themselves,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That settled the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Elyse reluctantly processed the million-dollar payment, she couldn&#39;t help but regret her decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, back in their room, Natalie called Russell, her voice tight with frustration. &#34;When will Daniela be out of the picture?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like Russell was in the middle of a card game. &#34;She&#39;s still going to be around because you  haven&#39;t paid enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was exasperated. &#34;What the hell are you talking? I transferred a hundred million to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell responded distractedly, &#34;Oh, I should mention.there are fees for interbank transfers, and the currency exchange rate complicates things. Let me check... Well, you still need to give us three million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was incredulous. &#34;Is this some kind of scam?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was. But Russell didn&#39;t say that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled and reassured her, &#34;Not at all, we run a legitimate business. Send over the three million,and we&#39;ll handle Daniela immediately.&#34;</p>
