                <p>Katrina had just stepped out of the shower and was lying on the bed,plotting her next strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her choice of attire, a revealing dress, shimmered with an alluring charm in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was especially enthusiastic tonight. As soon as Caiden entered the room, she embraced him and started kissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Caiden&#39;s interest seemed to wane, his responses sluggish and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by the lure of the family fortune that dangled within reach, Katrina intensified her efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the storm unleashed its fury, mirroring the tumult inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once their encounter concluded, Katrina, breathless and flushed, nestled against Caiden&#39;s chest and murmured, &#34;Honey, what&#39;s wrong today? You&#39;re not quite yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, unfazed,reached for a cigarette and lit it, the silence thickening with the rising smoke. Katrina held her breath,watching him, and once the cigarette was spent, she attempted to recapture his attention,her seductive dress clinging to her contours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, it seems Alexander is gearing up to propose to Joyce formally,&#34; she ventured, trying to gauge his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, drawing another cigarette, responded with cold indifference,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke wreathed around his face, quickly shrouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing of her throat, Katrina sought to reclaim Caiden&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, such a signal would compel him to discard his cigarette and draw her close, enveloping her in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, however, Caiden appeared deaf to her cue. A flicker of anguish shadowed Katrina&#39;s gaze, deepening ominously before she quickly veiled it with a radiant smile, masking her true feelings. She had crucial motives today and needed Caiden on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than protest, she pressed herself against him,her fingers sketching tender patterns against his chest.&#34;Honey, consider the benefits after Joyce marries Alexander. Given the Bennett family&#39;s flourishing status, Joyce would thrive as one of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, wrapped in his own silence, gave no response as he continued to puff on his cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina continued &#34;Joyce is already pregnant. The Bennett family probably wants to seal the deal because she&#39;s the only daughter, and our family&#39;s wealth is a big safety net for her. But for some reason,Richard didn&#39;t mention it today. It seems he&#39;s waiting for our promise. What I&#39;m getting at is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused strategically, her eyes locking onto Caiden&#39;s with intentional gravity. &#34;What I&#39;m getting at is that ultimately, the family fortune will belong to Joyce. We&#39;re doing this for her future, aren&#39;t we? So,why not transfer your assets to her now?&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lingered in silence, a thin trail of smoke curling from his cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina arched up and planted a kiss on Caiden&#39;s lips.&#34;Besides, everything&#39;s been arranged,right? We won&#39;t have any more children. We might as well let Joyce solidify her standing in the Bennett family. Once Joyce is married, my only job will be to attend to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was tender, filled with the assumption that Caiden would concur. However, he remained eerily silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina nudged his arm, her voice laced with concern.&#34;Honey, what&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden murmured, &#34;I need some time to think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brows knit together in a sudden scowl, a flash of revulsion darting across her features unseen by Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lifted her gaze again, her expression had morphed into one of wary calculation. &#34;Certainly,take your time to consider. I know Joyce holds a special place in your heart, and you always prioritize her needs. But, honey, we need a swift decision. Our daughter&#39;s condition grows more apparent by the day,and if she bears a child out of wedlock and it becomes public, it would tarnish our family&#39;s reputation, don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s reply came as flat as before. &#34;Indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s displeasure deepened, puzzled by Caiden&#39;s unusual detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been gearing up for this moment all year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dedicating over a decade to serving Caiden, she was at the brink of claiming the family fortune, and errors were not an option now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was poised to press further, but Caiden abruptly snuffed out his cigarette and stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina watched his retreating figure heading towards the bathroom, her expression hardening into a frosty glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was unusually aloof, his demeanor casting a shadow over the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina pondered his changed attitude, her seldom -used backup phone tucked away in a drawer buzzed urgently. Casting a cautious glance towards the bathroom, she retrieved the phone and stepped out onto the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,why on earth are you calling so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time Katrina had encountered Brylee Harper,Daniela&#39;s mother, she had spun a tragic tale of being the sole survivor of her family, desperately seeking refuge. She had implored Brylee to take her in as a maid,claiming she had nowhere else to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That deception had carried on for over a decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Caiden didn&#39;t know Katrina&#39;s mother was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send me some money; I lost again at poker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I just hand you five hundred thousand? Mom,try to keep some for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do it quickly! And since Joyce is pregnant, take good care of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina responded with a subdued, &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? You seem off. Isn&#39;t it said that you have Caiden completely captivated? What could possibly be troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to check if anyone was behind her,finding herself alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered, &#34;I&#39;ve noticed something off about Caiden today. Normally, he&#39;s quick to agree with anything I say. But earlier, when I suggested he should pass the fortune to Joyce, he paused-a first.Why have | devoted the last decade to that old man?Clearly, it&#39;s for the money. Why else would I endure,always smiling and bending over backwards?&#34;2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gazed into the deepening night sky,her mind racing as a sudden thought struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gasp of realization, she cried out, &#34;Mom,could he possibly know about Brylee&#39;s death...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ridiculous!&#34; her mother yelled through the phone,cutting sharply through Katrina&#39;s spiraling thoughts.&#34;Brylee took her own life by jumping off that building.We will not discuss this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,subdued, nodded her head in agreement. &#34;Yes,you&#39;re right. I&#39;m just being foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she uttered the words than the door behind her emitted a haunting creak. Swiveling abruptly, Katrina&#39;s face hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glare, caught in the ghostly glow of the moonlight,carried a silent threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call with a snap and called out to the door, &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
