                <p>Joseph watched Cedric stroll over to Daniela, his tone casual as he asked, &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about Cedric&#39;s manner suggested concern, as if he might as well have been making small talk about the forecast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved in a small smile, making it obvious she wanted no trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason, completely oblivious, turned to Cedric and said, &#34;Cedric, Daniela is insane! All I did was call her pretty, and she snapped at me. Are you aware you married a lunatic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calm in Cedric&#39;s expression vanished, replaced by a sharp flash of anger. He tilted his head, pretending he hadn&#39;t caught Mason&#39;s words, but the danger in his eyes was impossible to miss. &#34;Mind repeating that for me? Go ahead. Who did you say was pretty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason froze for a moment, then said, &#34;I said Daniela was pretty. Why is that a problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching this exchange, Mason silently decided both Cedric and Daniela must be completely unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you think my wife&#39;s attractive. And then what? What more did you say? She beat you up for it?&#34; Cedric pressed, his gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason could only look at them in disbelief, feeling lost in their twisted logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Daniela, Cedric said, &#34;Honey, why don&#39;t you and Carol head home? Let me handle this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric, taking in the icy edge in his eyes, then shrugged. &#34;Forget it. Let&#39;s just go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hand into Cedric&#39;s and started toward the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason slumped to the ground, completely defeated. Joseph hurried to help Mason up, darting a wary glance at Cedric, whose eyes still glinted with a chilling intensity from his seat in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph ducked his head in terror while Mason, trembling with agony, lost consciousness. An ambulance rushed Mason to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After doctors finished mending his broken hand, a second scream tore through the hallway. His other hand had just been broken as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flat on his back and barely able to move, Mason couldn&#39;t even muster the strength to cry from the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of the incident sent shockwaves through the entire McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stood at his bedside, shaking with rage as he stared at his battered son. &#34;Mason, tell me who did this to you! I swear, I&#39;ll make them pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm tears filled Mason&#39;s eyes as he replied, &#34;Daniela and Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s anger boiled over. &#34;Daniela and Cedric! They&#39;re going to regret ever touching my boy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stepped into the room, only to find Josh practically trembled with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in the scene, Hamilton could hardly believe what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re saying Daniela broke one of his hands first and then Cedric stormed into the hospital and broke his other hand? Are you sure? That just doesn&#39;t sound like them,&#34; Hamilton said, still reeling. He&#39;d always thought of Daniela and Cedric as strategic, not the type to lash out without good reason. Launching an assault on someone in the middle of the day? That seemed unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to Joseph for answers. &#34;What really happened? Start from the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale and still shaking, Joseph stumbled over his words. &#34;Mason had too much to drink and he started bothering Daniela. He said he wanted to sleep with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was equally stunned. &#34;The guy&#39;s got guts, I&#39;ll give him that. Who&#39;d say something like that out loud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph added, &#34;Daniela didn&#39;t tell Cedric what Mason said.Mason said something,and Cedric was livid.For a second, I thought Cedric might actually kill him right there. I didn&#39;t expect him to follow Mason to the hospital afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the room, Hamilton took in Mason&#39;s limp form and the anxious faces of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was calm as he spoke. &#34;Mason crossed the line. He got drunk and mouthed off to a married woman.Her husband snapped. You&#39;re just going to have to take this one on the chin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh erupted, his anger spilling over. &#34;What is that supposed to mean, Hamilton? Daniela&#39;s perfectly fine!My son just ran his mouth a little, and now he&#39;s laid up in the hospital. You think you can just gloss over this with a few words? Does Cedric even know you&#39;re defending him? Don&#39;t forget, Hamilton, you&#39;re not in charge of McCoy Group anymore. You don&#39;t get to call the shots. Leave, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot him a cold gaze. &#34;Let&#39;s not forget. A man&#39;s going to defend his wife when she&#39;s insulted. Mason crossed the line. Who wouldn&#39;t be angry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nearly shouted, &#34;So that makes it okay to break both his hands? Since when did Daniela become some sacred figure no one&#39;s allowed to talk about? I won&#39;t accept this nonsense! I won&#39;t let this go! Cedric and Daniela are going to pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the outburst, Hamilton felt a strange sense of deja vu. A memory flickered that Daniela once told him that people only act indifferent until something happens to themselves. The day the knife was pointed at him, only then could he ask her to let ggo of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, this gas come true, just as she predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that things were only going to get messier from here.</p>
