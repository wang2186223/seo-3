                <p>Daniela had only told Brad to speak his mind. She never said she&#39;d actually agree to anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to Brad, that small gesture felt like hope, like someone had just thrown him a rope while he was drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at Daniela and spoke with quiet urgency.&#34;A while back, I invested billions into Phillips Group.I know the capital wasn&#39;t mine to begin with,but could you at least make sure the yearly returns from that investment go to my daughter, Lara? She&#39;s a good kid -smart, kind, and she&#39;s never done anything to harm you. All the blame lies with me. Daniela, she&#39;s just a young girl. Soft-hearted by nature. I can&#39;t bear the thought of my mistakes destroying her future. So I&#39;m begging you...Please, in the years ahead, make sure she gets those yearly dividends based on what l originally put in. She&#39;s all I have. I don&#39;t want her to suffer because of me. This is the only thing I ask of you,as her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at him coldly. Her voice was steady,but there was steel behind it. &#34;Now you care about your daughter&#39;s future? When you guys decided to kill my mom, did any of you care that I was just a little girl too? Alone, scared, confused? Did it even cross your mind that I might be hurting?&#34; People never really understood how much something hurt until they felt it in their own skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad broke down, tears falling as he said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry!Everything that happened... it&#39;s all because of the McCoy family!&#34; He raised his hand and smacked himself across the face hard. But the sting didn&#39;t matter to him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he wasn&#39;t a monster or a criminal-he was just a desperate dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her back to him. &#34;I&#39;ll accept your request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stood frozen, staring at the rain long after Daniela had vanished into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint laugh escaped his lips, and he whispered,&#34;Thank you,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh had just been discharged from the hospital,but instead of resting, he was wandering back and forth inside the living room, restless and anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he looked at the door,he felt like he could see Jules hanging there, blood dripping to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It ran down from his head, forming a dark red puddle.The scene was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been able to sleep properly for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted, sleep-deprived, and with heavy bags under his eyes, he picked up his phone and made a call from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell am I paying you for? You&#39;re supposed to be Oiscoll&#39;s top assassin crew, and you can&#39;t even handle Brad? The man&#39;s nearly sixty! Are you seriously telling me you can&#39;t get rid of him? If you&#39;re not up for it, just say so-I&#39;ll hire someone who actually gets things done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other side was calm, icy, and full of confidence.&#34;&#39;Let me level with you-Brad&#39;s not some easy target. He&#39;s been one step ahead of us the whole time. The guy vanished without a clue,which means he knows how to cover his tracks. But don&#39;t stress.Once the Axe Gang takes a job, we don&#39;t leave it unfinished. Just give me three more days, and you&#39;ll have his head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh felt like he might collapse. Clenching his jaw,he snapped, &#34;No! Three days is too long!&#34; At this rate, he felt like he&#39;d drop dead from exhaustion before then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked into the phone, his voice cold as ice, &#34;I&#39;ll throw in another million. Just get it done by tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was running on fumes. He just wanted one full night of decent sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person on the other end chuckled quietly. &#34;Deal.You&#39;ll hear from us with good news soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh looked up at the gloomy, gray sky and exhaled slowly. It was almost over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he had to do now was wait for Brad to die. After that, he&#39;d find a way to get rid of Daniela too. Once she was out of the picture, he could reclaim all of the McCoy family&#39;s wealth for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was finally going according to plan</p>
