                <p>Irritation surged through Nikolas, igniting his temper in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His teethclenched in frustration as he spat, &#34;What did you just say? Daniela, this is McCoy Group, not your Elite Lux! My father has acknowledged Cedric&#39;s identity, but he hasn&#39;t given the green light for Cedric&#39;s place in the group. So don&#39;t get ahead of yourself now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was like ice, sharp and cutting, &#34;What does Cedric have to do with any of this? I am arrogant because I have the strength to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury twisted Nikolas&#39; face, his anger boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of raw, seething hatred flickered in his eyes, his gaze snapping to a certain spot upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon caught the movement in Nikolas&#39; eyes and stepped forward, but Nikolas quickly reached out,yanking him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, from dozens of meters above, a gray flowerpot came crashing down toward the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes shot up. In the split second before it struck, she darted to the side, narrowly avoiding the pot.With quick reflexes, she grabbed Cedric and yanked him out of harm&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pot collided with the ground, shattering into a thousand pieces with a deafening crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned frosty, her eyes locking onto Nikolas with cold fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood unfazed, arms crossed, a smirk playing on his lips as he said, &#34;Consider this a gift to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes remained as cold as ever, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she responded, &#34;Is that so?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How generous of you, Nikolas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s car arrived just as the spectacle unfolded, the timing impeccable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard Daniela say, &#34;What a truly extraordinary gift! I&#39;ll graciously accept it. But Nikolas, do you realize this is McCoy Group? If something happened to me here, tomorrow&#39;s headlines would be explosive. Have you thought about how this might tarnish McCoy Group&#39;s reputation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already spotted Hamilton&#39;s car pulling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately raised her voice, her words oozing with sarcasm. &#34;I never imagined the future heir of the McCoy family wvould be so narrow-minded and petty. I can only wonder how much longer the McCoy family will retain its claim as the world&#39;s wealthiest family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened, his face hardening at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary, seated beside him, leaned over and whispered, &#34;Mr. McCoy, if Daniela has no interest in Cedric rejoining the McCoy family, then why is she acting this way? What does she hope to gain by provoking Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat in stillness, the silencestretching on, heavy and unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t quite unravel the mystery, the pieces refusing to fall into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he was sure of, however, was that Nikolas didn&#39;t have the sharpness to shoulder the weight of such immense responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary glanced at Hamilton&#39;s frosty expression, then at Damon standing&#39;outside, before letting out a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Carol couldn&#39;t make sense of Daniela&#39;s unpredictable behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,you said that deliberately so Hamilton could hear. But why? What&#39;s your reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s soft chuckle echoed in the air. As Cedric turned his gaze elsewhere, she responded with a calm indifference, &#34;My intention? To make sure Nikolas&#39; reputation is shattered beyond repair. I want to strip Hamilton of any desire to control Cedric. I want the McCoy family on their knees, begging Cedric to come back.I want to give Cedric the power of choice. If he returns, he&#39;ll be the most powerful figure in the McCoy family.If he chooses otherwise, I&#39;ll tear the McCoy family apart. After all, it was someone within the McCoy family who plotted my mother&#39;s death. If I can&#39;t uncover the truth, then I&#39;ll treat them all the same. I&#39;ll bring the McCoy family to ruin and wipe their legacy from Oiscoll&#39;s history.&#34; Carol stood frozen, her mind reeling at the weight of Daniela&#39;s words. &#34;Daniela, have you really lost your memories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had done so much for Cedric even though she had forgotten about their past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she not forgotten about it, Hamilton&#39;s life might have already been forfeit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a glance at Carol before saying, &#34;This is what the McCoy family owes Cedric. They must make it up to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hamilton had been nice to Cedric from the start, she might have spared him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now it was clear-Hamilton saw Cedric as nothing more than a pawn in his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she no longer saw a reason to hold back or be polite.</p>
