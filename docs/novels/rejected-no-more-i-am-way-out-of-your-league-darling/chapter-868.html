                <p>While Hamilton continued speaking, he stole a glance at the phone resting on the table. ensuring it was recording</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin crept across his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Daniela agreed to sign the divorce agreement now, it wouldn&#39;t matter if she regretted it later. Hamilton could simply play the recording for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew how fragile young couples could be when it came to trust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the smallest issue could open a crack. That crack would stretch wider until it became a wedge-something painful that neither could ignore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,it would blow up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of chaos was exactly what Hamilton hoped for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, just sign it. Once you do, everything will be perfectly handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence filled the space. Hamilton watched, eyebrows lifting slowly, as Daniela reached for the pen. She took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right in front of Hamilton, Daniela scribbled across the signature box. Big and bold, the word read-&#34;fuck off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze. He just sat there, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol burst into laughter and doubled over, holding her stomach. &#34;Do you even know who you&#39;re trying to play? That&#39;s the richest woman alive! And you thought you could outsmart her? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned cold as she flicked the pen aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; Hamilton barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t flinch. Her face was calm, her tone sharp.&#34;Should I be thanking you? You&#39;ve reminded me how popular Cedric is. Even a princess is interested in him. Sounds to me like I&#39;ve made a good pick. So tell me,why on earth would I divorce him? We&#39;re legally married. You think some foreign princess is going to snatch him from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw tensed. &#34;You were the one who filed for divorce before you came to Oiscoll! You even said you&#39;d walk away with nothing. Don&#39;t forget-if Cedric uses that agreement, you&#39;re the one left with empty hands.You won&#39;t get a cent.&#34; Daniela smiled. &#34;Exactly. So why don&#39;t you go ask Cedric to pull it out? Let&#39;s see what he decides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you speak to me like that!  Hamilton shouted,his voice shaking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood up slowly, smirking. &#34;If you think you can take me on, maybe try looking in the mirror first You&#39;re not young anymore. And you still can&#39;t see what&#39;s right in front of you? Cedric is my husband. As long as I&#39;m still standing, that won&#39;t change Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her back &#34;Carol. let&#39;s go The food&#39;s disgusting I&#39;ll have Cedric make us something edible</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she marched out of the restaurant, her defiance echoing through the hallway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clutched his chest as if something inside had cracked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned to her office She sat in silence for a long while No one could read what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol approached. Daniela, Hamilton confessed. He admitted to being behind all those shady dealings What should we do next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no answer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned closer &#34;Daniela? Still nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol bent down and saw Daniela asleep again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric returned, he saw Daniela curled up on the office couch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Carol, brows drawn together &#34;Why is she sleeping again? Did she eat anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking it through, Carol gestured toward the restaurant across the street. &#34;She grabbed a bit from McCoy Restaurant earlier, but barely touched her food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression turned cold in an instant. &#34;She ate there? With whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions came quickly, each sharper than the last</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol faltered, unsure whether to answer She hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But under his unwavering gaze, her nerves buckled. In a low voice, she confessed, &#34;It was Hamilton. He told her the princess from Loglil wanted you and demanded she divorce you. He also said if she agreed,he&#39;d tell her who was behind the murder of her mother.&#34; Cedric went still. Every muscle locked in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Hamilton admitted the McCoy family is behind Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s death?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he had long suspected it, hearing it out loud carried a weight he wasn&#39;t ready for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol instantly regretted speaking. &#34;Maybe wait until Daniela wakes up. Don&#39;t ask me anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She darted out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood alone, silent. He didn&#39;t need much. A single sentence was enough for him to put everything together</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the sky had turned a deep shade of blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stirred. She opened her eyes slowly and saw a vague silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a dim lamp lit the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked until his features came into view. It was Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake,&#34; Cedric said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded once. &#34;What time is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed her a glass of water. &#34;The day&#39;s over.&#34;  Daniela took it, sitting up slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes remained dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cedric&#39;s voice cut through the silence.&#34;You had a meal with Hamilton, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hand tightened around the glass. She hadn&#39;t planned on telling him, especially since the McCoy family was behind her mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela understood one thing clearly. If Cedric ever had to pick between her and his family, he would choose her without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t want him caught in that web.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t worth the trouble.</p>
