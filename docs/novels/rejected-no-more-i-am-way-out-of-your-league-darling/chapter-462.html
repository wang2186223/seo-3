                <p>Daniela&#39;s grin carried a hint of irony. It was cold,almost chilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping,Linden stammered, &#34;Daniela, no, Ms. Harper,I need to explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long viewed Daniela as merely a wealthy but delicate woman. Despite her assertive tactics,he thought it was her team that truly wielded the power.allowing her to achieve her goals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her team, he believed Daniela would be powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden had even entertained the thought that Daniela&#39;s disappearance would go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, in this moment, he realized his misconception. A woman who had climbed to the CEO position of a top global firm must possess significant personal strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her striking features had obscured the evident truths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Linden was driven by desire, he valued his life above all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately. Linden explained, &#34;Ms. Harper, I assure you, I had no part in this. I wanted Nina. I was clueless about why Elyse dragged you here instead. Elyse is  greedy.but I am not involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression did not waver. She idly played with a knife, her lips curving into a mysterious, subtle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Harper,wvhat are you implying? Please, I&#39;m telling the truth. Check my phone. It was Elyse,that deceitful woman, who couldn&#39;t locate Nina and substituted you because you were available. This wasn&#39;t my plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only in his underpants. Linden shivered as the cold air rushed in from the open window. Daniela had tied him to a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Harper.please can you say something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela released a chilling laugh. She gazed at Linden and whispered,&#34;Did you know? When wealthy people commit murder,someone always cleans up. It&#39;s like it never happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s face paled, his eyes wide with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elyse mentioned she couldn&#39;t find Nina,but found me instead. You were okay with that, weren&#39;t you?&#34;she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden didn&#39;t know how to defend himself this time.&#34;1...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you like to meet your end? It&#39;s your choice,&#34; Daniela murmured with a smile that was both alluring and dangerous, like a beautiful yet deadly rose, leaving Linden frozen with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you prefer falling from the 48th floor or perhaps drowning in a bathtub suits you better? Or shall we arrange an accidental electrocution? That last one&#39;s quick-over in seconds. You wouldn&#39;t feel a thing.What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s manner of listing the death options was as casual as one might discuss the day&#39;s weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking uncontrollably, Linden pleaded, &#34;Ms. Harper.please understand,I had no part in this.Elyse promised me time with Nina in exchange for a favor,but murder was never my intention,I promise you that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips, her voice light &#34;Really now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden gave a frantic nod. Without a word, Daniela pulled out her phone and began to play back recordings of every conversation Linden had shared with Elyse and Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes bulged with realization as he faced Daniela. &#34;You&#39;ve known everything all this time! Then why...?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft laugh, Daniela replied, &#34;Why did I allow myself to be brought here today? I was curious to see whether you were behind the attempt on my life or if it was those two women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran through Linden. Stuttering,he insisted, &#34;It wasn&#39;t me, I swear. I would never dare.&#34; Daniela eyed him, amusement in her gaze. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again. Linden nodded eagerly. &#34;Absolutely! I am at your command. Whatever you need, I&#39;ll do it. It&#39;s them -they&#39;re the threat,not me. They wanted to kill you!Ms. Harper, let me assist you with your investigation.Just,please,spare my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again,Daniela&#39;s chuckle was soft yet chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Natalie was engrossed with her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pulling up live feeds from the hotel&#39;s room camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squinting,she murmured,&#34;Where could they be?&#34;</p>
