                <p>Alexander had thought everything through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of passively waiting, he decided to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he and Daniela were to have a child together, he believed it would cement his place in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As people age, physical appearances matter less and less. What really matters is blood ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander thought that if they shared a child,Daniela&#39;s feelings for him might deepen over time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Daniela full of hope, awaiting her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s look grew increasingly intense, making Alexander somewhat self-conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been ages since she had regarded him with such an intense gaze. Still, he couldn&#39;t shake off a nagging sense of insecurity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he had undergone facial surgery, he worried she might notice something off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze shifted away, revealing a hint of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His ears reddened, and he lowered his voice as he said, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pointed at Alexander&#39;s nose. &#34;Your skin is sagging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Alexander stood up abruptly, wishing for a mirror to check his reflection. &#34;How could that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurriedly searched for a mirror, but there was none to be found in Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, he turned on his phone camera and started inspecting his nose from every angle. Having had plastic surgery, he was particularly conscious about how he looked and what others thought, always aiming for perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had complete trust in Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when she said it, he took it to heart without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had arrived confident but now felt compelled to leave hastily. &#34;Daniela, I need to go,&#34; he said,covering his nose. &#34;We&#39;ll talk about this another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Alexander hurried to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, Lillian asked, &#34;Daniela, is his skin really sagging?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander strained to hear as Daniela sighed deeply and said, &#34;Anything fake will always fall short of the natural.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These words echoed in Alexander&#39;s mind, heavy with implication. He felt exposed, like a flawed product, and quickly covered his face with a mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing back to his office, he asked his secretary for an opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary scrutinized him closely. &#34;No, it doesn&#39;t look saggy at all. Actually, I think it looks even better than Cedric&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was a flatterer and wasn&#39;t in the habit of paying attention to people&#39;s noses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t recall what Alexander&#39;s nose had looked like before, and he had never met Cedric in person.Yet, offering compliments was a routine part of his job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Alexander suddenly snapped. &#34;You&#39;re all just flattering liars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He examined his reflection over and over, convinced something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was embarrassed. How could this happen just as he was opening up to Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything artificial will always fall short of the natural.&#34; Daniela&#39;s words stung like needles, making it hard for him to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander instructed his secretary to book the earliest possible flight to the country where he had gotten his surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, as he hurried out, seven people blocked the entrance to his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a black mask, Alexander was visibly agitated. &#34;Move aside! I have urgent matters to deal with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was visibly anxious. &#34;What urgent business could you possibly have? Did you see Daniela? What did she say? Why is she targeting us again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it seemed she had targeted him first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reputation had barely started to recover when Daniela began making moves. Was she out to destroy him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why target him first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was short on patience. &#34;I&#39;ve told you,I&#39;m busy right now. We&#39;ll talk when I return in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno protested, &#34;A few days? Alexander,are you serious? We&#39;re in the middle of a corporate war! lf you&#39;re gone for a few days, we might be wiped out by the time you return!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, still reeling from their last crisis, interjected,&#34;Exactly! You&#39;re the president of the association.How can you leave at such a critical time? If you do,you don&#39;t deserve to be president.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley also showed his frustration. &#34;Alexander, can&#39;t you at least act responsibly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp blocked the exit. &#34;No, you&#39;re not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander checked his watch, his anxiety mounting.&#34;You bring that up now, but when Daniela stepped back and you all excluded me, you didn&#39;t care that l</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was the president. Now you need me because there&#39;s trouble. I&#39;m telling you, move! I have urgent business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Hackett shouted. &#34;The issues at the association are more critical. What could possibly be so urgent that you need to leave right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander closed his eyes for a moment. &#34;I need to undergo facial reconstruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revelation left the seven of them stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pushed past them, not looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett questioned his own ears. He stood baffled for a long while before turning to Bruno. &#34;Did you hear Alexander say he&#39;s going for what? I must be losing my hearing. Did he really say facial reconstruction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno was just as shocked. &#34;Yeah, I heard that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, they all burst out in disbelief. &#34;Alexander&#39;s lost his mind! With everything falling apart here, he&#39;s worried about facial reconstruction!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was overwhelmed with regret. &#34;I really regret it now. If I had known, I never would have supported him as president.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley sneered, &#34;He&#39;s so obsessed with his looks?&#34;</p>
