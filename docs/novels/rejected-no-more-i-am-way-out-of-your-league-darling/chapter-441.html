                <p>The next day, Linden strode into Daniela&#39;s office and announced, &#34;Ms. Harper, I&#39;m dating Natalie now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, seated at her desk, offered a composed smile. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful news. Natalie is my cousin,and I truly hope this relationship works out for her. The company isn&#39;t too busy right now, so take advantage of the downtime-spend more time together. Linden, you have my permission to move your desk next to Natalie&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie heard about it, she went pale, her shock evident. She stormed over to Linden, her usual haughty demeanor intact. &#34;Have you completely lost your mind? What possessed you to tell Daniela we&#39;re dating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden met her glare with icy indifference. &#34;You&#39;ve already slept with me, yet you refuse to admit you&#39;re my girlfriend. What, are you just going to let me use you and walk away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he wrapped an arm around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s breath hitched, and she immediately tried to shove him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Linden wasn&#39;t letting go. He pinned her against the window, his grip firm,and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie fought back, twisting in his hold, but Linden refused to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips moved from hers to her neck, his touch leaving her breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic set in-she was on the verge of losing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved at his chest with all her strength, but compared to Linden, her resistance was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Nina happened to walk by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated, Natalie&#39;s eyes darted towards her, seeking for help. But Nina only smirked, her expression dripping with mockery. She pulled out her phone, snapped a picture of the scene,and sent it straight into the company&#39;s group chat. Natalie&#39;s heart plummeted. Tears welled in her eyes, spilling down her face as her composure shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden watched Natalie, his puIse quickening at the sight of her tear-streaked face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands roamed over her, pressing her against the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they weren&#39;t standing in the company&#39;s corridor, he might have gone even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took half an hour before he finally let her go. Natalie gasped for breath, her chest rising and falling erratically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire body trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t comprehend why Linden had suddenly turned so aggressive-all she knew was that the way he had just treated her had left her shaken to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear,shame, and revulsion twisted inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden saw it all written on her face. His expression darkened. &#34;What&#39;s with that look? You didn&#39;t want me to kiss you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie furiously wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. &#34;You&#39;re insane. Why the hell did you tell Daniela we were dating? For the record, I never agreedto be with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glint flashed through Linden&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His low chuckle sent an eerie chill down Natalie&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he smirked at her made her stomach turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, let me spell it out for you. If you don&#39;t get in my bed and admit you belong to me, then don&#39;t expect me to lift a finger to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed, smoothing down her disheveled hair with a flick of her wrist. &#34;I already slept with you. If you break your promise, then don&#39;t expect to touch me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s sneer deepened, dripping with mockery. &#34;Was it really you I slept with back then? Natalie, if you dare lie to me, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34; Natalie&#39;s breath caught in her throat, her eyes widening in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;Natalie, I know you think you&#39;re better than me. That&#39;s fine. But mark my words-one day, you&#39;ll be the one begging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he spun on his heel and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes, watching his retreating figure, then scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her to beg him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was delusional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped aside just as the elevator doors slid open, revealing Elyse,who burst out in a panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw Natalie&#39;s red-rimmed eyes, her expression darkened. &#34;Sweetheart, what happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where is that bastard Linden? How dare he do this to you? I swear, I&#39;ll make him pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s hands clenched at her sides, her rage barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Natalie was untouchable, her future resting on a man like Cedric-a man of power and prestige.There was no way she&#39;d let someone like Linden taint her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;Mom, how did you even find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face twisted with indignation. &#34;You don&#39;t know? Nina took a picture of Linden pinning you against the window and posted it in the company&#39;s group chat. Now, the whole office thinks you&#39;re with him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s fury reached a boiling point.&#34;And your own sister-Nina-stood there and let it happen! Just wait until I deal with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression turned cold as she yanked out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company&#39;s group chat was in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Linden and Natalie? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have to be a couple! Did you see how intense that was?&#34; &#34;Oh my God, he actually managed to land someone way out of his league!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always thought Natalie was untouchable--she only ever smiled at Cedric and ignored the rest of us. How did Linden manage to reel her in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hah! What a fake! Acting all high and mighty, but just look at that picture-Linden&#39;s got his hands all over her, kissing her neck. She&#39;s obviously into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So the belle of the company is just another flirt? Unbelievable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, don&#39;t say that. Daniela is still the real top beauty around here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I second that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chat exploded as nearly everyone chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Natalie flung her phone onto the desk. &#34;I swear,I&#39;ll strangle these gossiping idiots!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole body trembled with rage. &#34;Cedric is working in Elite Lux these days. If he sees this garbage,what&#39;s he going to think of me? Am I going to lose my chance?&#34;</p>
