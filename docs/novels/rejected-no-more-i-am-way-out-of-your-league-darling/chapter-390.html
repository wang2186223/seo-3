                <p>At first, Daniela didn&#39;t quite catch what was said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian repeated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Did he really say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded, her eyes gleaming with amusement.&#34;Yeah,you should have seen it. Cedric was practically glowing with pride when he said it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were talking, Natalie pushed the door open, catching the tail end of the conversation. &#34;Let him be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was so indulgent, it didn&#39;t feel like it was meant for just any suitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s hands tightened into fists at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was truly a disappointment-completely no match for Cedric. Despite her best efforts to sow discord, they hadn&#39;t broken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered in the room for a moment before her eyes shifted to Nina, standing just outside the hallway, her eyes soft and full of longing as she watched Cedric. Natalie moved towards her,her voice low as she leaned in. &#34;Nina, staring at him like that won&#39;t get you anywhere. Do you even know how to win Cedric&#39;s heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s lips pressed together, a flash of irritation crossing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t understand why Daniela and Cedric had suddenly reconciled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t they been on the verge of breaking up? And now, after just one night, everything was back to normal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, it seemed like their relationship was even stronger than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was doting on Daniela like never before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, Nina felt like an intruder, embarrassed to even stay in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a foul mood, Nina shot back at Natalie, her tone sharp. &#34;I don&#39;t know, do you? From what I see, Cedric barely even notices you. And to think Mom used to say how much you look like Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s teeth clenched, her eyes blazing with indignation. But in the end, she took a slow breath,swallowing her anger, and forced a smile. &#34;Nina, I don&#39;t want to fight with you. We&#39;re sisters, and all this bickering will only hurt us in the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina glanced at her, the words lingering in the air between them. &#34;Then tell me,how can I win Cedric&#39;s heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze drifted toward Daniela&#39;s office before she answered quietly, &#34;Play to his preferences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina narrowed her eyes. &#34;Cedric doesn&#39;t have many interests. His only focus is Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause followed, thick with meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina slowly turned to look at Natalie, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it?&#34; Natalie asked, a sly smile curling at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood still for a moment, her gaze distant, before she moved towards Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric was alone. Daniela had gone to a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina placed a beautifully wrapped box on Daniela&#39;s desk, her fingers brushing over the packaging. On her way out, she paused by Cedric&#39;s desk. &#34;Cedric, would you like to try the pasties?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric opened his mouth to decline, but Nina added with a warm smile, &#34;I gave some to Daniela before,and she really liked them. So I brought another box  today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Cedric&#39;s gaze flickered towvard the box Nina offered. The pasties looked exquisite, their delicate rose fragrance wafting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked one up, taking a small bite. He chewed thoughtfully, then nodded.&#34;Not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Cedric spotted the box of rose pastries resting on Daniela&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s smile was subtle but victorious as she turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rose pastries were a specialty from Brylee&#39;s hometown-delicately fragrant, with just the right touch of sweetness. They were Brylee&#39;s favorite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had developed a fondness for them, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, a master in the kitchen, often made them, and Nina would bring them to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had once found the task tedious, but today, she was eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned from her meeting,she casually picked up a pastry and took a bite. Cedric watched her,his attention focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at him and smiled. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34; &#34;Do you like these pastries?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; Cedric nodded, then turned back to his work,though his thoughts lingered on the pastries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, as Daniela prepared for a dinner event, Cedric walked over to Nina, his curiosity piqued.&#34;Where did you get those pastries from this afternoon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s heart leaped in her chest,her excitement barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost stumbled over her words. Natalie, standing nearby, couldn&#39;t hide her smile as she answered for her. &#34;Nina made them herself. She&#39;s really skilled with these things. Mom always said Brylee adored these traditional-style pastries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze shifted to Nina, his tone filled with quiet interest. &#34;You made them yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s face flushed crimson, her heart hammering as she struggled to meet Cedric&#39;s gaze. &#34;Yes, I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes softened, his curiosity growing. &#34;Could you teach others how to make them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s joy was evident, her voice bright as she nodded eagerly.&#34;Yes, of course!&#34; Cedric smiled politely. &#34;Thank you. Tomorrow is the weekend. Could I have someone pick you up at eight in the morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s excitement bubbled up, her cheeks turning a deep shade of pink. &#34;Yes, of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small nod, his voice calm and composed. &#34;I&#39;ll pay you the market rate for teaching,plus an additional fee for your effort-totaling a hundred thousand. Does that seem fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina quickly shook her head, hands waving in protest.&#34;No need, I&#39;ll teach for free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hundred thousand, just for teaching a simple recipe,felt far too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t press the matter further. To him,the price was irrelevant-as long as Daniela was pleased,even a million would be worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He transferred the money to Nina without hesitation and turned to head back to his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at the notification on her phone, her eyes wide with disbelief. She turned to Natalie, barely able to contain her excitement. &#34;Natalie, did you hear that?Cedric asked me out. I need to get a stylish outfit.This time, I&#39;ll make sure I succeed.&#34;</p>
