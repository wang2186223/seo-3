                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice carried a gentle undertone as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Josie, engrossed in her kitchen tasks, paused to glance over at him. She let out a soft chuckle and silently cheered for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of nervousness washed over Cedric immediately after his words left his mouth. He found himself unable to look Daniela in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand clenched around his fork, the grip so tight that his knuckles whitened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent for a long moment, a palpable tension hanging heavily in the air, muting all other sounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric moistened his lips and his voice was a whisper when he spoke again. &#34;Phillips Group stands at the forefront of the renovation sector. If you give me the chance to lead this project, I assure you it will be executed exquisitely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched on, during which Cedric had an epiphany. Daniela was offering him a way out, an opportunity to preserve his dignity with grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Cedric rejected her silent offer of mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was beyond caring about appearances or pride at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he desired, the only thing he yearned for, was a straightforward response from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sincerely want to partner with Elite Lux on this project. It means more to me than any previous venture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had yet to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, Cedric also lapsed into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, the soup simmered quietly on the stove. Daniela pursed her lips, wrestling with her thoughts uncertain of her next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a lengthy pause before she could speak, her tone serene yet laden with weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always been the kind of person who dedicates their entire being to someone else. Entrusting all my hopes to one individual never gave me any stability-it always felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to crumble.Cedric, you&#39;re wonderful, truly. However, that&#39;s precisely why I can&#39;t entrust this project to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she rose, opened the door, and departed for her job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained frozen at the table, lost in his contemplation. Josie peeked from the kitchen, observed his still form, and sighed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day&#39;s sunlight was gentle, casting mellow, golden hues throughout the room. Cedric&#39;s hands were tightly clasped, his lips drawn into a narrow line, as if navigating through a labyrinth of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie approached, bearing a bowl of the warm soup, and placed it before him, hoping to lift his spirits.&#34;Daniela actually-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cut her off. &#34;Your son is in the renovation business, isn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie nodded. &#34;Yes, he does. You were the one who recommended it, right? You mentioned he should explore renovation projects. He&#39;s been excelling lately! Just last month, he secured a contract worth over a hundred thousand dollars. He was so excited that he didn&#39;t sleep all night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a warm, affectionate smile as she reminisced about her son&#39;s enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she paused when she noticed Cedric smiling as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver of unease trickled down her spine. &#34;Please don&#39;t smile like that. It&#39;s unsettling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josie, would you want your son to be even happier?&#34; Cedric asked, his tone smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s pause, Josie answered, &#34;Of course, but there&#39;s a limit to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could even finish her sentence, Cedric jumped in. &#34;That&#39;s settled, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Tyler Maynard was visibly stunned as he stared at the tender document in his hands. &#34;Two, two... Two billion and five hundred million for a project? Are you serious about this?&#34; His eyes were wide with disbelief as he gestured wildly. &#34;Mr. Phillips, you must be kidding! Two million, maybe, but two billion? That&#39;s absolutely insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spoke with composed assurance. &#34;Relax. I&#39;ll personally oversee this project for you. All the profits will be yours. Just one thing-this must remain completely under wraps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days later, an unexpected player made a splash in the Olisvine renovation scene, stirring the waters of the business community and unnerving the industry&#39;s heavyweights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word was out. This newcomer had confidently presented a partnership offer to the prestigious Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation sent shockwaves through the Bennett family, prompting a frenzied search for clues about the enigmatic company&#39;s owner. Despite their extensive efforts, Tyler appeared to have sprung from thin air,with not a single breadcrumb leading back to a prior business footprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, too, had her eye on this curious new entity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tasked Ryan with some sleuthing, and he reported back, coolly providing the details Cedric had shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve done a thorough check. The company&#39;s solid-decent folks, no sketchy background.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela perused the documents briefly, then looked up at him, her eyes reflecting a mix of intrigue and suspicion. &#34;Do you know them personally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Family...&#34; Ryan stopped for a moment, then added, &#34;Kind of, yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reclined in her chair, placing the folder on the desk. &#34;Family? In that case, you&#39;ll oversee the initial contracts and the vetting process. If everything checks out, you&#39;re cleared to seal the deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was well aware of Daniela&#39;s readiness to assist those tied to her team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mentioning &#34;family&#34; was enough to convince her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Provided the company met the standard criteria, the agreement was practically guaranteed-bypassing the usual competitive bidding. With that, Ryan gave a nod and exited the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he was out the door, he fired off a short message to Cedric. &#34;OK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian,walking by, caught sight of this and emitted a soft whistle. &#34;Wow. You really have Cedric&#39;s back, don&#39;t you? Stepping up for him like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, a lollipop tucked in his cheek, shot back, &#34;Could you erect a business empire in mere days for someone who has already rejected you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reconstructing a billion-dollar renovation business required more than just capital. It demanded a vast network of labor, resources, and connections to kickstart operations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,after laying the foundation, significant investment of actual, hard-earned cash was essential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an era marked by capricious and hurried attitudes, who else would commit so thoroughly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was one who dared.</p>
