                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaming startup had recently rolled out a new mobile game, now in lts beta phase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was engrossed in testing it, lounging comfortably on the couch with her phone in hand, when Caiden entered, fresh from the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he neared Daniela, he couldn&#39;t help but throw a cautious glance over his shoulder. Cedric, who was standing a short distance away, caught themovement with his keen eyes, missing nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Caiden&#39;s spine as he met Cedric&#39;s icy stare, which seemed to pierce right through him. The air thickened with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need something?&#34; Cedric pressed, his voice cutting through the quiet with an icy sharpness that caused Caiden&#39;s heart to race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden responded with an awkward chuckle, his laugh sounding more strained than he intended.He had hoped to join Daniela on the couch, but before he could make his move, Lillian swept into the spot with a triumphant grin. Annoyance flashed across Caiden&#39;s face at being preempted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did Daniela even come across these freaks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Caiden, they were simply a band of eccentrics, sorely lacking any semblance of common courtesy or respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a click of his tongue, Caiden fetched a small stool and took a seat beside Daniela. &#34;Daniela, your company is flourishing, but you really shouldn&#39;t spend your entire day immersed in games. They&#39;re not good for your eyes, you know.&#34; Peering over at her phone screen, Caiden caught a glimpse of the game title-Shadow Strike. The name alone prompted a frown to crease his brow; it hardly seemed like a meaningful or productive way to pass the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked his tongue once more, a gesture of his disapproval, as he awaited her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time ticked by, and yet Daniela continued to ignore him as if he weren&#39;t even there. Caiden felt his patience dwindling and his irritation intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What sort of behavior was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he recalled Katrina&#39;s advice to adopt a gentler method.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing his irritation, Caiden managed a smile and gently tapped on Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This action finally prompted Daniela to tear her gaze from her phone, fixing him with a chilly look. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing urgent. I was just hoping we could have a chat. It&#39;s been ages since we&#39;ve had a real heart-to-heart,just you and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela emitted a sharp, scornful chuckle. &#34;Really? You&#39;re always so busy. It hardly makes a difference whether we speak or not, does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s features contorted slightly, a flicker of irritation crossinng his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a nervous chuckle, but the edge of bitterness in his voice was hard to miss.f course, we can talk. Let&#39;s put the past behind us, shall we? You&#39;re still my beloved daughter, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered no reply, her indifference clearly evident, not bothering to mask her lack of interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy silence that hung in the air was stifling, leaving Caiden feeling exposed and humiliated. Still, he forced himself to push forward. &#34;Sweetheart, you can&#39;t imagine how tough it&#39;s been for me. Do you think my life has been a walk in the park? When your mother passed away, you were just five. I was left to juggle a huge company and contend with senior executives who made my life hell. And Seth Elliott-let&#39;s not even go into that! He led the first group to break away from Harper Group. Do you have any idea how many assets he took with him? That man was nothing short of a-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cut off mid-sentence as Danjela&#39;s hand moved abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s brow furrowed, his confusion palpable as he watched her closely.&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Am I wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so you know, I&#39;ve been in touch with Seth recently.&#34; A trace of panic flickered across Caiden&#39;s features, his face momentarily frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t Seth&#39;s choice to leave, was it? He and the others were devoted to you, yet your mistrust pushed them away from the company. Seth confided in me that once i stabilize the operations, he&#39;s prepared to return everything he took upon his departure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of redness washed over Caiden&#39;s face, leaving him visibly flustered. &#34;He really mentioned that?1hadn&#39;t realized he still held such regard for you. But then again, could It be because of your mother? Seth had a soft spot for her. They maintained a facade of friendship, but the glances they exchanged were telling.It wasn&#39;t appropriate. And Daniela, you persistently fault me for marrying Katrina shortly after your mother passed, but how can you be so certain your mother was faithful to me first? This city is teeming with businesses led boy men. But your mother had to be the exception, venturing into the business realm herself.Do you honestly believe a woman could succeed alone in such a world? Who knows how many men...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slammed a hefty ashtray down onto the table with all her might. The glass shattered, sending shards scattering across the room.</p>
