                <p>Before speaking with Daniela, Katrina had called Joyce, but the latter had refused to answer. Then, she had dialed Alexander&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the phone rang and connected, she began to talk to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela left, Katrina turned to her phone, tears welling up. &#34;Did you hear that, Alexander? Joyce was manipulated by Daniela. She didn&#39;t betray y/ou of her own will. It was all Daniela&#39;s doing. Can&#39;t you see the cruelty that lies beneath Daniela&#39;s pretty face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was convinced that Alexander might become Joyce&#39;s saving grace in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Joyce were to regret her actions, perhaps Alexander might feel some sympathy for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, I have always shown you a basic level of respect, yet now I feel you&#39;re making a fool of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was taken aback. &#34;Alexander, why would you think that? You just heard Daniela&#39;s confession. I&#39;m not deceiving you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Alexander gave a sarcastic smile. &#34;It seems you believe I&#39;m completely naive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued, &#34;If Joyce was truly unwilling, nobody could have compelled her. Besides, during our marriage, she showed a clear interest in other rich men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart missed a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hadn&#39;t brought it up before because | didn&#39;t think it was important. Our connection never deepened.It wasn&#39;t Daniela causing issues; it was the marriage itself. We never should have entered into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Katrina quickly interjected, &#34;How can you say that? Alexander, I know you don&#39;t mean it.You&#39;re just too angry.&#34; Alexander, however, refused to listen further. &#34;I&#39;m clear about my feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina frowned, understanding that sometimes silence was preferable, as speaking certain truths could irreversibly damage paths back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, however, Alexander was unusually direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During that fire, I saved Joyce instead of Daniela, so you all assumed I harbored feelings for Joyce. If that&#39;s what you think, I&#39;d rather clarify things now instead of later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted to interrupt him, but Alexander persisted bluntly, saying,&#34;|′Vealways been unclear about my feelings, and now, I deeply regret that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander emphasized his regret. &#34;Given another chance, I would&#39;ve defended Daniela fiercely. But now,merely glimpsing her feels like a privilege.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A profound emptiness washed over Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided not to question whether Alexander&#39;s regrets stemmed from Daniela&#39;s newfound prominence or from a realization of his enduring affection for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew only one thing: the backup plan she had for Joyce was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their call had concluded quite some time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Katrina couldn&#39;t shake the sound of Alexander&#39;s final words echoing in her mind.11|should have told you earlier that I love Daniela. Regardless of her status today, my love remains unchanged. Even if she orchestrated my situation with Joyce, I am happy. So,please stop calling me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation ended right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair washed over Katrina as she looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, all her strategies for Joyce were conclusively ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela walked into the company the next morning, seeing Alexander there didn&#39;t surprise her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was no fool; his success wasn&#39;t based on luck. He could sense something off in Daniela&#39;s behaviot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina called me yesterday. You were aware, weren&#39;t you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t attempt to hide it. &#34;Yes, I kneve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander experienced a blend of sadness and a hint of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was saddened because Daniela had shown him her more ruthless side, which wasn&#39;t typically exposed to someone cared about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he felt a sense of happiness that Daniela chose to reveal this aspect to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this mean she trusted him, even slightly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile appeared on Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve warned you before about Katrina; she&#39;s dangerous. Desperate times lead to desperate measures. Why didn&#39;t you listen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was questioning, yet his gentle tone carried more warmth than accusation, sounding almost tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression immediately contorted in disgust, as if she had just tasted something foul. She stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her defensive stance saddened Alexander. &#34;Daniela, I mnean no harm. I&#39;m merely here to remind you. There are many ways to seek revenge, but you opted for the harshest one. Why choose such a path? You&#39;re the CEO of Elite Lux now. Your mother passed away long ago. Why allow someone from your past to spoil your promising future? You know there&#39;s more to life than vengeance. Think about the family and children you once dreamed of, or the hobbies that bring you joy. These could help you overcome your resentment.Daniela, perhaps you could give me a chance to help you let go of this hatred. You have to trust me now.&#34;</p>
