                <p>Caiden was reluctant to talk to Daniela.He perceived that she had turned from the obedient daughter she once was into someone ruthless, now even rivaling Cedric in her methods. It seemed she was intent on cornering him, her own father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t have much money left. Ten thousand dollars barely covered the cost of essential nutritional supplements, much less their escalating expenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s frequent beauty salon visits had completely exhausted their financial reserves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride was of no use in paying the bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned, Caiden muttered to himself and hesitantly took a seat next to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared engrossed in testing a new beta  version of a video game, which greatly annoyed Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t see the purpose of her busyness. It wasn&#39;t as if she was actively working to salvage the financially hemorrhaging Harper Group. Daniela was merely at home playing games, while the company&#39;s operational costs continued to deplete their resources rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never thought that he&#39;d actually have to start worrying about the company&#39;s operations after taking it over from Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed deeply, his frustration evident. Trying to mask his feelings, he forced a smile and addressed Daniela. &#34;I&#39;ve transferred all the funds to Harper Group&#39;s account. Can the company resume normal operations now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up from her game. She nonchalantly sucked on a lollipop Lillian had given her earlier and murmured, &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by frustration, Caiden exclaimed, &#34;Then why don&#39;t you take some action? You just sit here all day playing games. When will you start worrying about Harper Group&#39;s survival?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused her game momentarily and gave him a fleeting look. Then she resumed her game and responded in a detached tone, &#34;If you had been concerned about the company&#39;s survival earlier,we wouldn&#39;t be in this predicament. I was informed by the finance department this morning that Harper Group has been losing money all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression hardened. He was well aware of the situation. But he had Brylee&#39;s savings supporting the company in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should turn things around! Revive your mother&#39;s legacy!&#34; Caiden exclaimed, trying to sound encouraging. &#34;After all, you are her daughter. You have her looks, her talents, and skills. Now that Harper Group is in your hands, it&#39;ll recover in no time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela completed her game and started another. Meanwhile,Caiden was growing increasingly anxious.&#34;Say something!&#34; he implored. He had invested heavily in the company, depleting his savings. He needed a return on his investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say what?&#34; Daniela responded, without looking up,her voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Caiden tried to compose himself, adopting a compassionate demeanor. &#34;|know you&#39;ve got a lot on your plate, and perhaps Harper Group&#39;s minor assets don&#39;t seem appealing now. But this was your mother&#39;s life&#39;s work. Surely you don&#39;t want to see it fall apart, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a light nod. &#34;Hmm. Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t go bankrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, Caiden quickly asked, &#34;So, you have a plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;No, I&#39;ve never managed a company that&#39;s this deep in the red, with such outdated equipment, lackadaisical employees, and lax management. I&#39;m just as lost as you are.&#34; &#34;What?&#34; Caiden exclaimed, jumping from his seat.&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused her game and looked up at him, her gaze steady and her tone slightly amused. &#34;Since you&#39;re one of the major shareholders, I&#39;m eager to hear your proposals for resolving the company&#39;s crisis. After all, you&#39;ve managed it for years. You should have plenty of insights and experience to contribute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck Caiden profoundly. If he spoke further, he would have to confess that his mismanagement had led the company to ruin. Yet,as Daniela&#39;s father, his pride remained intact. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to admit that his inadequate leadership was the reason Harper Group was teetering on the edge of failure.</p>
