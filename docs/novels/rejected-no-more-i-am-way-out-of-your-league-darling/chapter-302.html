                <p>Katrina shook uncontrollably after hearing Daniela&#39;s final words. A look of fear flashed across her face,soon replaced by complete confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already gone upstairs, and though some time had passed, Katrina&#39;s hands remained chilled by the shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicions were one thing, but when Katrina confronted the harsh reality, her mind spiraled into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was already upstairs, and Cedric had gone up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden approached Katrina with confusion written across his face. &#34;What did she say? Aren&#39;t you overreacting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina slowly lifted her pale face. She tried to speak, her mouth opening and closing several times, before the words finally tumbled out, choked with tears.&#34;She told me she knows what it&#39;s like to watch the person you love most walk away and she wants me to feel that same pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled as she locked eyes with Caiden.&#34;What does Daniela mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease washed over Caiden. After a long,tense pause, he spoke flatly. &#34;Is there any point in pretending anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now, Daniela hadn&#39;t asked a single question about the past. But she was convinced that Katrina had murdered her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina wanted to defend herself. She walked up to Daniela&#39;s door, but as she stood there, she found herself at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric came out to get some milk for Daniela, and saw Katrina standing by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping he would be easier to convince, Katrina said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, I had nothing to do with Brylee&#39;s death. The police investigated, and I had a solid alibi. Daniela can&#39;t accuse me without any proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her breath, hoping he&#39;d believe her. But Cedric&#39;s response was even colder than Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze hardened as memories surfaced-how Daniela had grown up without a mother&#39;s love, while Katrina had taken everything that had once belonged to Brylee, and raised her own daughter like royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of rage coursed through Cedric; he wanted to destroy Katrina in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic gripped Katrina as she stumbled backward, her balance slipping before she tumbled down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scream echoed through the villa, sharp and filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had broken two ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was rushed to the hospital, Joyce burst out of her room. She stood there, utterly confused, the weight of the situation crashing down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hoped Katrina would save her from the cruel torment. But now that Katrina was injured, what could she do? What was left for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze at the top of the stairs, her legs trembling as memories of the endless, inhuman torture she had suffered flooded her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling herself, she made her way slowly down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Caiden watching TV, she tried to summon the image of the obedient daughter she once was.&#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden didn&#39;t even glance at her, his voice cold as he snorted. &#34;I&#39;m not your dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce understood the resentment in his voice.Kneeling beside him, she tried to reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face remained ghostly pale, still marked by the trauma she had suffered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With desperation, she grasped Caiden&#39;s hand and begged, &#34;Dad, I know l acted horribly before, but l&#39;ve changed. You&#39;re getting older. Please, let me take care of you. I&#39;m still your loyal daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze shifted to Joyce at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he had once cared deeply for her, and for a moment, compassion stirred in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce bowed her head, letting it rest against his knee, her voice soft and vulnerable. &#34;Dad, you know l&#39;ve always been a bit naive, just a little stubborn.You&#39;ll forgive me, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his jaw, his silence speaking volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the familiar softness in his expression, Joyce pressed further, her eyes shining with determination.&#34;I really mean it, Dad. Everything I&#39;ve gone through has shown me just how much family matters. You&#39;re the most important person in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden often melted at sweet words, but Joyce&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>next words caught him off guard. &#34;Dad, if you pay off that hundred-million-dollar debt for me, I&#39;ll change my last name to Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of a hundred million shattered any lingering fantasy Caiden had of a heartfelt family reconciliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; Caiden squinted at Joyce, his confusion quickly turning to disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have once been his daughter, but now she seemed like a parasite, clinging to him with nothing but greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking she had finally softened him, Joyce was blindsided by what happened next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden suddenly sprang to his feet, and Joyce was thrown off balance, stumbling to the floor in shock.&#34;Dad...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare call me Dad. Have you lost all sense of guilt? I fed you, clothed you, and raised you.I even turned my back on my own daughter for you. And now you want to take everything I have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shook her head fervently. &#34;Dad, I have no way out. Please, help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sneered. &#34;Yes, you have no way out. If you had one, you wouldn&#39;t be begging. You ran off with that useless Milo. Now that you&#39;ve been fooled, deal with it on your own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sat motionless on the floor, her gaze blank as she stared into the vast emptiness of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered a time when she had been the beloved daughter, adored by Caiden, with her mother holding the highest place of favor in the household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been a prominent socialite in Olisvine,admired and envied by many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t comprehend how she had fallen so far,reduced to a figure of disdain and contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness filled her chest, like a growing storm. Her heart felt cold, as though it had stopped beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless torment she had endured felt like a slow,unrelenting agony, each day stretching out longer than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no one to turn to, no one to lean on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being dragged away again,tossed into that dark warehouse to face another round of cruelty, filled her with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling legs, Joyce made her way upstairs,the maid&#39;s calls echoing behind her, but she didn&#39;t stop or answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped out onto the balcony, the cold wind hit her face sharply, as though it was trying to strip away the last shreds of her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, Joyce felt an odd sense of relief, a strange kind of peace settling over her.</p>
