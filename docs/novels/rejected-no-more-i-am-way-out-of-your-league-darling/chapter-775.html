                <p>Charles was surprisingly generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked a little uneasy as he faced Daniela. &#34;So,what&#39;s your take on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother softening her response. &#34;Why not?Free money&#39;s not something people turn down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles lit up like a kid at Christmas. &#34;Perfect! We&#39;re all set,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Yes. But don&#39;t rush anything. Wait for my company to build up first. Step in when the timing&#39;s right. And keep your distance in public. Don&#39;t get too friendly with me or Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave a sly grin. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been tending the flowers nearby,turned in time to catch Charles looking way too pleased with himself. His face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles waved as he walked off, humming like nothing was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ground his teeth. &#34;Why is he even here?&#34; Daniela turned to look at his puffed-up face and let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small smile from her wiped Cedric&#39;s mind clean of whatever complaint he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re actually smiling? I haven&#39;t seen you smile like that in ages.&#34; His gaze locked onto her. &#34;You look just as stunning as ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a long breath and gave him a look.&#34;What an ass-licker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;That&#39;s Charles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not too far off, Carol was sunbathing like she didn&#39;t have a care in the world. She glanced over and sent a quick message to Ryan and Lillian. &#34;We don&#39;t need to do anything. They&#39;re already drawn to each other&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan replied, &#34;Daniela does have unmatched charm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian added, &#34;Tell Cedric to pick up the pace.We&#39;re showing up next week at the latest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol shared that with Cedric, his eyes stayed glued to Daniela. That look in them-possessive,loyal,full of heat-said everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his fists and bit down hard, ready to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s voice rang out on the video call, full of mischief, &#34;Cedric, when we get there, I want to see you and Daniela already sharing a bed. No more waiting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Cedric and Daniela had been sleeping in their respective rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to. He just didn&#39;t have the nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hearing Lillian say that lit a fire in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Carol watched as Cedric stepped into his room, carrying a water pitcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, he returned with a drenched blanket in hand and made his way to Daniela. &#34;My blanket&#39;s soaked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was knee-deep in report reading. She didn&#39;t look up and missed the sly gleam in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still focused on her work, she replied, &#34;Really? Tell the maid. We&#39;ve got extra blankets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was stunned. After a pause, he added, &#34;The mattress is soaked too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a few seconds, then raised her head and looked him in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes wavered. He couldn&#39;t hide how uneasy he felt. &#34;So the blanket&#39;s soaked, and now the mattress is ruined too. What do you expect me to do?&#34; Her tone was calm, but her eyes held a sharper edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t read her face. He just felt unsettled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together and lowered his voice.&#34;Where do I sleep tonight? After the explosion, 1haven&#39;t felt well. If I sleep on the floor or couch, I&#39;ll probably catch something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nod and pointed to a corner &#34;Sleep over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned and saw a dog bed sitting in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol broke into laughter the moment she noticed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Cedric tightened his jaw and followed the maid to get his mattress and blanket replaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid looked at him warmly. &#34;Sir, you and your wife are married. If you want to sleep in the same room,just bring your blanket over. It&#39;s not as complicated as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked at her. &#34;I can do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never lived with parents, so couple life was still new to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she said, tossing the wet blanket into the basket. &#34;Married couples are supposed to share a bed.Besides, I&#39;ve seen how well she treats you. There&#39;s no reason she&#39;d say no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small smile. &#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; he said with a nod</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Carol stayed up, clearly waiting to see how things would turn out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was still focused on her documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his pajamas, Cedric walked over and said, &#34;It&#39;s getting late. You should rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up. &#34;You go ahead and sleep first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood there, unsure what to do next. Then he turned around and walked back to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed where she was, still flipping through reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little while later, the door to Cedric&#39;s room creaked open.</p>
