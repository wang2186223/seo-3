                <p>Cedric could tell right away that Daniela didn&#39;t believe him, but it didn&#39;t bother him. After all, she was right there with him, and the marriage certificate was safely tucked in his pocket. He was now her legal husband, and he felt no worry in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Cedric suggested they go out for a movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched the screen with keen interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, she felt a touch from the side, which jolted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to pull away reflexively when the familiar voice whispered, &#34;Honey, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment clarified everything for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered she was married now, and the man  beside her was her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, with a gentle smile, took Daniela&#39;s hand in his, rested it on his knee, and murmured, &#34;Honey,your hands feel cold. Allow me to warm them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip slightly. Hearing that made her heart flutter unexpectedly. She wondered why this particular nickname made her feel so different when it came from Cedric. It seemed like a tender caress to her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a new sensation for her, one she had not felt with Alexander or during their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling was strange. Yet, she found herself not minding it one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found herself gazing at Cedric&#39;s profile.Feeling her stare, he turned and met her eyes with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a soft tone, he teased, &#34;People often compliment my looks. What&#39;s your verdict?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, ever the serious one, took a moment to examine him more closely upon hearing his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the cinema&#39;s flickering lights, Cedric&#39;s features were sharply cast. His face showed a harrowing handsomeness, the kind that sharpened when he pursed his lips but softened into reliability and warmth when he relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin was smooth, his nose distinguished, and his lips appeared soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips together as Cedric turned his head to smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was tender, his eyes glinting with a bright spark that reflected Daniela&#39;s image back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are indeed quite handsome,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s charm was distinct from Alexander&#39;s polished grace or the gentle charm often attributed to more delicate features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was strong and composed, yet gentle, and his smile had an irresistible charm. Cedric then slightly opened his lips, a deliberate move, as he leaned closer to whisper into her ear,now flushed with warmth. &#34;Remember, I am yours now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s heart skipped a beat. At that moment,her eyes caught the small beauty mark near Cedric&#39;s eye, prompting her to whisper, &#34;Cedric,thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what do you thank me?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dashed into a burning building for me, and you were there when I collapsed in the hospital, carrying me to safety,&#34; Daniela said. &#34;Thank you for always being my protector.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stroked Daniela&#39;s hair, responding,	11|t1S nothing; you are my wife, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am now your wife,&#34; Daniela whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the movie played on, the lead character&#39;s dialogue was engaging, yet Daniela found herself more captivated by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Cedric squeezed her hand a bit tighter,  leaned back, and murmured, &#34;Honey, aside from my looks, I excel in many other areas to00.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, puzzled by his implication, asked, &#34;In what ways?&#34;</p>
