                <p>As Daniela pulled her car into the villa&#39;s driveway, an uneasy sensation prickled at the back of her neck.She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that someone was watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, her eyes darting sharply around the surroundings, but whatever presence she felt seemed to have vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a skeptical arch of her brow, Daniela shrugged off the feeling and stepped inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, while they lounged on the couch watching TV, Cedric told Daniela, &#34;I&#39;ve had your secretary set up a desk for me in your office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up, her expression blank. &#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My office is under renovation.&#34; Daniela chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked her, &#34;Is that okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Daniela replied with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t naive. With the whirlwind recently surrounding Daniela, he silently vowed to stay close and vigilant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolute to find out who dared to target his woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina approached, telling Alexander, &#34;If you want to spend more time with Daniela, you need to head to Elite Lux. There&#39;s plenty of space there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, her eyes drifted over his frame, a satisfied smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened at the way Katrina&#39;s gaze lingered on him. With a frown of distaste, he turned away and retreated to his room without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the shower, his mind churned. All or nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his shower, he went to the mall and picked out an outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, two sales assistants whispered, their curiosity barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would&#39;ve thought such a good-looking guy would be in that line of work? I can&#39;t help but wonder how he&#39;ll look in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ignored them, his pace quickening as he exited the mall and headed home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home, Katrina noticed the distinctive logo on the bag. She smiled knowingly at him. &#34;You&#39;re really pulling out all the stops, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina knew the brand all too well as she was a frequent customer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was renowned for its bold, sensual, and provocative themes, subtly showcasing the intimate dynamics between men and women, making it utterly captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Caiden had loved seeing her in such pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina retreated to her room, her heart racing as memories flooded back. She pressed herself against Caiden,her voice soft and pleading. &#34;Hon-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden cut her off coldly, shoving her aside. His face twisted in disgust. &#34;Don&#39;t start acting up. I wouldn&#39;t be stuck in this damned place if it weren&#39;t for you Katrina! Don&#39;t even think about touching me again.I want a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was infuriated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since marrying Brylee, he had grown accustomed to a life of luxury, not this humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being exiled to such a small house at his age was a bitter pill to swallow, and Katrina only made it worse every time he laid eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she had the audacity to approach him, and he wished he could tear her apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden turned away, closing his eyes as he warned coldly, &#34;Find somewhere else to sleep. If you come near me again, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared silently at the back of Caiden&#39;s head,her eyes narrowing in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. If Caiden wouldn&#39;t give her what she wanted,someone else would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a huff. Passing Alexander&#39;s room on her way to another guest room, she suddenly stopped,her eyes narrowing with curiosity and intrigue.How would Alexander look in that outfit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Alexander was up early. After a quick shower, he left smelling fresh, a bag slung over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina watched him from the corner of the hallway,a knowing smirk tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander headed straight to Elite Lux, determination in his stride.  But a security guard stepped forward, blocking his way at the entrance. &#34;Sorry, sir. I can&#39;t let you through without an appointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time, the guard had failed to stop him and was harshly reprimanded by his supervisor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, when Alexander appeared, the guard was ready, his stance firmn and his eyes sharp.</p>
