                <p>Nikolas shared a look with his brothers, then said, &#34;You will never step foot inside McCoy Group if you lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preventing Daniela from entering McCoy Group meant she would be excluded from its future endeavors.This isolation would weaken Cedric, ensuring Nikolas retained his position as the sole heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught on to what Nikolas was thinking right then. She smiled and retorted, &#34;That&#39;s a pretty bold move. What are you willing to risk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was taken aback, not anticipating such a bold response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been counting on walking away with something without giving up a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked over at his brothers standing next to him, a trace of regret tugging at him. He wished he had pushed them to speak up sooner so he wouldn&#39;t be left carrying the weight of the bet alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he felt trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes met Daniela&#39;s, who looked back amusedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knowing smile irritated him; it was as if she could read his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a crowd formed around them, with cameras zooming in on him, he prepared to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a laugh and said, &#34;You can&#39;t expéct the same trick to work twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; complexion went pale. He responded, &#34;What are you even saying? You were the one who played dirty to win the horse race earlier. I just didn&#39;t think it was worth the trouble to call you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling Daniela&#39;s penetrating stare, Nikolas shifted uncomfortably. He blurted out, &#34;Let&#39;s leave the past behind. Here and now, I&#39;m ready to bet! If I lose, I&#39;ll embarrass myself in the most spectacular fashion. I&#39;ll strip and run around the McCoy family&#39;s estate, even barking like a dog.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled and said, &#34;Nikolas, you sure do like making noise like a barking dog. But the DNA test results made it clear-you and the dog are family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas retorted, &#34;Are we making this bet or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure knows how to entertain. I&#39;m staking my right to enter McCoy Group, and you offer up a few barks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;re hardly on equal ground,&#34; Daniela responded with a dismissive chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration colored Nikolas&#39; demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to retort when whispers cut through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The consequences this time are on a whole different level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe Nikolas doesn&#39;t believe he can come out on top, so he&#39;s too scared to put much on the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s already stuttering. With all the media here, imagine the headlines if he&#39;s seen fearing a challenge from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a disgrace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; expression grew stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, seizing the moment, asked, &#34;I&#39;m risking my access to McCoy Group. How about you? Are you brave enough to bet the permanent management rights of McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd murmured in agreement, &#34;That sounds more like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhearing this, Daniela flashed Nikolas a provocative grin. &#34;Well? You initiated this bet. Are you daring enough to risk your control over McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; cheeks flushed crimson. Fury surged through him like a fire he couldn&#39;t put out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had backed him into a corner, leaving him no room to save face. Her relentless confidence only made it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resented her for refusing to show him any respect in front of such a large crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to shout, &#34;I agree. I would gamble away the management rights of McCoy Group and everything my future holds. I&#39;m not afraid of you, Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even with the knowledge that Damon&#39;s skill with dice was unmatched in all of Oiscoll, he still couldn&#39;t bring himself to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, regret sank deep into his chest. He had been the one to stir his brothers into going after Daniela, and now he was the one caught in this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scanned the crowd-reporters, spectators, all eyes fixed on him. He pressed his lips into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Let&#39;s bet.&#34; Damon smirked, pulling Nikolas behind him. Confident in his skills, he had no doubt he could win. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;Il bet with you. Let&#39;s bet on dice! Whoever rolls the highest wins. If I lose, I&#39;ll walk away from my position at McCoy Group. For good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted her gaze from Nikolas to Damon, sizing him up without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Daniela agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved past Nikolas, she tossed a glance his way and muttered,&#34;Coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from his face. His fists tightened at his sides, but he stayed quiet. Not a single word of protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood watching the scene from the second-floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was unreadable, but his eyes were sharp and ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the crowd buzzed. Phones came up. Cameras clicked. The bet had captured every bit of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon let out a victorious laugh. &#34;Need me to explain the rules, Daniela? Wouldn&#39;t want you to lose before the game even starts. That&#39;d be no fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Damon spoke, he let the dice glide between his fingers, spinning them in a dazzling display of control and flair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each move was calculated, smooth as silk, drawing gasps from the crowd. Impressed voices began to ripple through the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gambling might be his only talent, but no one can top Damon at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Challenging him? Daniela must be out of her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She probably thinks winning a horse race makes her invincible. One win, and suddenly she believes she&#39;s unstoppable. She&#39;s in for a rude awakening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s already decided.Just wait-Daniela will be the one begging for mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers swelling around them grew even louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers wore smug grins, already celebrating a win that hadn&#39;t happened yet.</p>
