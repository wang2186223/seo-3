                <p>A harsh, commanding &#34;Get lost!&#34; echoed through the vast living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze in her tracks, her cheeks flushing with humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That familiar sting of not being good enough compared to Daniela crept in once again,filling the quiet night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew red as she gazed at Cedric&#39;s sharp, chiseled features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t understand what she was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why could he show so much kindness to Daniela but not to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held such warmth for Daniela, yet when they turned to her, they were nothing but icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it about her that fell short next to Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Cedric, with all his capability, refuse to even look her way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with bitterness, Joyce clenched her jaw and tore off the thin robe she had draped around herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been about to settle into bed, used to sleeping with as little as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way to grab a drink, she had casually thrown on a simple robe. Now, she was being naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The late-night breeze cut through the room, sending a chill across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standingtall, Joyce revealed herself completely. She was convinced that Cedric wouldn&#39;t miss her presence in the expansive living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the bedroom, Daniela instinctively reached out for the person she expected to be beside her,but her hand only met cold, empty sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning,she felt around the mattress, the coolness confirming she was alone. She slowly opened her eyes, letting them adjust to the darkness around her. &#34;Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the silent room offered no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tossing the covers aside, Daniela figured he must have gone downstairs for water and decided to check for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached the staircase, her eyes landed on Joyce, who stood completely naked in the middle of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood not far off, seemingly deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown etched onto Daniela&#39;s face as she hurried down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Joyce could utter a word or make a move, Daniela positioned herself in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing the discarded robe from the sofa, Daniela gripped Joyce by the neck and pushed her towards the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce barely had a moment to process what was happening before the robe hit her face with a jarring smack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp impact on her skin fanned the flames of her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked the robe away and was ready to declare that she and Cedric were caught up in&#39;a moment of passion. But as soon as her eyes met Daniela&#39;s piercing glare, she went rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never seen Daniela in such a state before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, Daniela was the picture of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was handling Caiden&#39;s favoritism, going after Alexander, or dealing with the gossip that followed her,she always kept her cool. Her confidence never wavered, and there was never a hint of emotion that could be easily read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Joyce had even convinced herself that Daniela was incapable of feeling anger or contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, when Alexander and Daniela&#39;s marriage fell apart, she didn&#39;t waste time trying to explain herself to the media. Instead, she just showed them the evidence, straightforward and without fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was moments like that which led Joyce to believe Daniela was far too composed to ever lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, Daniela&#39;s icy, piercing stare bore into her, and the grip around her neck gradually tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choking terror of having her life in jeopardy was far worse than the time she had been trapped in that bleak warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think I wouldn&#39;t hurt you?&#34; Daniela&#39;s face was no longer blank; a faint, almost pleasant smile spread across her lps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Joyce opened her mouth to defend herself, intending to blame Cedric for seducing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could say anything, Daniela&#39;s grip on her neck tightened once more, silencing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her other hand, Daniela pressed a finger firmly against Joyce&#39;s lips, stopping her words in their tracks.&#34;I&#39;m not interested in your excuses. I don&#39;t need your denial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror widened Joyce&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze sharpened as her fingers pressed harder into Joyce&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s faceturned ashen, and the blood drained from her features in mere moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s hands slapped desperately at Daniela&#39;s arm, but Daniela shoved her forcefully to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact jolted through her, and Joyce&#39;s head hit the floor with a sickening thud, the blow nearly knocking her unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred and faded at the edges, and for a brief, terrifying moment, she felt as though death was right on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of fear flooded over her, her body trembling as something warm began to trickle down beneath her. &#34;Daniela!&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice rang out, sharp and urgent. &#34;Let her go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never seen Daniela behave this way. She seemed completely deaf to his voice, no matter how much he raised it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to use force, he crouched and encircled Daniela in his arms, whispering,&#34;|′Ss over now. Don&#39;t let it upset you. I&#39;m fine, really. There&#39;s no need to be angry.&#34;</p>
