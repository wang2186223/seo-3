            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela swung open her bedroom door and was instantly enveloped in a tight embrace. A soft chuckle escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clung to her, murmuring, &#34;Daniela, you are my greatest love in this entire world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was truly jealous. Triggered by a cryptic text,he spent all night murmuring sweet words to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon rising the next day, Daniela felt her legs wobble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the door, she was shocked to see Ryan. and Lillian there, arms folded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you two have anything better to do than eavesdrop outside my room?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan shook his head. &#34;We&#39;ve been deceived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s face was grave as she said, &#34;It&#39;s true what they say, the deepest stabs come from the closest knives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Daniela&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back into her room, Ryan and Lillian trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve uncovered three things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela filled a glass with water, waiting for them to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly, Joyce is the one who sent money to the Lone Wolf. She&#39;s after Cedric.&#34;C</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Eight hundred million to get Cedric? So soon after Doug died? Is she that obsessed with Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian agreed. &#34;She couldn&#39;t have him before, and now with money, she&#39;s hell-bent on getting him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed lightly. &#34;And the second revelation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l tracked Joyce&#39;s finances and discovered she funded Alexander&#39;s plastic surgery. There were multiple payments between them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded as she listened. &#34;Given what Alexander revealed yesterday, everything adds up.Joyce is desperate for Cedric, while Alexander...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian added eagerly, &#34;He&#39;s interested in you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused to take another sip of water. &#34;So,what&#39;s the third thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression turned serious, her brow furrowing. &#34;The identity of the Lone Wolf&#39;s leader remains a mystery, but our findings suggest their frequent activities in Olisvine. Interestingly, although their forces surround our villa, they don&#39;t appear to be threatening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow.&#34;How so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan explained, &#34;Their actions don&#39;t suggest they want to harm you. It&#39;s almost as if they&#39;re here to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian shared his confusion. Historically, Daniela&#39;s group and the Lone Wolf had been adversaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their leadership changed abruptly five years ago and they seemed to dissolve, leading everyone to believe the Lone Wolf had disbanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they resurfaced out of nowhere, accepted Joyce&#39;s eight hundred million, and yet they remain inactive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Ryan an instruction. &#34;Investigate further. Return to the office and dig up whatever you can about the Lone Wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare for Daniela to feel this curious about anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked in just as Daniela uttered &#34;Lone Wolf.&#34;He paused briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What wolf?&#34; Cedric asked, stepping into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian exited. Daniela offered a warm smile. &#34;For the time being,avoid returning to Phillips Group. I&#39;ve instructed the secretary to transfer your belongings to Elite Lux.You&#39;ll be sharing an office with me from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was clearly delighted with the arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later at the office, Daniela powered up her computer to delve into the Lone Wolf&#39;s background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she logged in, a loud cry disrupted the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice came through, apologetic. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,but without an appointment, Ms. Harper is unavailable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp slap resonated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s furious tone filled the air, &#34;Nina! Have you lost your senses? Your sister is in deep trouble, and this is your attitude? It seems like you take pleasure in her suffering.I swear I will make you regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of slapping echoed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian rushed outside and helped Nina off the floor. Nina stepped aside with her face covered, shot a scornful look at Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you resort to violence at Elite Lux? Elyse Dury, don&#39;t you respect Ms. Harper at all? This is unacceptable!&#34; Lillian spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse straightened her attire. &#34;Where&#39;s Daniela? I&#39;m not speaking to anyone else. I need to see Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian folded her arms. &#34;She&#39;s occupied at the moment and cannot meet with anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s anxiety spiked instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had turned from a well-known socialite to someone universally scorned. Without Daniela&#39;s help,her life would be ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was a married man, and Joyce had been causing chaos online, further tarnishing Natalie&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s tearful face only fueled public disdain for Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The backlash was severe. People were so repulsed they pelted Natalie with eggs in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Natalie withstand this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Daniela&#39;s aunt! You have no right to block me!&#34;Elyse exclaimed loudly, her desperation clear. She believed her and Natalie&#39;s suffering justified their demands on others&#39; empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, hearing the commotion, set her computer aside and instructed, &#34;Let her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, adjusting her hair, stormed into Daniela&#39;s office, casting a threatening look at Nina.&#34;You&#39;ll regret this once I&#39;m done here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering, Elyse noticed Cedric at another desk,deeply engrossed in his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snorted through her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wouldn&#39;t have lost her mind if it hadn&#39;t been for this troublesome man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all started because of Cedric!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fierce glare at Cedric, she made her way towards Daniela.</p>
