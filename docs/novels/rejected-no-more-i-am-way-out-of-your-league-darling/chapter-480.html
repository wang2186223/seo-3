                <p>Elyse clung to a sliver of hope when it came to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Linden? He&#39;s never been married.And no matter what, Daniela is still family. If you marry him.she won&#39;t just leave you with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes. &#34;So I&#39;m supposed to bet my future on her goodwill? Depend on her charity and tiptoe around her moods? Why shouldI?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out a weary sigh. &#34;If you go for Doug,you better brace yourself. Joyce won&#39;t just step aside.She&#39;s not the type to let things slide. Last time,a woman flirted with Doug, and Joyce handled it by carving &#39;bitch&#39; into her face. Think you can deal with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed. &#34;Joyce? She&#39;s not even worth a second thought. Daniela&#39;s tricky,sure,but Joyce?Please.&#34; A smirk played on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...&#34; Elyse hesitated, pressing her lips together.&#34;Is your mind made up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded firmly. &#34;I&#39;m done being someone&#39;s pawn.Daniela already knows what happened to Brylee.If we don&#39;t find a powerful ally, we&#39;ll be dead sooner or later-or worse,locked away like Caiden. We need to act before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chewed on her lower lip. &#34;Natalie, maybe we should just let this go,&#34; she murmured, the fear of losing her daughter gnawing at her. &#34;I&#39;ll confess everything to Daniela. I&#39;ll get on my knees if I have to -beg her to forgive us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a sharp laugh. &#34;Her mother&#39;s dead-your apology means nothing. And from where I&#39;m standing, Daniela&#39;s already decided to wipe us out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse fell into silence, her gaze dark and calculating.&#34;If I tell Daniela who&#39;s really behind it all, do you think she&#39;d let us go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head. &#34;They&#39;re too powerful. Not even Daniela can take them on. If we cross both sides,we&#39;re finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse lowered her gaze,releasing a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the office, the surveillance system broadcasted every word of Elyse and Natalie&#39;s conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden clenched his jaw, rage twisting his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shameless woman! She was already his,yet she had the audacity to consider another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d rather be someone&#39;s mistress than be his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she have no regard for his pride at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious beyond words, Linden turned to Daniela. &#34;We  at most can&#39;t let Natalie seduce Doug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, was casually testing out a beta game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, she said calmly, &#34;Linden, if you want to keep a woman, you need skills. I gave you the chance. She&#39;s already slept with you, yet she still doesn&#39;t want you. That&#39;s on you, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through Linden. He had always assumed Daniela would have his back-he never expected her to abandon him so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t this concern you too? If Natalie secures a stronger ally, she&#39;ll be even harder to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a slow, mocking chuckle. &#34;Linden,don&#39;t waste your breath. Elyse and Natalie? They&#39;re nothing but clowns to me. Even if they latched onto ten men like Doug, I still wouldn&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden knew she meant every word. He just refused to accept it. He had counted on using Daniela&#39;s power to bring Natalie to heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re incredibly powerful.&#34; Linden dropped to his knees, keeping his sharp gaze lowered. &#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m begging for your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance at him, her focus still on her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp crack of gunfire from her game filled the office. &#34;Linden, if you want something, go earn it yourself.&#34;  Linden&#39;s whole body tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came Daniela&#39;s cold laugh. &#34;All bark, no bite. 1don&#39;t keep dogs that won&#39;t bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s head snapped up at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression was frozen,unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, it hit him-he wasn&#39;t Ryan or Lillian.Daniela protected her own fiercely, but he wasn&#39;t part of that inne circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, he didn&#39;t even come close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden backed out of her office, his gaze dark with murderous intent as he stared into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wanted to be part of Daniela&#39;s world, he needed to prove himself-with an act she couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Natalie and Elyse? They would be his offering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina brushed past Linden,catching the chilling rage in his eyes. Her stomach twisted with unease, and she quickly knocked on Daniela&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, my sister&#39;s asking to borrow money. Should I lend it to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, still engrossed in her game, replied casually,&#34;Up to you.&#34; She never meddled in other people&#39;s affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from my mom and Natalie-they&#39;re going to  the charity auction tonight and need a custom dress worth half a million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smnirked. &#34;So Natalie&#39;s playing the elegant temptress,hoping to reel Doug in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, eyes still on her game, let out a light laugh.&#34;Obviously. She needs a plan to snatch Doug away and shove Joyce out of the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina,standing nearby, had no clue what they were scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t matter. Whatever Daniela decided was right-no questions needed. Instead, she simply asked.&#34;Daniela, should I lend them the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Yes, lend it. I&#39;ll send you the five hundred grand-hand it over to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s grin widened. &#34;Natalie&#39;s diving straight into the fire-seducing Doug means stepping on Joyce&#39;s lifeline,and Joyce won&#39;t just stand by. Meanwhile.Linden&#39;s losing his mind because she&#39;d rather chase a thrice-married man than pick him. Three people, one battleground-this is going to be fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft,amused laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pieces clicked into place for Nina, and she gave Daniela an approving thumbs-up. &#34;Genius. You&#39;re just sitting back and enjoying the fireworks!&#34; Daniela&#39;s smile deepened as she turned to Lillian.&#34;Come with me tonight. We&#39;ll watch the show firsthand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina straightened. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m coming too. AndI&#39;ll personally fund Natalie&#39;s five hundred grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s fists tightened. &#34;I want that money to be the nail in Natalie&#39;s coffin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twisted with pure hatred, a darkness so stark that Daniela took a second look.</p>
