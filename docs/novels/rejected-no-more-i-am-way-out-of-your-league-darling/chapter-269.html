                <p>Joyce discovered that the favoritism she once believed in was merely an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thls epiphany rendered her previous decision to walk away almost comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed so intensely that tears cascaded down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she laughed, Daniela and Alexander turned around, drawn by the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tightening her grip on her scarf, Joyce inhaled deeply and straightened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then draped the scarf around her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She affirmed to herself that a man incapable of loving her was unworthy of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the scarf securely in place, Joyce approached Daniela and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, looking bewildered, watched as Joyce confidently linked her arm through his. With a superficial smile, she asked, &#34;Why haven&#39;t you left yet? What were you discussing with my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile, though faint and unconvincing, did not reach her eyes, hinting at the coldness behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Daniela, Joyce said, &#34;I need a moment more with Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a brief nod and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander made to follow Daniela, yearning for a response to his earlier confessions, but Joyce obstructed his path. &#34;Don&#39;t waste youur time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander faced her, irritation sharp in his voice. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce offered a wry smile, the warmth of the scarf around her neck contrasting with the coolness of her demeanor. She adjusted the scart casuafly and warned, &#34;Alezander, no matter your bellets or whether Daniela ends her relatlonship with Calden, she remains my sister. Our marriage is still legafly valid, and should you pursue anything with her, just a few tears from me in public could wreak havoc on Bennett Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled dryly, her laugh piercing the tense alr. &#34;After all, is there anything more scandalous than you having an affair with your sister-in-law, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened, his eyes narrowing. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&#34; Joyce retorted, her voice calm yet detached. &#34;What do I have to lose? I don&#39;t rely on you,Alexander. But do you dare to take that risk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, her tone quietly menacing.&#34;Are you willing to risk Bennett Group&#39;s future against me?Perhaps you should proceed. Maybe Daniela will be touched by your persistence and forgive you eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms and flashed him a cold, mocking smile.′′SO,what&#39;s your decision? Your business empire or the beauty? Choose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t wait for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before walking away, she turned sharply, her voice firm and decisive. &#34;I don&#39;t consent to a divorce. You&#39;re welcome to file if you wish, but be ready to lose everything. I&#39;ve realized I quite enjoy being your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she let out a wild, almost unhinged laugh before turning and walking back to the villa. Her eyes were cold,her expression resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t have a happy life, they might as well be miserable together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, Joyce&#39;sultimatum-&#34;yoour business empire or the beauty&#34;-resonating in his mind like a deafening roar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated Joyce would take such drastic steps, placing herself yet again as an obstacle between him and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on Daniela as she walked away, and his hand slowly clenched into a tight fist. That same day, Joyce packed her belongings and left. When Katrina inquired about her actions, Joyce declared she wasn&#39;t seeking a divorce. She intended to endure this marriage for the rest of their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Daniela was in the living room. Joyce&#39;s gaze fixed on her throughout the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,however,showed no reaction, making it unclear whether she had heard it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce grabbed her suitcase, ready to depart, yet paused, reflecting briefly before setting it back down. She approached Daniela and stood next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve decided not to divorce Alexander. What do you think about that?&#34; Joyce felt a twinge of fear towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,invaluable for her connections, was like a treasure trove of opportunities. Joyce was aware of Daniela&#39;s influence,having witnessed powerful men submit to her at Elite Lux with utter obedience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she angered Daniela, and Daniela chose to reclaim the roboticscompany shares, Caiden wouldn&#39;t be able to retrieve them a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Daniela&#39;s financial support, Joyce questioned how she could possibly challenge the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, engrossed in a report, seemed not to hear Joyce initially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Joyce, prompting her to repeat her statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reply came flatly. &#34;It&#39;s up to you. Why are you telling me? I&#39;m not your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Joyce&#39;s mother, observing the exchange, narrowed her eyes at Daniela, suspecting an ulterior motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike her mother, who possessed keen instincts, Joyce simply offered a tentative smile to Daniela. &#34;I felt l should consult you. Without the support from the robotics firm, what else can I count on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing the futility of any deception in front of Daniela, Joyce let go of any facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she concluded, her phone chimed with a notification. She made no move to check her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her chin slightly and asked, &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to check that?&#34;</p>
