                <p>Daniela emerged from the building and noticed Ryan and Lillian at the entrance, their faces clouded with discontent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, wearing a grin, strolled up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught by the sight of the pair who looked as rigid as statues, Daniela raised an eyebrow at Cedric and queried, &#34;What&#39;s up with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a chuckle, Cedric shrugged nonchalantly. &#34;Oh, them? Just two goofballs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had barely resumed their drive when the driver turned towards Daniela wvith a concerned expression.&#34;| think we&#39;re being followed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing behind, Daniela&#39;s eyes quickly identified Alexander&#39;s car, a vehicle she knew all too well from days filled with unrequited affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere glimpse of his car used to send her heart into joyful flips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of cool indifference, Daniela remarked,&#34;Just pay him no mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need me to take care of it?&#34; Cedric offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; Daniela stated firmly/. &#34;Don&#39;t waste your energy on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander persisted in his pursuit all the way to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arrival, he burst from his car, urgency etched on his face. &#34;Daniela, we need to speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a brief nod, Daniela replied, &#34;Alright, get on with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp glance at Cedric, Alexander silently conveyed his desire for him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Daniela, who stated crisply,are you going to speak up or not? Because if you aren&#39;t, I&#39;m heading back inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tolerance for Alexander was wearing thin. &#34;Yes,&#34; Alexander responded, his voice tinged with unease. As Daniela pivoted to leave, he reached out,grasping her arm. &#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t have it both ways-spending time with Cedric while you&#39;re seeing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned to one of surprise at his accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First off, whatever&#39;s happening between Cedric and me isn&#39;t your damn concern. And Alexander, wvhat makes you think I&#39;m seeing you? Besides, do you honestly think you&#39;re someoneI&#39;d consider?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sour expression, Alexander shot back, &#34;You once told me I could treat you well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, her laugh echoing with derision. &#34;You&#39;re really adept at embarrassing yourself. I told you that you could be kind, and that as an adult, you&#39;re responsible for your own actions.I have no interest in managing your fantasies. Don&#39;t let your imagination get the better of you-it will only lead to disappointment. And weren&#39;t you completely smitten with Joyce? You divorced me to be with her. can&#39;t fathom why, now that you&#39;re both unattached,you aren&#39;t pursuing her. Why come here to hassle me in the dead of night? Tell me, why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dripped with scorn and mockery, each word more pointed than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused, his fists clenched, a surge of frustration building within him. &#34;I don&#39;t care for Joyce anymore. Daniela, would you ever think about giving me a shot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle, clearly entertained.&#34;It&#39;s not entirely out of the question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words left her mouth, Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed, a sharp contraction of his pupils betraying his shock. He swiveled his head to gaze at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ecstatic, Alexander couldn&#39;t contain himself and blurted out, &#34;You mean it?&#34; Bursting with enthusiasm, he moved forward, nudging Cedric aside without a second thought. &#34;Daniela, is this true? You actually want to be with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, almnost bitter smile, Daniela tilted her head slightly. &#34;After all the time l&#39;ve spent pursuing you, it would be a waste if I didn&#39;t at least consider your change of heart, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained impassive as Alexander,brimming with joy, eagerly agreed, &#34;Yes, exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lillian and Ryan observed from the sidelines, their faces mirroring their confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, usually so composed and astute, stood a short distance away, his hands balling into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under normal circumstances, he might have discerned the lack of sincerity in Daniela&#39;s smile and realized the truth behind her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, overwhelmed by emotion, he was far from his usual calm self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crushing weight settled in his chest, his mind spinning in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I swear I have no feelings for Joyce anymore.If you doubt me, I&#39;ll prove it to you right now.&#34; Not bothering to think twice, Alexander hastily dialed Joyce&#39;s number, eagerly setting his phone to speaker as it began to ring.</p>
