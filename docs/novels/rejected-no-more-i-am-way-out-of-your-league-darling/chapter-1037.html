                <p>A little grin tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips as she glanced at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>C</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for it, planning to mention to Nikolas that Carol was playing online games, when Hamilton&#39;s voice suddenly cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, listen, the hailstorm out here is brutal.There&#39;s no way I can make it back. All the roads are closed. Double-check that every window and door is shut tight. I tried calling Cedric, but he&#39;s not picking up.If you see him, tell him to call me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could answer, Hamilton&#39;s voice grew sharp and loud. &#34;For heaven&#39;s sake! Nikolas, I&#39;m on the phone! Can&#39;t you just hold on a minute? Daniela-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the walls, wind battered the house, shrieking down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s attention lingered on the television, half-lístening as Hamilton rambled, every so often giving a quiet&#34;mm′′or&#34;okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a child, she had yearned for someone older to fuss over her, but ever since her mother&#39;s death, no one had filled that space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela? Are you paying attention?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to reality, Daniela answered, &#34;I&#39;m here. I heard you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a shadow darted across the window,catching her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of suspicion narrowed Daniela&#39;s gaze. She quickly said, &#34;I&#39;ll call you back. Got to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Hamilton&#39;s words were cut short as the call dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an exasperated huff, he flung the phone at Nikolas. &#34;Great! This is on you! Why the hurry? What&#39;s so earth-shattering about your love life? Is it more important than a pregnant woman&#39;s safety? Now I&#39;ve lost the call-wonderful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, something unsettled him. &#34;Hold on.Daniela&#39;s voice didn&#39;t sound right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had sensed it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exchanging a glance,both men bolted from the house,braving the pounding hail without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the driveway, the storm had left even expensive cars battered and useless. Only the delivery van stood a chance against the relentless ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They dove into the battered van and sped off toward Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other McCoy family members tried shouting warnings from upstairs, but the hail hammered so loudly that every word was swallowed up. Meanwhile, inside the villa, Daniela kept her grip steady around the neck of a king cobra. She had just gotten to her feet when the front door crashed open with a bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stopped dead in his tracks, the sight before him stealing the air from his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurried up, calling, &#34;Dad, what&#39;s the holdup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words died instantly as his eyes took in the sight before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the floor, a swarm of king cobras gided,their tongues flicking, tails rattling with a warning that raised the hairs on his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood as if rooted to the spot, every muscle locked tight with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt his own blood run cold. He&#39;d seen snakes like these on nature shows-deadly, fast, and nearly always fatal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bite and that could be the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding one of the cobras just behind the head,Daniela glanced over at the men. &#34;Why did you both come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton barely managed a response,voice quivering.&#34;W-we got worried. Thought we&#39;d check on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Daniela understood-Hamilton must have picked up on her tone right before she hung up. As cold blue eyes fixed on the men with unsettling calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing to fuss about. Just a few snakes, that&#39;s all.&#34; Daniela glanced at their drained faces and cautioned, &#34;A handful are still loose. Best not to move from the doorway, or they&#39;ll head your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded so fast it looked painful. &#34;We&#39;re staying put.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squeezed his eyes shut, swallowing his pride.&#34;Carol...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning, Carol put another snake in the basket.&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no pretending in a moment like this. Voice unsteady, Nikolas admitted, &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>。</p>
