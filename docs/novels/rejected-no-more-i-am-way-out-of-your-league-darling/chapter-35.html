                <p>The slap was just about to land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned, ready to react, when suddenly someone stepped in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood Cedric, shielding her decisively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering and formidable,his presence sliced through the tension, exuding an undeniable command that seemed to stabilize the chaos around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, perplexed yet oddly reassured, remained motionless, her eyes drifting downward to notice Cedric&#39;s other hand, balled into a firm fist at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s fury escalated, his hand frozen in the air,quivering with wrath as he shot a venomous look towards Cedric. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric returned his gaze, his eyes cold and unwavering.&#34;And what do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice soared in volume, tinged with defiance.&#34;I&#39;m disciplining my own daughter. Must you meddle in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela stepped from behind Cedric,her fingers lightly grasping his sleeve. She nodded towards the security camera perched above them and spoke to Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re eager to make headlines tomorrow, feel free to take a swing. But I&#39;m curious-what do you suppose the news will declare? Will it be-Elite Lux&#39;s CEO&#39;s Estranged Father Makes a Violent Entrance,Tries to Steal from His Own Daughter? Or maybe-Disgraced Father Strikes His Own Flesh and Blood in Defense of His Second Wife? And with the recent news about that fire, Dad, don&#39;t you believe this whole ordeal would be a hot topic for the media?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt as if he were teetering on the brink of insanity. His entire frame trembled as a raw, anguished roar escaped him. &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained upright,her smile sugary and teasing.&#34;Yes,Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sensed that if he didn&#39;t exit soon,he would just burst from unrestrained anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Daniela, if you choose to be this cold, this cruel, clutching at your precious wealth, then don&#39;t bother seeking my aid when you find yourself desperate one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved her hand. &#34;Of course, Dad. Be careful as you leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, cheeks aflame with anger, stormed out without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stole a quick glance at Cedric, who remained silent,standing loyally by Daniela&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, ever the embodiment of a graceful stepmother when others were present, softened her voice. &#34;Daniela, such youthful innocence. You haven&#39;t yet felt the profound burdens of parenthood. With time, when you have kids, you&#39;ll see that preserving family unity is the ultimate endeavor. Riches,celebrity,and authority-they vanish like morning mist. I dearly hope you won&#39;t live to regret today&#39;s choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a playful snort, her lipscurling into an amused smile. &#34;The prospect of motherhood isn&#39;t on my agenda this lifetime. And trust me, if I ever ventured down that path, I wouldn&#39;t follow in Caiden&#39;s footsteps. Yes, I confess-fame and power do catch my fancy. Just a heads-up, steer clear of myfinances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s mask of composure cracked. Realizing her soft-spoken manipulations were ineffective, her face momentarily tightened in frustration before she regained her poise. After a lingering,poignant glance at Cedric, she let out a resigned sigh, turned gracefully,and made her exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, arms folded in mock defiance, turned her attention to Joyce, who was still planted in the same spot, obviously torn about leaving. Daniela&#39;s eyes twinkled mischievously as she teased, &#34;Hanging around, Joyce? Not ready to make your exit? Do you fancy yourself as royalty, perhaps expecting a grand procession?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt the urge to walk away from Daniela&#39;s taunts,yet hesitation kept her standing still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still here. Leaving now could just give this woman the perfect opportunity to steal Cedric&#39;s attention. Daniela was well-versed in the art of seduction,after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, Cedric had just said he had a lunch appointment with Daniela. This could also serve as an opportune moment to deepen her connections with him. She couldn&#39;t help but imagine marrying him one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced at Cedric with renewed interest. &#34;Mr.Phillips, are you planning to head to lunch soon?Could I perhaps accompany you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce angled her head, giving her eyelashes a flirtatious flutter, hoping to charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a playful pout, and she implored in a sweet, coaxing tone, &#34;Please? Can I join you for</p>
