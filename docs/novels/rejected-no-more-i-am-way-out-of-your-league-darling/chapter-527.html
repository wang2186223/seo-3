                <p>Richard paused, considering his words. &#34;The power of the National Commerce Association can obliterate anything in their way. Even the media agrees-standing against them is like standing against the entire world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;Oh, that does sound impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard dabbed at his forehead, his confusion deepening as he sudied Daniela. This wasn&#39;t the reaction he expected. Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard hesitated, searching for the right words. After everything he had said, Daniela remained unfazed.Finally, he asked, &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed. &#34;As I said earlier, Lillian has already passed along your message from yesterday. As for the association, it doesn&#39;t concern me much. My future plans remain confidential, and I&#39;m not at liberty to discuss them. If there&#39;s nothing else,I have another meeting to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stood still, momentarily stunned. After all his effort, was Daniela really brushing himn off so easily? &#34;Daniela, listen. You&#39;re young and don&#39;t grasp how serious this is. This association isn&#39;t something to take lightly. You can&#39;t just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Lillian stepped in and led him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard found himself standing outside Elite Lux,shoulders slumped in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Daniela so impossibly stubborn? Just because her company had some success didn&#39;t mean she could let it go to her head. When trouble camne,she would have no choice but to rely on Alexander to clean up her mess. And Cedric? He was just a man who indulged in luxury, living for pleasure without a care for responsibility. He was nothing compared to Alexander-pragmatic, forward-thinking, and always considerate. Alexander was a hundred times the man Cedric would ever be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these thoughts, Richard turned on his heel and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even reached home when he saw Hackett already waiting at his doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stepped out of his car, tension rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, exuding authority, wasted no time. &#34;What did Daniela say?&#34; Richard hesitated,pressing his lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a cold laugh. &#34;So, I wasted my time coming here? I thought Daniela would actually listen to you, but it seems I gave you too much credit. Since that&#39;s the case, I won&#39;t hold back anymore. I&#39;ve already united over five thousand top enterprises across the country to impose sanctions on Daniela and Elite Lux. Richard, I have just one question for you.Are you standing with Daniela against us, or will you join us to bring her down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard mustered a weak smile. &#34;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit excessive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s lips curved slightly, but his eyes stayed ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard cast his gaze downward. &#34;How about give me a little time? I&#39;ll have Alexander talk to Daniela. You don&#39;t want an all-out war either, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was clear to Richard. Elite Lux wasn&#39;t some minor company-if it were, Hackett wouldn&#39;t be so persistent. Even for the association, crushing Daniela wouldn&#39;t be without consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is headstrong, and I&#39;m not the best at convincing her. Let my son handle it,&#34; Richard added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett locked eyes with Richard, his voice like steel.&#34;You have three days. No more, no less. If I don&#39;t see  Elite Lux&#39;s application to join the association by then,I&#39;ll take it as a declaration of war. And when that happens, don&#39;t expect mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned on his heel and left, heading back to the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held a meeting with the members of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett, what exactly are you afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! Why are you cutting Daniela so much slack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just push her out of the domestic market entirely.Make her pack up and go. Isn&#39;t that the simplest solution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;ve gone soft, Hackett. You&#39;re not the same as when you dealt with Brylee back in the day.Back then, you were decisive and ruthless. But now,when it comes to her daughter, you&#39;re hesitating?&#34;</p>
