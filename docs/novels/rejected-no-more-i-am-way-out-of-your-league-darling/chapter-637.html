            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;l&#39;ve gone over it countless times. I designed the security system at my villa myself-there shouldn&#39;t have been any weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was calm, steady-too steady. It was as if she were narrating a stranger&#39;s tragedy, not her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Josie knew better. She had spent three years cooking for Daniela, watching her every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Daniela had confided in her, sharing both her joys and heartaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Josie understood-the quiet fury buried beneath Daniela&#39;s unshaken exterior ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite it all, Daniela went on. &#34;And yet, somneone managed to plant such a powerful bomb in my home.Who do you think could have done that? I don&#39;t remember much from before. But someone told me you practically raised Cedric-treated him like your own son. You must have been looking forward to his child&#39;s arrival, weren&#39;t you? I also heard that when your son struggled to find work, it was Cedric who took him under his wing, taught him,helped him stand on his own. Later, I personally gave him a promising project-the very one that turned him into the boss people admire today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s tears spilled over, unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Back then, danger was everywhere.But I believed my home was safe. I trusted the people around me. And yet, in the one place I thought was secure, I lost my child. Josie, why do you think that happened? Is trust never enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s head shook violently as sobs wracked her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Alexander narrowed his eyes,watching intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, just in time to hear Daniela&#39;s next words. &#34;The doctor said I might never be able to have children again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she said it, the entire world seemed to go stilL.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s sobs stopped mid-breath. She stared,frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, too, came to an abrupt halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face betrayed nothing as she rose to her feet. &#34;So,this is what trusting others too much gets you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned and walked away. With a heavy thud, Josie dropped to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, she bent forward, forehead touching the floor as she wailed, &#34;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m so sorry! I betrayed your trust. I had no choice! They forced me!They threatened my son&#39;s life-I had no choice! I&#39;ve been trying to make it right ever since,I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands clasped together in desperate prayer, she pleaded between sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers murmured, unsure of what they were witnessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained rooted to the spot, hearing nothing except Daniela&#39;s words, echoing in his mind.&#34;The doctor said I might never be able to have children again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went home with mixed feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Daniela can&#39;t have children anymore?&#34;Richard&#39;s face drained of color, his shock palpable.&#34;That&#39;s impossible! You must have misheard! She was pregnant with Cedric&#39;s child before. How could she suddenly be unable to conceive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ran a hand through his hair, frustration tightening his chest. &#34;She said it herself. You know Daniela-she doesn&#39;t joke about things like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s response was instant and cold. &#34;That&#39;s  unacceptable. A woman who can&#39;t bear children?Absolutely not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander groaned, raking his fingers through his hair.&#34;What the hell am I supposed to do? I gave up once -I won&#39;t do it again. I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s glare was sharp, unyielding. &#34;And then what?Who will inherit the family business? If you choose Daniela, that&#39;s the end of the Bennett name. I won&#39;t allow it. Never!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Richard had been Daniela&#39;s biggest supporter.Now,he was her fiercest opposition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, a woman&#39;s worth was measured by her ability to bear children and carry on the family name.Without that, what purpose did she serve in his world?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, listen to me. Don&#39;t be reckless. You&#39;re a man of power now-you don&#39;t need Daniela. Find a woman who can give you heirs. I want a grandson. If you choose Daniela, you&#39;ll lose my blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s head dropped, but his jaw tightened in defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman who haunted his thoughts, his dreams,was finally within reach. And now they expected him to walk away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over something like this? Not a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was his. No matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, father and son clashed. Voices were raised,doors slammed. In the end,Alexander packed his bags and left-choosing solitude at his office in Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even as he left, the weight of it all sat heavy in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a man of old-fashioned values, and in many ways, he saw eye to eye with Richard. To him,a woman&#39;s role was to bear children and shape the next generation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there were no children to inherit his legacy, then what was the point of all his struggles?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,all of it felt hollow-empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of emotions tore through Alexander,leaving him restless and aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter part of him blamed Daniela for not taking better care of herself, for putting him in this impossible position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie walked back to Cedric&#39;s home, her thoughts a tangled mess. Cedric stood by the kitchen counter.tlipping</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a cookbook, lost in concentration</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie stepped inside. her gaze drifting to Cedri profile,her mind swirling with thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If fate had been kinder, that child would be tugging at Cedric&#39;s sleeve, calling him&#34;Dad&#34; by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric moved across the kitchen,his limp making him look less like the strong, dignified man he once was and more like someone carrying the weight of unseen wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past three years had been nothing but an endless cycle of pain, one that never let up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie clung to the belief that by taking care of Cedric,she could somehow atone for what she had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with Daniela tearing through the fragile peace she had built, Josie found herself unable to stay composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had broken the faith Cedric had placed in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still recall the day Daniela came back after the divorce-how Cedric had personally asked her to look after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, he had said, &#34;Josie, my girl has finally come home. Please take care of her for me. She never had a mother&#39;s warmth and doesn&#39;t trust easily. If you watch over her, she&#39;ll come to love you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she had let him down in the worst way possible.</p>
