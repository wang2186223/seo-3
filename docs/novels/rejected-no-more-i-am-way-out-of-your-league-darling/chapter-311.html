                <p>Caiden stood frozen, his eyes narrowing as he shot a frosty glare at Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she have to push Daniela&#39;s buttons? Wasn&#39;t she just inviting disaster upon herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hours ticked by as the night grew darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric led Daniela back.to their bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comforting familiarity of the room eased Daniela&#39;s tension little by little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric settled down across from her, hoIding out a glass of water. Daniela simply shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft sigh, he set the glass down, his attention returning to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t really paying attention. My mind was elsewhere, and I didn&#39;t notice Joyce&#39;s actions. Then you came downstairs. You got upset, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head again but then gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled slightly. &#34;You&#39;re upset with Joyce, not me, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that name brought a flicker of anger to Daniela&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric reached for Daniela&#39;s hand and cleaned it with a wet wipe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle myself. I just wasn&#39;t paying attention earlier. Don&#39;t let it upset you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was gentle, almost like calming a child. &#34;But it bothers me too-it hurts right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided Daniela&#39;s hand to rest over his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She observed him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight streaming through the tall window softened Cedric&#39;s sharp features. Daniela noticedher own reflection mirrored in his steady gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cedric spoke, his voice steady. &#34;Daniela, I love you. I always will. You don&#39;t need to worry about anyone else. I&#39;H keep myself safe, and you can have anything pure and real from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face softened, the anger fading and replaced by a calm, deeper longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we get some rest now?&#34; Cedric suggested, patting Daniela&#39;s hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched down to grab the glass from the floor, planning to set it on the table. But just as he reached for it, a hand grippedhis wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over, and before he could fully process what was happening, something soft grazed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft,tender warmth brushed against him, stirring something deep within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt his heart soften, almost,melting at the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he let Daniela&#39;s hesitant kiss continue, but her soft, impatient sounds made him chuckle before he leaned in to return the gesture fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before his laughter faded, overtaken by a deep, smoldering desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept the glass in one hand while his other arm wrapped around Daniela&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, she had always held back, and Cedric never pressured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He allowed her to set the pace for everything between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would always give in to whatever she desired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when his desire for her burned fiercely, he&#39;d cool off with a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a feeling she was holding something back, or maybe she was leaving him a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t understand why she thought he needed that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t. He never wanted an escape. But because it mattered to her, he went along with it without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as Daniela&#39;s hands reached for the buttons of Cedric&#39;s shirt, his expression turned serious in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled away slightly, his voice soft yet firm. &#34;Is this just a fleeting moment, or are you sure of what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his question, she continued to undo his buttons, drawing closer for another kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34; Cedric&#39;s-voice was gentle, laced with a touch of self-awareness. Though he couldn&#39;t deny the excitement building within him, a part of him wrestled with doubt, wondering if he was somehow overstepping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small voice of reason urged him to pause, and so he called her name, seeking reassurance before moving any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela ignored him. She focused on the buttons again but soon grew frustrated and looked up at Cedric with a silent, pleading gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do it yourself.&#34; Her voice was gentle and enticing. Cedric&#39;s hand shook slightly around the glass,droplets of water falling onto his arm like little sparks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drops felt strangely hot against his skin. He could no longer control himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips curved into a playful smile as he looked at her. &#34;You&#39;re quite the demanding one, aren&#39;t you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too lazy to undress me yourself, so now l&#39;ve got to handle it all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were tinged with faint redness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, she focused on his buttons again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart raced, a dizzying feeling washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of this moment seemed to pull him in, intoxicating and irresistible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fumbled with the shirt for what seemed like an eternity, and Cedric couldn&#39;t tell whether it was frustrating her or himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he placed his hand over hers, meeting her gaze. &#34;If you regret this later, I won&#39;t feel bad. But right now,all I want is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Daniela closed the distance and kissed him once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Cedric deepened the kiss, matching her intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they pulled back, breathless and dazed, Daniela whispered, &#34;I like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked, completely taken aback, his mind racing to process her boldness.</p>
