                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s aircraft soared into the sky an hour later,leaving the familiar landscapes of the country far below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained seated quietly in the opulent cabin,her eyes cast downward in contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, she surmised that the headlines and buzz in Olisvine were likely ablaze with the leaked audio and the footage of the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had delivered the response Alexander had been pressing for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that point forward, their connection was severed -no obligations, no bonds, absolutely nothing lingered between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,back at the headquarters of Phillips Group,the oppressive silence in the boardroom shattered with an unexpected knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives whipped their heads around, eyes wide with disbelief at the boldness of the secretary daring to disturb the solemnity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the memory was still fresh of the previous secretary who had interrupted Cedric Phillips&#39; meeting,now enduring a bleak reassignment in Antarctica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the executives silently sent their condolences to the unfortunate soul, the secretary confidently closed the distance to the stoic Cedric and whispered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; A flicker of relief passed over Cedric&#39;s usually rigid expression, a rare smile breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room of executives fell into stunned silence,unable to utter a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm nod, the secretary confirmed,&#34;Yes, Mr.Phillips. They&#39;ve completed the divorce proceedings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of curiosity surged through the room, stirring the appetites of the executives who thrived on company gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Divorce? Who got divorced? What in the world was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric abruptly stood and declared, &#34;That concludes today&#39;s meeting. Kevin, arrange the next flight out to Elite Lux for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent, shock etching the faces of the executives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric left, an executive, driven by a blend of confusion and curiosity, reached out and grasped Kevin&#39;s arm. &#34;This is unprecedented! A five-minute meeting? Where is Mr. Phillips off to so urgently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, Kevin responded, &#34;If everything goes as planned, Mr. Phillips will be walking down the aisle in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung in the air, leaving a trail of astonishment among the listeners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,I love Alexander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was behind that fire! I instructed someone to douse the place with gasoline, and I was the one who set it ablaze. I intended to ruin your wedding to Alexander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if you&#39;re Dad&#39;s biological daughter? Anything you own, I&#39;ll snatch it away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, does it even matter that you&#39;re Dad&#39;s biological child? Look at yourself, kneelng before me.And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do,Daniela? No one&#39;s going to believe you anyway!&#34;6</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wedding is just the start. By the time I&#39;m done,your whole life will be in shambles!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the hashtag #TruthOfTheBridelnFire skyrocketed to prominence on social media. Audio  clips mingled with visuals of a blazing inferno circulated rapidly across various platforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was in the midst of a high-stakes executive meeting between Bennett Group and Harper Group when the controversial video caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flurry of panic, she inadvertently pressed the play button, and instantly, her harsh and biting voice echoed through the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon realizing her blunder, she looked up to see over a hundred executives from both corporations fixed on her, their faces etched with loaded glares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s cheeks flushed a deep scarlet as she frantically waved her hands, exclaiming, &#34;That wasn&#39;t my voice! This is slander! It&#39;s a setup by Daniela to destroy my reputation.You see now-how malevolent she is! I&#39;m contacting the police immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, an in-depth professional analysis of the video and audio surfaced online. The findings confirmed that the audio and surveillance footage were indeed genuine, with no signs of alteration or manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This disclosure struck Joyce like a brutal reprimand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Alexander grasped the true implications of Daniela&#39;s earlier statement-people should pay the price for their mistakes. But the fallout was merciless-Joyce facedan online storm of hatred, her name dragged through the mud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! I&#39;ve never seen such audacity from a stepdaughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The audacity to make the real daughter kneel? I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s cruel or just plain ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And really, what gave Joyce the nerve to start a fire at her stepsister&#39;s wedding? So Daniela was the bride caught in the fire? All that slander, all those accusations, and now it&#39;s clear she did nothing wrong.How embarrassing for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s truly sad. After her mother&#39;s passing, Daniela has lost her father too. And let&#39;s be honest, would Joyce have dared such boldness if Caiden hadn&#39;t spoiled her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget Alexander! His own wife was unjustly blamed, yet he sided with the one who lit the fire.What&#39;s happening between Joyce and Alexander,anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Despicable man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the torrent of online vitriol continued, someone abruptly shared an image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Displayed was the divorce certificate of Alexander and Daniela.Underneath the photo, the consensus in the comments was clear. &#34;Justice is served!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander perused the trending topics on his smartphone, his expression turning thunderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forceful thud, he hurled the phone onto the table and barked at his secretary, &#34;What is the PR team even up to? Why wasn&#39;t I alerted before this scandal broke? These headlines have just splashed across the globe, and no one intervened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, with a lowered gaze, responded tentatively, &#34;Mr. Bennett, these topics surged unexpectedly. Our team is actively addressing it.It appears hackers instigated this, and we&#39;ve yet to neutralize it. The tech team is on it, and we anticipate a resolution shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scoffed bitterly. It would be resolved shortly? Not instantly, not immediately,but shortly?By that time, the whole nation had witnessed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve truly cornered me this time,&#34; he sneered under his breath, his anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she dared to cross the line like this, forgiveness would be a luxury she&#39;d never see from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for rejoining the Bennett family? She&#39;d better forget it-that door was slammed shut for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rage simmered to a boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He positioned himself by the panoramic window, his stare icy and piercing. His brows knit tightly together,his whole presence exuding a forbidding, frosty aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was on the verge of telling his secretary to call Daniela when his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of foreboding, Alexander answered the call, only to be greeted by a barrage of anger.&#34;Alexander! Has Daniela gone absolutely insane?Everyone is badgering me about whether you&#39;ve dumped Daniela to fool around with her stepsister!Where the hell is Daniela? I don&#39;t give a damn what you have to do-get those damn posts deleted now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice remained composed. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father, Richard Bennett, was far from pacified.&#34;Tell Daniela she&#39;s out of her goddamn mind if she thinks I&#39;ll ever forgive her for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call terminated with an abrupt click, leaving a heavier frown on Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Daniela had truly incited Richard&#39;s wrath. It seemed she was courting disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander resolved then and there that she was on her own. No more would he be her protector-not now,not ever. 12</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,Daniela had truly stirred up a storm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander attempted to call her, but it went to voice mail.</p>
