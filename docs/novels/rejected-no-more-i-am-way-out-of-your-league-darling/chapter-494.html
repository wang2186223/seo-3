                <p>Lately, Daniela hadn&#39;t been sleeping well, and her distress was evident on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina leaned in to whisper to Lillian, &#34;Do you know when Cedric is due back? Daniela can&#39;t go on like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela, who was absorbed in her phone,Lillian responded, &#34;Old habits die hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was left puzzled by her remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the day Cedric was due back from his trip,Daniela went to the airport to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The separation had been too much for her to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she waited at the terminal, the sight of Cedric filled her eyes with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence filled the car on the drive back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to swing by the office first.&#34; Cedric finally broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, his secretary glanced at Cedric. &#34;Mr.Phillips, there&#39;s no rush at the office today. It&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve been home. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to start there and deal with work tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his knees, Cedric replied tersely, &#34;There&#39;s an urgent meeting I must attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary opened his mouth to object but the tense air in the car stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela&#39;s phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a text from Russell. &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s a big new assignment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disinterested, Daniela was about to ignore it when another alert popped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s willing to pay big to have Cedric kidnapped. And this time, it&#39;s no small sum-a staggering five hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers flew across her phone keyboard.&#34;Who&#39;s the client?&#34; The mission was to abduct Cedric and take him to a specified location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell responded, &#34;Anonymous. It wasn&#39;t routed through HQ but a subsidiary. Alita wants to know if we should accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proceed,&#34; Daniela responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy two hundred million for us. And Cedric&#39;s drawing a huge bounty, five hundred million just to snatch him, no murder. Seems someone&#39;s really fixated on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell found humor in the situation, but Daniela was far from amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Cedric with someone else was unimaginable to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela&#39;s frequent messaging, the secretary gave Cedric a look, silently asking whether she would accompany them to the office or head home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together, showing a rare sight of timidity the secretary had never seen before. Cedric didn&#39;t particularly wish to avoid going home;his greater fear was that Daniela might confront him with a divorce agreement, a scenario he felt unprepared to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the airport, his first impulse was to flee upon seeing Daniela, yet he couldn&#39;t stand the thought of leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela glanced his way, Cedric tentatively suggested, &#34;Maybe we should head home first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting away her phone, Daniela replied, &#34;Weren&#39;t you supposed to return to your office? I&#39;mn free now;I could join you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face betrayed a tumult of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Is there a problem? Shouldn&#39;t I come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course, you should come,&#34; Cedric quickly responded, his voice eager. &#34;I&#39;d be glad for your company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell as Daniela returned her attention to her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arrival at Phillips Group, Daniela stepped out briskly, with Cedric a few paces behind. To an onlooker, Daniela might have appeared to be the CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, waiting for Cedric, who seemed reluctant to close the distance, making it feel as if she were leading a tour of the workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they entered his office, Cedric promptly locked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, his secretary rubbed his sore nose, the slight bump still lingering, and let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like the tension between them had finally eased, and they were back on better terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recent days had drained him; Cedric had been overworking himself, and the secretary had not slept in 48 hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, Cedric brewed a cup of coffee for Daniela before sitting down across from her. The skies outside mirrored the mood indoors, heavy and somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was grappling with feelings of injustice and the fear of losing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t there supposed to be a meeting?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; actually wanted to talk,&#34; Cedric replied. Evading the issue any longer was futile, especially since Daniela appeared prepared to address it, leaving no room for further avoidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to assume his typical negotiating posture, Cedric found himself unsettled by just one look at Daniela&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| need to be honest about that night at the charity gala. I did it on purpose. I apologize, Daniela,&#34; he said candidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged his admission with a nod,taking a sip of her coffee.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t my intention to cause you embarrassment. I was just feeling overwhelmed and unfortunately chose the most destructive way to provoke a reaction from you. We were both unhappy. I assure you, no matter what the future holds, I won&#39;t repeat such an action,&#34; Cedric expressed earnestly, his voice full of regret. &#34;I really missed you during my business trip, but I was too scared to reach out. Josie mentioned you&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping.guess it was my absence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, it was because you were gone,&#34; Daniela said straightforwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confirmation comforted Cedric, yet he restrained any burgeoning hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even pondered if Daniela valued him merely for the solace he provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such solace was easily replaceable. Daniela,with her charm, could easily attract countless admirers far and wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt his offerings were light in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The day I came to your office, I saw a document on your desk. What was it about?&#34; Cedric paused for a few seconds before finally asking, &#34;I caught the word &#39;agreement,&#39; but I didn&#39;t see the rest. What was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, Daniela responded, &#34;It&#39;s a divorce agreement.&#34;</p>
