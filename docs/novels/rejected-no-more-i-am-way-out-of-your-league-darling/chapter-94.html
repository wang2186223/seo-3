                <p>Katrina heard their words and responded with a mocking laugh, causing both Ronald and Wyatt to shift uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; they demanded angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina crossed her arms, her attitude suddenly shifting from the meek persona she had put on for Caiden.With a biting smirk, she shot a cold look at Ronald and Wyatt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two? Really? Like you&#39;re even close to deserving that. A million-dollar salary? Please, do you actually think that&#39;s ever going to happen? I get it, you&#39;re broke. Fine. But I&#39;ve got more important things to focus on right now. Want money? Here, take this handout and stop whining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s expression soured, his eyes narrowing.&#34;Katrina! Who do you think you&#39;re insulting? A handout from you? Don&#39;t make me laugh. You&#39;re nothing but a gold digger who wormed her way into my brother&#39;s bed. What do you have to be so smug about? Let me make it clear-if you don&#39;t make things right and compensate us for our losses today, I won&#39;t  just let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was one thing Katrina couldn&#39;t stand, it was when people brought up her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked her way up by playing the sympathy card, starting as a maid under Brylee before setting her sights on Caiden. The affair had been a scandal at the time,whispered about behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after she gained power, she made sure to replace all the household staff, making sure no one would ever bring it up again-until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two idiots had crossed the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leslie! Get them out of here!&#34; Katrina&#39;s anger flared,her voice rising. &#34;Forget the money! I wouldn&#39;t even give them a single hair from my head!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, you&#39;ve got some nerve!&#34; A sudden, stinging slap landed across her cheek, making Katrina gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot up to her face as she turned around,only to find Peyton standing right in front of her.&#34;Peyton? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton squinted, her gaze sharp and unforgiving. She hadn&#39;t uttered a single word up until this point and quietly watched everything unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, this daughter-in-law had become  increasingly bold and disrespectful. Peyton hadn&#39;t taken Ronald&#39;s and Wyatt&#39;s complaints seriously when they first called. Katrina&#39;s sweet words and docile nature had been nothing more than a carefully crafted act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Caiden down here!&#34; Peyton commanded sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pressed her lips together, her left cheek now swollen from the slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,she cursed whoever had thought it was a good idea to bring Peyton back from the countryside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, she said, &#34;Didn&#39;t you mention you weren&#39;t used to city life? What brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she cursed Peyton in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton remained seated, her posture rigid and unyielding. &#34;Bring Caiden down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden walked in, he offered a quiet &#34;Mom&#34; in greeting before settling into a seat close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was sent upstairs, out of earshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s voice dropped to a chilling tone as she turned to him. &#34;So, you&#39;ve cut ties with Daniela, have you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,perched on a small stool, gave a brief nod. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your own daughter. Your flesh and blood. Have you completely lost your sense, Caiden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he&#39;d been hearing this so much that it hardly registered anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden glanced up at the stairs and saw Katrina watching from above. He was about to say something but thought better of it and kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regardless of anything,Daniela is your firstborn.How could you be so cruel? She&#39;s always had a gentle heart. If you hadn&#39;t pushed her to her limits, she wouldn&#39;t have pulled away. Even now, she&#39;s still considering ways to help her uncles find employment.Her heart is in the right place, Caiden. I&#39;m telling you,it&#39;s time to bring Daniela back into this family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden paused, glancing at the stairs again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Katrina hurried down the stairs. &#34;That&#39;s out of the question! Caiden&#39;s decision to cut ties with Daniela was officially approved!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was in a panic. Alexander was ready to marry Joyce. Once Joyce took over the Harper family&#39;s fortune,Katrina wouldn&#39;t need Caiden anymore. With the Bennett family&#39;s support, there was nothing Joyce couldn&#39;t do. She&#39;d already imagined a future where Alexander ruled Harper Group,with Joyce-her daughter-giving her the power she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was done being subservient. She was eagerly anticipating the day when Caiden would be the one waiting on her, not the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,Peyton wanted to bring Daniela back into the picture? That could mess everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s gaze sharpened as she glared at Katrina.&#34;I don&#39;t care about legal papers. Daniela is still part of this family, whether you like it or not. Without my approval and a proper family meeting,she stays. The wealth you have now is because of Brylee. I kept quiet when you remarried, but I won&#39;t sit back and let outsiders take advantage of my granddaughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Peyton, the only thing that truly mattered was bloodline. How could Joyce possibly inherit the Harper family legacy? Absolutely not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hung his head, not daring to protest. &#34;Mom,please don&#39;t get upset. You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll do whatever you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s anger eased just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Katrina suddenly lifted her head in pure shock. &#34;Caiden! What exactly do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald quickly stepped in. &#34;What&#39;s he talking about?Can&#39;t you see? Mom&#39;s here, and in this family, her word is law. Are you really going to defy her? Or are you trying to take down the whole Harper family just to help your daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a grave accusation, and Katrina knew she couldn&#39;t risk making things worse before securing the assets she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton shot Katrina a smug smile before focusing back on Caiden. &#34;I&#39;m not leaving. I&#39;ll stay here until this is sorted and Daniela is back where she belongs.Only then will I go back to the countryside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt and Ronald were quick to assist Peyton, eager to settle her into the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, Daniela&#39;s return wasn&#39;t just about family-it also meant that their promised salaries would finally be within reach again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, Katrina had been holding on tightly to control,leaving them with nothing as a result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On that very day, Peyton, Ronald, Wyatt, and their families-at least twenty people in total-moved into the house.</p>
