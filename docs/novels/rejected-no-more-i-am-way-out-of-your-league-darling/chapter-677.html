                <p>The moment Alexander stepped through the door, he wasted no time sharing the news with Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s eldest son? You&#39;re kidding,right? Are you absolutely sure we&#39;re talking about Hamilton McCoy -the richest man on the planet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a firm nod, and Richard&#39;s eyes lit up with uncontained excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The world&#39;s richest man? If we could snag even a fraction of their mining empire, Bennett Group would skyrocket! But why Olisvine? Oiscoll has everything they need. Do they really have to expand here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brows knit together. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. But Nikolas handed me access cards for both Elite Lux and Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard leaned in, voice quick and eager.&#34;You need to keep Daniela close-and Nikolas even closer. He&#39;s the future heir of the McCoy dynasty. With him and Daniela on our side, Bennett Group will never have to worry about money again. Invite him to dinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded, a knowing smirk forming. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I had in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas agreed to join them for dinner without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard went all out, filling the dinner table with an array of dishes tailored to Nikolas&#39; taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they settled in, Nikolas asked, &#34;You said Daniela was your wife. What happened between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a long, weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard leaned forward, voice heavy with bitterness.&#34;It&#39;s all because of Cedric&#39;s scheming ways. Daniela struggled with depression when she was younger,and it was Alexander who helped her through it. But then Cedric swooped in, twisting the story, claiming he was the one who pulled her out of the darkness. He&#39;s got a silver tongue, and over time, Daniela believed him.She drifted away from Alexander. Alexander didn&#39;t always look like this. Cedric beat him to a pulp, all because Daniela preferred his face over Cedric&#39;s.Cedric holds a lot of power in Olisvine. People see the injustice, but no one dares to stand against him. He&#39;s too ruthless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a low chuckle, skepticism flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t gullible enough to take their words at face value. &#34;So...&#34; Nikolas drawled, eyes sharp with interest.&#34;What&#39;s your next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sighed, shaking his head. &#34;Our hands are tied.That&#39;s why we need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked, amusement dancing in his eyes.′′Ancl how exactly am I supposed to do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard offered a knowing smile. &#34;If you could just create an opportunity for Daniela and Alexander to spend a night together, it would drive a wedge between her and Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas arched a brow. &#34;That&#39;s it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it. You&#39;re an esteemed guest of both Phillips Group and Elite Lux. You can just give Daniela a glass of drugged wine. Pretty simple, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ll give you an address-just take her there. I guarantee, once it&#39;s done,Daniela and Cedric will be over. And if you&#39;re interested in any future collaborations,Bennett Group will ensure y/our interests always come first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had no interest in Bennett Group&#39;s wealth or resources. The only thing on his mind was pulling Daniela away from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas stepped inside,Daniela was sprawled on the couch, eyes fixed on the TV. She didn&#39;t even spare him a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas studied her features, the flickering light of the TV tracing soft shadows across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something unfamiliar twisted in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, were you really depressed when you were younger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it Alexander who helped you through it? And Cedric just took all the credit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danielastayed slouched against the sofa, eyes glued to the screen. &#34;You ran into Alexander, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked in surprise. Did she have some kind of sixth sense? How did she put it together from just that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They said I had depression? And that Cedric took the credit for helping me? Please. The Bennett family Loves twisting stories. The one who actually helped me was Cedric, right?&#34; Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and the others had touched on her three years of amnesia before, but they never really dived into the part about depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas met her icy stare before shutting his own eyes. &#34;How the hell would I know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric strolled out of the kitchen. Daniela called out, &#34;When I was little and depressed, were you the one who used to paint for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a slow nod.&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t miss it-after Cedric spoke, Daniela&#39;s eyes lingered on him a beat too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scoffed internally. Damn! The Bennett family couldn&#39;t even bother to make their lies believable? At least put some effort into it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s breath hitched. &#34;You were the boy from back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time,Alexander tried to steal the credit. But this time, thanks to Nikolas, Cedric could finally claim it without hesitation. &#34;Yeah. That was me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze for a moment, her mind struggling to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan and the others never mentioned it to you?&#34;Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric settled beside her, offering a strawberry. &#34;I told you before, but you forgot. Doesn&#39;t matter.What&#39;s important is that you know now.&#34; Daniela gazed at Cedric, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled. &#34;You always react the same way.Last time you learned this, you looked just as stunned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted a hand and ruffled Daniela&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she didn&#39;t pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl I cared for has blossomed into a mature woman,&#34; Cedric murmured, as if fulfilling an old vow.&#34;I swore to your mother that I&#39;d always be there for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas observed the moment play out, realizing the game was lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was supposed to separate them, yet somehow,he&#39;d ended up bringing these two closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
