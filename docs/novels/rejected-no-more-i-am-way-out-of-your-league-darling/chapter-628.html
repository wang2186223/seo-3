                <p>Richard, who had maintained his composure until now,let a trace of unease slip into his voice. &#34;Alexander,what&#39;s happening? Has Daniela still not made peace with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration was etched across Alexander&#39;s face. &#34;I have no idea what went wrong. Why is Daniela keeping her distance from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard ventured, &#34;Is this about Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told her already-I don&#39;t have any feelings for Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard shook his head. &#34;I don&#39;t buy it. This has to be about Joyce. Daniela used to adore you, and now that her memory&#39;s gone-barely remembering Cedric-there&#39;s no logical reason for her to push you away.Someone must have spoilled the beans about your history with Joyce, and that&#39;s why she&#39;s keeping you at arm&#39;s length. Alexander, I&#39;m not here to pressure you, but this is a golden opportunity. You can&#39;t let it slip through your fingers. If Cedric gets ahead of you again, you&#39;ll lose face-and everything you&#39;ve worked for will be for nothing. And let&#39;s not forget, Cedric&#39;s already at a disadvantage with his injury. Are you really going to let him outpace you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s response was instant. &#34;No way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded in approval. &#34;Then here&#39;s the plan.Tell Daniela that I invite her over for dinner.We&#39;ve had our share of misunderstandings, and it&#39;s time l made an effort to smooth things over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated. &#34;I&#39;ll give it a shot. She&#39;s been pretty busy lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Busy or not, everyone has to eat,&#34; Richard said, fixing Alexander with a sharp look. &#34;Do you even realize how many people have their eyes on Daniela? I heard the Stout family is already making moves-they&#39;ve sent an intermediary to set up a meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stiffened. &#34;Already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard scoffed. &#34;What did you think would happen?Those people don&#39;t play fair. Daniela&#39;s marital status means nothing to them-profits are all they care about. You get that,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless, Alexander shot up from his chair. &#34;I&#39;ll go invite her right now. Dad, make sure to prepare her favorite dishes. And when she gets here, please don&#39;t put on airs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard waved a hand, brushing off the concern.&#34;Naturally. Just get her here-I&#39;ll treat her like royalty.&#34; Alexander gave a firm nod before making a beeline for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was heading upstairs,with his secretary carrying a box of sushi, when he spotted Alexander storming through the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could even process what was happening,Alexander swooped in, grabbed the sushi straight from his secretary&#39;s hands, and bolted upstairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen, utterly baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows knitted together. Fresh from rehabilitation, he had taken the time to prepare that sushi himself-for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated Alexander being this brazen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric rushed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached the top, he caught Carol&#39;s voice.&#34;Sorry,but Daniela isn&#39;t here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander extended the sushi box. &#34;Please pass this to her and let her know my father and I are inviting her to dinner. I also need to discuss something with Daniela.Would it be alright if I waited here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,unfazed,gestured towards the conference room.Alexander offered a small smile and strode over, only to halt in surprise. The room was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown of confusion crossed Alexander&#39;s face as he glanced at Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol smirked. &#34;They&#39;re all here for the same reason as you-hoping to invite Daniela to dinner. Feel free to join the club.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, too, was considering staying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he moved forward, Carol cut in. &#34;Cedric,don&#39;t you have your own place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stilled. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol remained unfazed. &#34;Exactly what I said. Need me to spell it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched as Cedric stepped forward.Without hesitation, Carol returned the sushi box to Cedric. &#34;Daniela isn&#39;t here. No clue when she&#39;ll be back-or if she&#39;ll be back at all. You&#39;re welcome to wait,but if it takes too long, you can leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was taken aback by Carol&#39;s change in attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shrugged. &#34;I don&#39;t know you that well, but I&#39;ve noticed Nina holds you in high regard-like family. And,well,Ryan and Lillian called me yesterday-told me to ease up on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered a polite smile. &#34;Appreciate it.&#34; Daniela had been gone for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she returned, the conference room stood silent and deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only light in the office came from a dim desk lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced up. &#34;Cedric dropped by with sushi-said he made it himself. And he waited for...&#34; She checked the time. &#34;Eight hours. And Alexander was the second last to leave. Said he&#39;d be back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely reacted. Stepping into the office, her gaze landed on Cedric, still seated on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sushi box rested untouched on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat upright, legs together, a picture of quiet patience as he waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No phone in hand, no magazine, no distractions-nothing but stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the soft glow of the lamp, he simply waited -for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a distant, almost forgotten image flickered through Daniela&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she had seen this before-as if this wasn&#39;t the first time Cedric had waited for her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though he had been waiting for her-not just tonight, but for years, steadfast and unwavering.</p>
