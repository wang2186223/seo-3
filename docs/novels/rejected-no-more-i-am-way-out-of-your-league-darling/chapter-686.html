                <p>Nikolas froze, momentarily caught off guard by what had just slipped out of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blurted out, &#34;Think it&#39;s too late to break my leg now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow, momentarily startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas continued, &#34;What if I make it two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, Nikolas had a feeling that if he could win Daniela&#39;s favor, he could win the leadership of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what, he was going to get on Daniela&#39;s good side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could open her mouth, a cold chuckle sliced through the air from the doorway. &#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas spun around to find Cedric standing at the doorway, his expression carved from ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said nothing at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a dry chuckle, stepping toward Nikolas.&#34;Really? I could&#39;ve sworn I heard you volunteer to break your leg. No need to trouble my wife-allow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric grabbed Nikolas and hauled him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; wails trailed down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Cedric wouldn&#39;t get hurt, Daniela saw no reason to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She summoned Carol. &#34;Find out how Ghost got taken down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiding Cedric meant protecting her own interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever had helped Cedric had earned a debt from her. It was only fair she uncovered their identity. Daniela never left a debt unpaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol responded, &#34;We&#39;ve looked into it. It was Zahir,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lone Wolf&#39;s boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned. &#34;Lone Wolf? Didn&#39;t they declare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>long ago that they were leaving the underworld</p>
                
                
                
                <p>behind for business? Why are they suddenly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>resurfacing?&#34;Carol scratched her head. &#34;Beats me. And now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>there&#39;s this boss? | didn&#39;t even know Lone Wolf</p>
                
                
                
                <p>answered to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ordered, &#34;Dig up everything you can on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zahir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;We&#39;re looking into it. Must be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone powerful. But why would they go out of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>their way to help Cedric with something this serious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This isn&#39;t something that can be explained by mere</p>
                
                
                
                <p>business ties. Ghost is a notorious underworld figure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-the second-ranked assassin, right after you-yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he was taken down just like that. Everyone&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>speculating about the true identity of this Zahir.  Could it be another woman who harbors feelings for Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol explained, &#34;Think about it. You&#39;re Cedric&#39;s wife,so naturally, you&#39;d protect him, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela considered for a beat before nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol continued, &#34;Other than a wife, there&#39;s family.But Cedric&#39;s an orphan, and his grandmother can&#39;t even walk. So that leaves what? Only someone who truly loves you would risk their life for you.Remember when Alexander left? He said you&#39;d know who cared most because they&#39;d be willing to lay it all on the line for you. Love means removing danger from someone&#39;s path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Alexander, Daniela&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol hurriedly added, &#34;I know it&#39;s blunt, but the logic holds. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric returned, he immediately noticed the way Daniela was looking at him-different, almost questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something wrong?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a wild thought struck Daniela.&#34;Cedric,do you know Ghost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden draft swept in, and Cedric nearly choked.&#34;What?Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instantly regretted asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric could never be Zahir. What secret could he possibly be hiding from her? With his polished,sophisticated demeanor, how could he be the leader of Lone Wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it,&#34; Daniela muttered, shifting her focus back to her files. &#34;I want strawberries. Go wash some for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Nikolas let out a cold chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, even you misjudge things sometimes? If Cedric turns out to be Zahir, I&#39;ll eat my damn hat!&#34;</p>
