                <p>Alexander left Harper Group early in the morning,feeling frustrated after his visit didn&#39;t go as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By afternoon, Elite Lux had kicked off the bidding for construction project in the South and East Districts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith showed up soon after, looking around the room for Alexander. When he spotted him in the front row,he quickly made his way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help!&#34; Keith said urgently, sitting next to Alexander with a bidding proposal full of dense text.Alexander, you&#39;re close to Daniela. Do you have any inside info on this bidding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished, the rest of the bidding team subtly shifted closer to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the eyes of everyone, despite Daniela now being the CEO of Elite Lux, she remained the figure who once trailed Alexander like a devoted follower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That image of Daniela as the ever-loyal follower was still deeply etched in their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t have any insider knowledge at all. But seeing how intently everyone was listening,he felt embarrassed to admit he had nothing to share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his lips tight and glanced at Keith. &#34;Why?Planning to go home and take over the family business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even talk about it. Last month, I crashed a Maserati, my band went bankrupt, and my gaming project lost more than thirty million. My dad said if l keep blowing money,he&#39;ll cut me off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, in Olisvine, wealthy families had been cutting ties with their children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People believed Daniela&#39;s success came from Caiden firmly pushing her to step up and face the world,which had led her to where she was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The month had barely started, and already two families had severed ties with their children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith was beyond frustrated. &#34;What is Daniela doing?Isn&#39;t it our job to be the spoiled,aimless rich kids? Now I&#39;m being forced into this bidding project, and if l don&#39;t win it, I&#39;m finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith gave Alexander a playful nudge. &#34;Come on, you have to help me out! Tell me, is there any inside scoop?&#34; Alexander lowered his gaze, his expression becoming thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith let out a deep sigh. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me the project has already been handed to you? With your connection to Daniela, it makes sense that she&#39;d give it to you. Alexander, be honest with me. If she&#39;s already given it to you, I won&#39;t waste my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander crossed his legs and sat back with a calm grace. &#34;Don&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words sent a chill through the room. They hinted that the project had already been decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though everyone had prepared themselves for this outcome, hearing Alexander&#39;s confirmation still caused a collective sigh. It was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was an opportunity so profitable that it could easily support multiple companies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith blinked in disbelief and whispered, &#34;Look, this is a goldmine. I&#39;m not asking for much, just a small share,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice from behind them chimed in eagerly, &#34;Hey,what about me? Mr. Bennett, I&#39;ll offer you a deal below market value,&#34; and gestured a number with excitement. Keith&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;Are you insane? If you offer below market value, there&#39;s no way you&#39;ll make a profit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? Profit? This deal&#39;s a complete loss,&#34;the person responded with a grin, as though it was all part of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith stared at the person&#39;s smiling face, clearly stunned. &#34;That smile doesn&#39;t look like someone who&#39;s losing money-it looks like you just made ten mnillion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you quite getit. Our families don&#39;t have competing products. Let me explain the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith nodded eagerly. &#34;Go ahead, I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander could feel the eyes of the room on him once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you know, Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux. She bought the landmark building without breaking a sweat. Her financial clout is truly impressive, wouldn&#39;t you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith gave a quick nod.&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander straightened in his seat, a touch of pride emanating from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s decision to take over the North District  construction reflects his sharp vision. When the bid came out, he didn&#39;t earn a dime. Do you know why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Keith asked, intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about cultivating a solid relationship with Daniela and Elite Lux. If the project hadn&#39;t been so time-sensitive, would there even have been a bidding process? Daniela could have simply handed it to Cedric, and we wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Landing the project contract is like securing a ticket to future partnerships with Elite Lux. It&#39;s about establishing a solid reputation with Daniela. Her influence is irrefutable, and Olisvine practically belongs to her. Construction projects won&#39;t be in short supply. In our field, it&#39;s well-known that it&#39;s smarter to work with trusted allies. Once you&#39;re on Daniela&#39;s radar, how could you ever fear financial struggles? Didn&#39;t your father teach you these fundamentals?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith was taken aback by what he had just heard.He turned to Alexander, his voice filled with awe.&#34;Alexander,is your ex-wife really this powerful now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander crossed his arms, his tone calm. &#34;It seems so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith couldn&#39;t hide the envy creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he known then, he would&#39;ve made a move on  Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying her would have meant becoming the master of Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at Keith for not acting sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man behind them handed Alexander a business card with respect, saying, &#34;Mr. Bennett, I&#39;ve heard a great deal about you. Let&#39;s get to know each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, business cards were passed to him one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t help but feel as if both Daniela and her projects were now in his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growing sense of satisfaction washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, another man handed Alexander a valuable antique, and Keith noticed the man subtly signal a number to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eight million dollars.</p>
