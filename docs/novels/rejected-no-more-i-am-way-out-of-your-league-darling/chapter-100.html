                <p>The Harper family&#39;s doorbell chimed unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was taken aback to find Daniela on the doorstep. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re back already?&#34; he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bustling noise from inside the house ceased instantly at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton appeared in the doorway, excitement etched on his face,with Ronald and Wyatt trailing behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve returned from abroad! How marvelous to see you, and look at you, more stunning than ever!&#34; Peyton burst out, his smile spreading from ear to ear. &#34;Please, come in-this is your home.Why stop at the doorstep? Come on in,I&#39;ve got fantastic news you need to hear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Peyton could elaborate further, Daniela cut in,her voice steady yet filled with urgency. &#34;I apologize for interrupting, but there&#39;s a sketchbook I left in my old room. It&#39;s quite personal to me, and I need to get it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frustration was palpable; she was annoyed with herself for overlooking such a vital item amidst the recent upheavals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daniela had assumed the figure from her past was Alexander. Having resolved to sever connections with him, she had dismissed the importance of the sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, upon realizing her mistake-that it wasn&#39;t him-she recognized the profound significance of the sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not she would ever reconnect with that individual, the sketchbook had been her refuge during bleak moments. It was an essential emotional lifeline,and she was determined not to forsake it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton attempted to usher Daniela through the doorway,yet Daniela briskly shrugged her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would it be too much trouble for you to retrieve it for me?&#34; Daniela asked Caiden, her voice carrying a frosty note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s response came quickly, accompanied by a fervent nod. &#34;Certainly. I&#39;ll go fetch it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,who had been observing from a short distance,squinted her eyes in suspicion, scrutinizing Caiden&#39;s apparent zeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his demeanor seemed decidedly peculiar. With a purposeful stride, Caiden ascended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Peyton, unfazed by the slight rejection,offered Daniela a reassuring smile. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t hesitate. Remember, you&#39;ll always belong with the Harper family. One day, all of this will be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent to the allure of the Harper family&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s three-month revenue was so staggering that they could have bought the Harper family outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disinterested in their trivial disputes, she stood at the doorway, waiting for Caiden to return with her sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton chuckled. &#34;You&#39;ve really taken after your mother-stubborn to the core. However, a young woman like yourself can&#39;t afford to be this way forever. There comes a time when you must learn to lean on others. Believe me, life gets a lot easier when you&#39;re not trying to juggle everything on your own.I recently met Alexander. He&#39;s quite tall, strikingly handsome,and moves with an air of confidence. Word is, their family business is flourishing. Should you choose to join their family, they might even lend their expertise in managing your company. Here&#39;s a bit of advice-there&#39;s no need for a woman to prove she&#39;s overly capable. At times, it&#39;s wiser to let others take the lead. Consider your mother-she toiled relentlessly, but to what end? After her passing, all her hard-earned gains simply lined the pockets of those who hardly deserved it. You should delegate more. Let the men in the family handle some things.Speaking of which,your uncles are not only skilled but they&#39;re family too. Cutting ties with Caiden doesn&#39;t change who you are-you&#39;re still family. So,about helping your uncles with their jobs-you&#39;ll do it,won&#39;t you? With your success, it&#39;s the perfect time to step up and help. Ronald&#39;s managed to buy a new home,though he&#39;s still struggling with the mortgage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s eyes sparkled with a mix of gratitude and urgency. &#34;Exactly, Mom! We&#39;re still stuck with over two million in debt to deal with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Wyatt. You haven&#39;t purchased a car yet, have you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt quickly responded, &#34;That&#39;s correct, Mom. But I&#39;ve set my sights on a limited-edition supercar-priced just a bit over ten million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald beamed with anticipation, exclaiming, &#34;Mom,I&#39;d like one too! My car&#39;s practically falling apart. And you know, our little house just isn&#39;t big enough for us anymore. Daniela, if you could get us another one,that&#39;d be absolutely incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton nodded with approval. &#34;Absolutely. With Daniela raking in the cash these days, it&#39;s only fair she lends a hand to her family. Daniela,you really should take care of your nieces&#39; and nephews&#39; school fees as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald chimed in, &#34;Mom, the kids have been dreaming of studying at an international school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton quickly concurred, &#34;Yes,definitely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald cast a cautious glance towards Daniela and whispered, &#34;But keep in mind, it&#39;s costly-millions per year. And if they go overseas for college, we&#39;re talking over ten million for each child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family had five children to consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fund of seventy to eighty million wouldn&#39;t be amiss -it took a fortune to provide the finest for one&#39;s children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s thoughts drifted towards the ambitious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton, steadfast in her resolve, proclaimed, &#34;Yes,that wilI do!&#34; She then turned to Ronald&#39;s wife, adding,&#34;You&#39;re fortunate to have Daniela&#39;s support. With such great opportunities, don&#39;t hold back. Expand the Harper family-Daniela can handle it!&#34;</p>
