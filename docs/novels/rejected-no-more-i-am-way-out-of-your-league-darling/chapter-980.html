            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>After stepping out of her company, Daniela paused,sensing someone was watching her. A sly, knowing smile flickered at the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noticed,his voice low. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Daniela squeezed his hand, the small gesture sharpening the chill in Cedric&#39;s gaze. His jaw tightened, an undercurrent of warning in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. Let&#39;s just go home,&#34; she said lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They slipped into the car-Cedric behind the wheel,Daniela settling in beside him. In the rearview mirror,she caught the unmistakable sight of three cars tailing them at a cautious distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally reached home,Daniela lifted a hand,bringing them to a stop. &#34;By the way, didn&#39;t New McCoy Group just pay out some nice dividends to you recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton faltered for a beat, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Honestly, there&#39;s no need to shadow me day and night. If you keep this up, people will start to think l&#39;ve actually hired you three as my  For This bodyguards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice took on a note of indignation. &#34;Don&#39;t lump me in with them. I&#39;m your children&#39;s grandfather.Of course I have to look out for you. You&#39;ve got a medical exam tomorrow-that&#39;s important.How could I not be there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad blinked innocently. &#34;Still haven&#39;t found a decent pláce, so I&#39;m staying here for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan grinned, stretching lazily. &#34;Yeah, nowhere else is half as cozy as your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela narrowed her eyes at the trio. &#34;Tomorrow,all of you start looking for your own places.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she strode inside, leaving the men to trade uneasy glances-Brad and Ethan both shooting Hamilton a silent, desperate plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Daniela slipped out for a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway down the block, that prickling sensation returned-someone watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Hamilton fell in step beside her,pressing a chilled bottle of water into her hand.Instantly, the uneasy feeling melted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping her gaze, Daniela murmured, &#34;I feel like having some fruit. Would you mind heading back and asking Cedric to rinse some blueberries for me?&#34; Hamilton hesitated, shifting his weight. &#34;It&#39;s not safe for you to be out here alone,Daniela. Let me call Brad and have him keep you company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted his jacket, frustration flickering across his face. &#34;Damn, I left my phone inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a measured sip from her bottle,unbothered. &#34;Why not just go call out for him? I&#39;ll stay right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked toward the house, then back at her,uncertain. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll just be two minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, he set off toward the villa, glancing over his shoulder every few steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Hamilton disappeared around the bend,Daniela turned onto a narrow side path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d barely taken a few steps before a tall shadow emerged up ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last streaks of sunlight barely reached the path,leaving the air thick with gloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a measured sip of water before tipping her chin up, her voice steady. &#34;You&#39;ve been tailing me for quite some time now. Is there something you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules narrowed his eyes, studying her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than flinching at the confrontation, Daniela appeared utterly unbothered. She let her gaze wander to a cluster of wildflowers growing by the path, her posture relaxed and almost amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knewN I was behind you?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why else would I choose this path?&#34; Daniela&#39;s lips curled in a faint,knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; brow arched in surprise. &#34;You&#39;re not the least bit scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scared of what, exactly?&#34; Daniela replied, meeting his eyes with a calm; unwavering look. &#34;Only people with guilty consciences need to worry. Don&#39;t you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Jules couldn&#39;t shake the storm brewing in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s company bled cash by the hour, and the weight of impending bankruptcy pressed on his soulders like a curse-soon, he&#39;d be the McCoy family&#39;s first public disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burdened by worries, he couldn&#39;t find a moment&#39;s sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, beneath the last golden light of sunset,something unexpected shifted in him. Daniela stood just ahead, her breezy floral dress stirring in the evening breeze, canvas shoes dusted with pollen as she bent to study the wildflowers by the road. The sight grounded him, easing his turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I know what you&#39;re after. I know who planned the explosion years ago. I have proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words hung in the air, Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a patient, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for this,&#34; she replied, straightening and meeting his eyes with quiet intensity. &#34;Waiting for someone with the courage to step forward. I suppose my patience has finally paid off.&#34;</p>
