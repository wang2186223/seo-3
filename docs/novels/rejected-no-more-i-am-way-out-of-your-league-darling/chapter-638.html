                <p>Days passed, yet Cedric never once set foot in Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was consumed with the weight of Josie&#39;s funeral arrangements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t make sense of it-why had Josie chosen to end her life so suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Elite Lux, Carol asked, &#34;Daniela, Josie took her own life. Should we take back the assets you gave her family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze drifted to the horizon. &#34;Her family should not bear the consequences of her actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol hesitated before asking, &#34;Should we tell Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was void of emotion. &#34;Unnecessary.&#34;She was someone without a past now, and Josie&#39;s death carried no weight to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Cedric, the pain would be unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone he had trusted like family had been the cause of his ruin. The guilt would eat at him, making him question if he could ever trust again. For over two decades, Josie had been more than a caretaker-she had been family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, he was just another casualty in this twisted game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol studied Daniela&#39;s sharp profile, realizing she had offered Cedric an unusual mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had endured the turmoil of losing billions,the agony of never bearing children, and te void of three lost years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she had brushed over Cedric&#39;s part in the explosion wth Josie&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had the question on the tip of her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela loved him so deeply, why not continue to stay together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious-Cedric still loved Daniela with every fiber of his being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the emptiness in Daniela&#39;s eyes made it clear-no one could reach her now. And so, Carol swallowed her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daníela, should we keep digging?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Uncover who&#39;s pulling the strings behind all of this!&#34; Carol gave a firm nod and walked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux was flourishing, its latest innovations in element fusion setting new benchmarks in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was drowning in envy and regret, his frustration teetering on the edge of madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, as Elite Lux stores sprang up in prime locations nationwide, he surrendered to the undeniable force of wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t stand in the way of you being with Daniela,but you better give me some grandchildren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;How&#39;s that supposed to happen? Daniela can&#39;t have kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,realization dawned on Alexander. &#34;You&#39;re saying having children with another woman? Daniela would never go for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does her opinion matter?&#34; Richard scoffed.&#34;She&#39;s the one who can&#39;t have kids, not you. The fact that you&#39;re still willing to marry her is a blessing for her and mark my words, once this news spreads, no man in high society will want her. That&#39;s when you swoop in, play the devoted lover, and she&#39;ll be eating out of your hand. She grew up without a mother-she&#39;s weak to kindness. Trust me. Leak the news that she&#39;s infertile, and she&#39;ll have no suitors left. Then,tell her you&#39;re willing to sacrifice fatherhood for her sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard clapped Alexander on the shoulder. &#34;She&#39;ll be in tears by then. And once you&#39;re married, your fortunes are intertwined. She wouldn&#39;t actually leave you over children born outside, would she? Daniela is sharp-she knows how to make the smartest choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander wavered. He had seen firsthand how ruthless Daniela could be. &#34;She&#39;s got a temper. If this turns into a scandal, she won&#39;t take it lying down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard smirked. &#34;Win her over first. Once you&#39;re married, just tell her you still want kids-it&#39;s her problem, not yours and if the truth ever leaks, no one will blame you. The pressure will be on Daniela-sooner or later, she&#39;ll give in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed quiet, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he considered it, the more his father&#39;s plan seemed reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step one, win her heart. Their fortune would need an heir eventually. If he had kids with someone else,he could pass them off as adopted-Daniela might even pity him for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just picturing Daniela&#39;s beauty sent a rush through him,making his pulse quicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Let&#39;s make it happen!&#34;</p>
