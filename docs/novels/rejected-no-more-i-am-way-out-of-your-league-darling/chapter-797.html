                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander snatched the phone from the assistant&#39;s hand. &#34;Daniela, hey It&#39;s me &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 30, 000 feet, Daniela sat buckled in, already halfway through her flight to Oiscoll. The moment she heard his voice, her eyes darted to the caller ID</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t his number. It belonged to her secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting two and two together, she figured he must have shown up at Elite Lux headquarters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped, thick with displeasure. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander approached the window, eyes tracking the helicopter. &#34;You flew to Oiscoll today, didn&#39;t you?need to get there too. Any chance you could come back and give me a lift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh was short and sharp. &#34;Alexander. You&#39;re serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, her helicopter was cruising steadily. Turning around wasn&#39;t even an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they were still grounded, she wouldn&#39;t have done it. They weren&#39;t on those kinds of terms-and hadn&#39;t been for a long time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not messing with you. It&#39;s my family Someone&#39;s dying. I need to get there before it&#39;s too late. I know I wasn&#39;t good to you before. I know I hurt you. But this is different. Please. Just this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother taking him off speaker</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the helicopter, Ryan, Lillian, and the pilot all exchanged looks as Alexander&#39;s voice echoed through the cabin, pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pilot, now aware of the commotion, subtly reduced their speed. He wasn&#39;t sure they&#39;d turn around,but he wasn&#39;t ruling it out yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the helicopter slow down ever so slightly,Alexander felt a flicker of hope spark inside him. Still,he kept his voice even, almost mournful. &#34;Daniela, I know we ended badly. But that&#39;s history now, isn&#39;t it?I really need help. You&#39;re already on your way. lt wouldn&#39;t be hard to swing back. I won&#39;t ask you for anything ever again after this. Just this one thing Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, the photographer stood frozen,clearly stunned by the exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on Daniela, the people around her wonderingif she might finally give in. &#34;Someone in your family&#39;s dying? In Oiscoll, of all places? How convenient&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed before Alexander answered simply,&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Daniela let out a short laugh.x&#34;So it just so happens that I&#39;m flying to Oiscoll today, and you track me down right as the photographer takes off? Now you want a favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension flared in his grip as Alexander squeezed the phone harder</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now,everyone nearby had picked up on her tone She wasn&#39;t buying a word of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the helicopter&#39;s engines roared louder as the pilot nudged it back to full speed Daniela&#39;s voice came back, cool and final. &#34;If fate&#39;s working so hard to line things up for you, l&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find another flight that fits your grand emergency. I&#39;m not turning around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words hit Alexander like a slap. Before he could form a reply, the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security at Elite Lux arrived moments later, ushering both Alexander and the photographer out without a fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the steps outside, the photographer let out an irritated groan. &#34;You&#39;ve got some serious nerve, man That whole act-impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still facing the Elite Lux building, Alexander stared up at the steel-and-glass monolith, something sharp gleaming in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not bothering to look back, he gave his next order calmly &#34;Daniela&#39;s stuck on that flight for the next twenty-four hours. Edit photos of me and Daniela and send them Hamilton. You&#39;ve got one hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer blinked. &#34;One hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;You&#39;ve got a team. Use them Make it flawless. Money&#39;s not an issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a check and handed it over without ceremony. The moment the photographer saw the number,his doubt vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, as he looked at the photos,Hamilton opened the email and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the attached images, he didn&#39;t wait-he called Alexander straight away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are these photos real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander replied, &#34;Absolutely.Ask anyone. Daniela was obsessed with me for years.We&#39;re getting close again. It was bound to happen eventually.&#34; Though Hamilton said nothing, he remembered the cold look on Daniela&#39;s face the last time he saw her,nothing like the affection captured in the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy,show them to Cedric if you want. They&#39;re authentic photos. He&#39;ll believe them,&#34; Alexander added</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Hamilton leaned back in his chair, still staring at the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, his secretary brought in an expert to examine the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, the results were in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Hamilton, we ran a full analysis. The photos are digitally altered,&#34; the assistant said. &#34;Still, the experts were impressed. They said anyone without a trained eye would be completely fooled. It&#39;s nearly good enough to pass as real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry sneer tugged at Hamilton&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much for Alexander&#39;s bravado-he couldn&#39;t even manage a couple of convincing photos after all that talk about Daniela being infatuated with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, his phone buzzed again with a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, Oiscoll&#39;s airspace is locked down. I can&#39;t get through. Can you send a private jet to pick me up?Trust me-once I arrive, Cedric and Daniela will be over for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing up, the secretary raised a brow&#34;Should we send a plane for him, Mr McCoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t bother hiding his irritation. &#34;No. Tell him to wait for air traffic to clear and find his own flight.&#34; His gaze flickered toward the photos spread across the table-fabricated intimacy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Hamilton walked into his home with his usual heavy silence. Without a word, he placed the folder of photos on the living room table before heading upstairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas stepped through the front door a few minutes later, the housekeeper greeted him warmly &#34;Your father&#39;s tied up with an online meeting tonight He said he won&#39;t be joining for dinner. Are you hungry?Should I make something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas replied, &#34;I didn&#39;t have lunch, so could you prepare..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention drifted mid-sentence, drawn to the photos lying open on the table-its contents visible under the soft lamp light</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the pause, the housekeeper leaned out from the kitchen. &#34;What would you like to eat?&#34;</p>
