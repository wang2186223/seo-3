                <p>Daniela barely noticed anything happening around her; she was glued to the soccer game on TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, while Daniela was getting ready for a nap, the rumble of a car outside signaled a visitor&#39;s arrival at the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered for a moment in the living room, only to see Brad&#39;s door swing open. He ran out in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief hesitation, Daniela quietly climbed the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the villa&#39;s sunlit yard, Hamilton stepped out of the car, barely getting his bearings before Brad hurried over to greet him. &#34;So? Did you talk to the Rowe family? What did they say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s excitement was unmistakable, his cheeks slightly flushed. &#34;Just like you predicted, the Rowe family is very interested in Nikolas. They want the two to meet first. If things go smoothly,the wedding could happen before the year ends. Everything the Rowe family owns will eventually go to Nikolas and Miss Rowe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of envy crept into Brad&#39;s voice. &#34;You can tell the Rowe family is being genuine about this. Not everyone gets such a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton agreed, &#34;Absolutely. I met Miss Rowe, too. She&#39;s quiet and doesn&#39;t put on airs. I think she&#39;ll be a great match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;Naturally, she is famous for her grace and good upbringing. If Nikolas fits in,it&#39;d be a perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton added, &#34;I need to freshen up and pay Nikolas a visit tonight. We shouldn&#39;t let this chance slip bý.It&#39;s too good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s grin grew wider. With Hamilton leaving the house, things were bound to get easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No kidding. Let&#39;s make sure we seal this deal soon,&#34; he urged. Still smiling,Hamilton walked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad,however, only sneered as he made his way in, spotting Carol deeply focused on her video game. He let out a mocking snort, making his disapproval obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol barely looked up from her game, her focus unbroken. &#34;Hey, did you hear anything strange just now?&#34;she asked the housekeeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still busy wiping down a table, the housekeeper shook her head and answered without much thought,&#34;Nope, didn&#39;t notice a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging off the curiosity, Carol went right back to playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night settled in. Brad settled himself on a barstool, his eyes drifting toward the television from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, with the clock ticking closer to ten, Daniela&#39;s gaze flickered to the wall. She turned to Carol.&#34;I left an important file at work. Can you grab it for me? It won&#39;t takelong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Sure, but it&#39;ll be over an hour round trip. If you&#39;re already asleep by then, should I just give it to Cedric instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That works for me,&#34; Daniela agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Carol made her way out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from his seat, Brad toyed with the idea of adding more poison to Daniela&#39;s fruit bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Daniela got up. Without even bothering to slip on shoes, she said to Cedric, &#34;I&#39;m going out for some air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Cedric would&#39;ve followed along, but tonight he just told her,&#34;Don&#39;t wander off too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed him a quick smile before stepping outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad cast a quick look at Cedric, who was busy in the kitchen, then watched Daniela slip outside before heading back to his own room. A short while later, he reappeared, strolling into the kitchen and asked Cedric,&#34;|want some orange juice.Maybe grab a couple of oranges from Daniela&#39;s fridge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper waved him off with a smile. &#34;No need for that. I picked up a fresh batch of oranges this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s perfect. Thanks,&#34; Brad replied, giving a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that,Brad pressed his lips together and wandered into the living room, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a seat and gazed out the window, spotting Daniela making her way back from her walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding not to linger on the sight, he turned his attention to the television instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the villa, Daniela stopped Nikolas before he could bring in a late-night meal for Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot Daniela a questioning look.′′|something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded toward the door, signaling that she wanted to speak in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Nikolas clutched the bag of food tighter and trailed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they reached the shade of a nearby tree, Daniela leaned back and gave him a steady look: &#34;You&#39;ve been showing up night after night with food. Carol may not say anything, but I have to ask-what are you really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t offer a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening up, Daniela continued, &#34;There&#39;s no need for you to keep comning around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to walk away, but Nikolas hurried to stop her. &#34;Wait... weren&#39;t we suppoosed to talk things through? Why end it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze held steady. &#34;You already know what your father wants. He&#39;s hoping you could marry Miss Rowe,not Carol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas could only tighten his lips, frustration evident in his silence. Daniela continued, her voice unwavering, &#34;We don&#39;t back down when things get tough. Don&#39;t drag me into something pointless. I&#39;m asking you-what exactly are you planning? I&#39;m not waiting days or weeks for an answer.I want it here and now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone left no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas realized she&#39;d been holding offon this conversation to avoid interfering in personal matters. But now that she had spoken,she would demand an answer.</p>
