                <p>Years of friendship hadn&#39;t prepared Carol for the steely edge in Cedric&#39;s voice as he called out,&#34;Daniela,get out here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden command left Carol reeling, unable to find her footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, equally blindsided, gaped at Cedric in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela started to rise from her seat, Alexander finally found his nerve and snapped, &#34;Who the hell do you think you are, barking at Daniela like that? Daniela...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely got the words &#34;don&#39;t go out&#34; out of his mouth before Daniela brushed past him without a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Alexander turned to Carol. &#34;What&#39;s Cedric&#39;s problem? Why did he yell at Daniela like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol kept her gaze fixed on the floor and replied with icy detachment, &#34;That&#39;s got nothingto do with you.Just say what you need to say and get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander dropped what he was holding. &#34;That&#39;s it-I&#39;m done talking. I have to see Daniela right now. What the hell is Cedric doing, shouting at her like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Alexander bolted from the room, anxiety prickling beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t shake the fear that Cedric, given his earlier outburst, might do something reckless to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Alexander shoved open the door to Daniela&#39;s office, he froze. Inside, Cedric had her caged against the wall, kissing her with a fierce urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s body pressed Daniela so tightly there was barely a sliver of air between them-every inch of her was pinned flush against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight hit Alexander like a punch to the chest, leaving him rooted in the doorway, utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were actually kissing-no mistake, no illusion-locked.together right in front of him. Cedric held his ground, refusing to let Daniela slip away. Eventually, her resistance faded, and she angled her face up to meet his lips, surrendering to the heat of his kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol sauntered over, a grin tugging at her mouth as she let out a sharp, teasing whistle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clapped Alexander on the shoulder. &#34;Alright, time to move along. Haven&#39;t you watched enough? Or do you want me to pull up a front-row seat for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her wrist, Carol swung the office door shut behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, staring at the unyielding door, his thoughts spinning with the image burned into his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d actually been kissing. Where did it go from here? Daniela&#39;s office had a lounge-he knew that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would they take things further in there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea twisted through Alexander&#39;s thoughts, leaving him rattled and unable to shake the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He staggered out of the building, so rattled he couldn&#39;t even recall where Arthur had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, Daniela was gasping for air by the time Cedric finally released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said you could use the tranquilizer?&#34; His tone was sharp, his eyes locked on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lashes fluttered as she caught her breath, the color rising in her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time you have to deal with garbage like that, leave it to someone else,&#34; he insisted, his voice low but commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a silent nod, and he gently helped her down from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ever pull a stunt like that again, you&#39;ll find the consequences far worse,&#34; he warned,his expression unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Daniela had known Cedric for years, she&#39;d rarely seen him lose his composure. He always seemed impossibly calm, as if nothing could ever push him over the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many times she threatened divorce or pressed those papers into his hand, Cedric never lost his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that seemed to shake him was seeing her hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the line he wouldn&#39;t let her cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met Daniela&#39;s eyes, his voice clear and steady. &#34;Whatever path you choose, whoever you decide to become, I&#39;ll stand by you. You once told me to be myself first, not just your husband. I want the same for you-l want you to be yourself, not just as my wife. Stay true to yourself. Butpromise me one thing. Don&#39;t ever risk your own safety. Not for anyone. Not for any reason. Don&#39;t tell me this wasn&#39;t deliberate. You know exactly what kind of person he is. You&#39;re using his blood as a test, pushing your own limits. But you&#39;re not invincible, Daniela. You&#39;re human. You have weaknesses, and that&#39;s not a flaw. Please stop pushing yourself to the edge. I disagree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the most easygoing man could turn intimidating when truly riled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela refused to flinch, but she didn&#39;t brush it off either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded her head.&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Cedric let out a breath and soften just a bit. &#34;You know I take every promise seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, he gently brushed a thumb over Daniela&#39;s reddened lips. &#34;Where&#39;s Arthur? I&#39;ll handle things from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured wordlessly toward the rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric made his way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Mose strode in, a folder tucked under his arm, carrying fresh intel on the McCoy family&#39;s weaknesses.He trailed Cedric up to the rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door swung open, Mose froze, utterly stunned by what he saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, your wife is on another level!&#34; He shot Cedric a look of genuine awe, punctuating it with a hearty  thumbs-up. Was that really someone easily unsettled by the sight of blood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so much pouring out, she&#39;d barely flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he all right?&#34; Mose pressed, glancing at Arthur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered without missing a beat, &#34;She knows exactly what she&#39;s doing.&#34; He gave the paramedics a quick nod, signaling them to take Arthur away. But Cedric&#39;s attention snagged on the cuts marring Arthur&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze narrowed, lingering a beat too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about those cuts tugged at his memory, leaving a cold weight in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still clutching the folder, Cedic searched his memory, piecing together the fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator chimed softly behind him-and in that instant, a vivid image blazed across Cedric&#39;s mind,leaving him rooted to the spot, breath caught in his throat.</p>
