                <p>Chapter should have closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela appeared to have no grounds for suspecting Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these thoughts, both Elyse and Natalie felt somewhat disturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Daniela&#39;s invitation to visit Caiden seemed like an ideal chance to clear their doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the office with a bright smile, Natalie bumped into Nina. &#34;Daniela is taking me and Mom to see Caiden today.Are you coming,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina answered coldly, &#34;What? Are you trying to show this off in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt a surge of satisfaction. She was convinced that Daniela had no suspicions, or else why would she allow them to see Caiden? People often grew overconfident when they felt secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re staying with the Harper family, right? So, Daniela is going to see Caiden today and didn&#39;t invite you?It looks like you&#39;re not that close after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remembered the day Daniela had been exceptionally harsh with Caiden, and she still shivered at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Daniela&#39;s outward genteness, her inner fierceness was something few men could match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What repercussions might Natalie and Elyse encounter after their visit to Caiden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was quite eager to witness their reactions upon meeting Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m not that close with Daniela. Enjoy your visit to Caiden, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s smile stiffened momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been at odds with her since the failed wedding.Why was she suddenly being so accommodating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disturbed by this, Natalie spoke to Elyse about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Elyse responded, &#34;Natalie, you worry too much.How could Daniela possibly connect us to Brylee&#39;s death? Unless Katrina comes back to life, your fears are unfounded. Daniela is just a young woman.What secrets could she possibly uncover? If she had discovered anything, could she have remained so cordial with us all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s unease lingered, and she asked, &#34;But what if she has found out something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s look turned even more scornful. &#34;So what? Brylee has been dead for so long. What could Daniela do to us now? Caiden is involved as well. Now that he&#39;s sick, she still has to ensure he receives medical care.Would ®Daniela really alienate us over something that happened to Brylee? If she cuts ties, she&#39;ll end up isolated. Plus, does she have any proof linking us to Brylee&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shook her head, smiling confidently at Natalie. &#34;Dear, you give Daniela too much credit. She might be a competent CEO, but she&#39;s just a woman. She&#39;s not capable of causing us any serious trouble.&#34; These words somewhat calmed Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In any case, if it came down to Brylee&#39;s death,Caiden was mainly at fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was Daniela&#39;s father. Even if she was upset, would she really take extreme measures against him for someone who had passed away so long ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless she wanted the Harper family to break up completely.</p>
