                <p>Joyce was initially baffled by Daniela&#39;s words. She hesitated, her head bowed as she fished out her phone from her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon viewing the text, Joyce became statue-still. Then, looking at Daniela, she uttered, &#34;What are you getting at here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were seeking some leverage, weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Joyce&#39;s eyes as she leaned in, trying to hug Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela blocked her advance, keeping her at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cracked a small smile and shifted her focus to her phone. &#34;You&#39;re a shareholder of the robotics company.Should you need support, the company will stand behind you. You&#39;ll see dividends in due course;financial worries won&#39;t trouble you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s excitement was unmistakable, radiating from her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Katrina&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This windfall only fueled Joyce&#39;s combative spirit. The more Daniela contributed, the bigger the storm Joyce would brew for the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had just learned that Alexander had been intended to save Daniela from the fire, and now she seethed with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fresh resources and Daniela&#39;s pledged support, Joyce was primed to return and wreak havoc on the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina saw Joyce as a pawn in Daniela&#39;s game. As Joyce stood abruptly, pride lifting her stature, Katrina reached out and held her arm. &#34;Joyce, listen to me.Daniela has an agenda. You&#39;re too upset now. Maybe hold off on going back just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shook off Katrina&#39;s grasp, her face etched with frustration. &#34;Mom, I don&#39;t understand you anymore.Can&#39;t you see Alexander has driven me to the edge? Instead of backing me, you&#39;re preaching calm? You never held back when you went after Daniela. You always taught me that victory was all that counts.If I back down now, I&#39;Il be forever marginalized in the Bennett family. You&#39;ve always lived by your own rules, and now you expect me to just fold? That&#39;s hardly fair! You&#39;ve grown old and lost your zest, and frankly, Daniela shows me more kindness than you do. People are inherently selfish; that much is clear. You just want a comfortable life, just like when Alexander hurt me and you turned a blind eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Katrina&#39;s cheeks. &#34;Darling, how can you accuse me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, stop worrying about me. I know what I&#39;mn doing. You go ahead and cozy up to Daniela. She&#39;s a good person.&#34; With those words, Joyce departed without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina watched her daughter disappear, a pang of dread rising in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt on the brink of losing Joyce; perhaps she already had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fright gnawing at her, Katrina approached Daniela hastily. &#34;What are you plotting? What are your intentions with Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, then locked eyes with Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the harsh overhead lighting, Daniela&#39;s eyes shone with a sharp gleam, her lips curving into a subtle,icy smile. &#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was momentarily taken aback. Under Daniela&#39;s penetrating stare, her heart pounded wildly. She had an uneasy suspicion that Daniela knew more than she was letting on. But she wasn&#39;t sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? Are you trying to hurt Joyce? Daniela, we&#39;ve never been adversaries. Why manipulate her like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela brushed off the allegation, nonchalantly turning off her phone&#39;s screen. She then rose gracefully to her full height, looming over Katrina who clenched her fists. Daniela leaned in, her voice a whisper near Katrina&#39;s ear. &#34;Are you certain we&#39;ve never been adversaries? Or perhaps...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off, leaving the thought hanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina watched as Daniela straightened, her demeanor echoing that of Brylee&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill snaked through Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered slightly as Daniela finished her thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or perhaps this is a blood feud!&#34;</p>
