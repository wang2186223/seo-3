                <p>Cedric was frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he couldn&#39;t locate Daniela until his secretary indicated towards the meeting room. &#34;She&#39;s over here!&#34;Cedric hurried to the room and found Daniela comfortably nestled in the office armchair, bathed in sunlight while she napped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the noise of his approach disturbed her, Daniela&#39;s eyes fluttered open, and she greeted Cedric with a smile, &#34;Why the hurry? | was just taking a nap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a great sense of relief, Cedric embraced Daniela tightly. &#34;You had me worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded by patting Cedric&#39;s back lightly and laughed. &#34;Scared? Don&#39;t be. I&#39;m here, all safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout their walk to the office, Cedric gripped Daniela&#39;s hand firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing them, the secretary believed in love again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once back, Cedric only relaxed after he sat watching Daniela for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had felt unusually tired these past days, and upon reaching the office, she immediately took to the sofa for a sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stole glances at her repeatedly before he finally diverted his attention to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had received many voice messages from Rex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to use headphones this time, Cedric converted the audio messages into text to read them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,Cedric! You won&#39;t believe what happened! Down in the alley on Old Street, the leader of Extinction was gotten rid of. It took me by surprise. Guess who I saw? Clarinda! She was decked out in all black: a loose hoodie, a baseball cap, skinny jeans, and a mask. When she first showed up, she seemed like any other young woman with her hair in a high ponytail. She moved in silence, and before | fully realized what was happening, it was all over. The encounter was just a blur of swift actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised an eyebrow at the message.&#34;The Old Street?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right! The Old Street, just opposite Phillips Group. Quite the coincidence, huh? I meant to message you, but everything happened so quickly. They neutralized the leader of Extinction before | could even reach for my phone. Following this incident, it&#39;s obvious to everyone that Clarinda has got your back.Who would dare to touch you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused for a moment before he asked,&#34;Can you get in touch with Shadow? I&#39;d like to see her personally tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex responded, &#34;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was confused.Had they become that close?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Rex messaged again. &#34;Shadow&#39;s on her way up to see you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s confusion deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Rex added, &#34;I&#39;m coming up as well. I want to say hello to your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, the door to Cedric&#39;s office opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall woman clad in black entered Cedric&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Daniela, who was still sleeping, and signaled for Shadow to speak on the other side of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It might have been his imagination, but Cedric thòught Shadow&#39;s eyes lingered on Daniela a moment longer as she walked past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, and Shadow stepped closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you looking out for me?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow folded her arms, her voice calm and detached. &#34;Our boss just told me to stretch my legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was skeptical of her response but chose not to challenge her. &#34;I&#39;m willing to pay for protecti on at the going rate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow gave a nod and said, &#34;Alright, but I&#39;m not the one to set the price. You&#39;ll need to discuss that with our boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t beat around the bush. &#34;When can I meet your boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more,Cedric noticed Shadow&#39;s gaze drifting towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric positioned himself to obstruct Shadow&#39;s view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight smirk, Shadow said, &#34;Relax. I was merely appreciating your wife&#39;s beauty. Nothing more. Our boss will meet with you whenever she decides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Shadow gestured with her hand and exited the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked past Daniela, she crisply announced, &#34;I&#39;m heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Rex observed as Shadow stepped into the stairwell and quickly blended into the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex turned from the now empty stairwell to where Daniela lay asleep on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quietly said to Cedric, &#34;Cedric, why is your wife still sleeping at this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came and went, and she remained undisturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex wondered if his boss had married a lazy woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was undeniably attractive, though her apparent lethargy was less appealig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Cedric responded, gazing at Daniela with fondness. &#34;She just went for a quick walk downstairs and it wore her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex offered a strained smile. Tired of just a brief walk? On the other hand, Clarinda had just been involved in a significant altercation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Cedric. I need to get going.&#34; Before leaving, Rex took another look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite himself, he felt a strange resemblance between Daniela&#39;s figure and Clarinda&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be his imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela had become fatigued merely from a brief walk downstairs.</p>
