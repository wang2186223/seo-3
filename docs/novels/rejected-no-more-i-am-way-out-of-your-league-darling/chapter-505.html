                <p>Natalie and Elyse lit up at the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spun around eagerly, only for their excitement to fade the moment they saw Linden standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; Natalie scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could a mere family doctor possibly bring to the table?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much money could he even have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain she could earn more on her own than she ever would by marrying him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying a poor man and living a life of struggle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a chance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was never going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If wealth hadn&#39;t been her priority, she wouldn&#39;t have settled for someone as hideous as Doug in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, she and Elyse turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s voice rang out behind them. &#34;I may not have much money, but Daniela does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stopped in her tracks and let out a sharp laugh. &#34;You actually think Daniela would listen to you? Do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you think you&#39;re Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden met her gaze calmly. &#34;She promised me that if I got married, she would give me a gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie eyed Linden with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already asked her for that hillside villa you used to own.If you marry me, it&#39;ll be yours.&#34; She didn&#39;t believe him for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden pulled out his phone and showed them a photo of the property deed. &#34;If you&#39;re doubtful, you can wait until I officially get the villa before deciding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was equally quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the greed in their eyes, Linden pressed on. &#34;That villa, if sold properly, could easily go for billions.Natalie, isn&#39;t marrying rich exactly what you wanted? Marry me, and you won&#39;t just have money on paper-you&#39;ll have real, tangible wealth. Be honest. In Olisvine, besides Daniela and Cedric, who else can offer you that kind of fortune? If you marry me, you marry a rich man, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His argument was airtight. All those years of education hadn&#39;t gone to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shot a glance at Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse hesitated. &#34;But at the end of the day, it&#39;s still under your name. It&#39;s yours. Who knows who you&#39;ll hand it over to? And if you divorce Natalie, won&#39;t we end up with nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s lips curled into a smile. &#34;I can sign an agreement. If I&#39;m the one to file for divorce, the villa will go to Natalie, no conditions attached.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse leaned in slightly. &#34;And what if Natalie,can&#39;t stand it anymore and wants to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s smile didn&#39;t waver. It was relaxed, even generous. &#34;As long as she stays married to me for five years,then whether she wants to stay or go, the villa will belong to her. Everything I just said can be written in the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip, clearly tempted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just five years! After that, she could leave Linden and keep the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like making billions in five years!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even marrying Doug wouldn&#39;t guarantee that kind of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wavered, on the verge of agreeing, but Elyse held her back.&#34;We need to think this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned to her, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you marry him and he refuses to divorce you, then what? Are you willing to waste your entire life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides,once married, any, disputes would become family matters-outsiders wouldn&#39;t be able to interfere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden seemed sharp. Natalie might not be able to outmaneuver him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And self-made men were always more guarded about their money than people like Doug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In any case, we need time to consider.&#34; Elyse&#39;s tone was firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll give you three days. If I don&#39;t hear back, then let&#39;s drop this entirely-I&#39;ll just propose to Nina instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse pressed her lips together and pulled Natalie away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden watched Natalie disappear down the hall. His mind flashed back to the day Doug had backed her into the elevator. She hadn&#39;t looked frightened. She had looked pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists curled tight.</p>
