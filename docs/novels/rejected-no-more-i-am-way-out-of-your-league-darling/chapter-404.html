                <p>Nina knew she couldn&#39;t die. She still had the task of saving Cedric. She had to rescue the man she loved from danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw Daniela at the hospital, Nina suddenly felt a strange sense of superiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed to her that Daniela might not possess the same bravery she did. She was willing to sacrifice everything for love, not just talk about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gazed at Nina with a puzzled look and asked Daniela, &#34;Has she lost her mind today? Where is she getting this arrogance from? Just look at her, acting as if she&#39;s Cedric&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained seated, her eyes fixed on Nina. She,too, noticed Nina&#39;s odd demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, Nina was docile, particularly with a domineering sister like Natalie outshining her. Nina&#39;s existence was not exactly smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she was an heiress of the Dury family, she hadn&#39;t experienced the same privileges as Natalie. Her thoughts often leaned towards naivety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whenever things seem off, there&#39;s usually a reason.  Have someone keep an eye on Nina,&#34; Daniela instructed, her expression turning serious as she remembered seeing Elyse and Natalie whispering at the end of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her phone to review the surveillance video from the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to find out what Elyse and Natalie were discussing, a shadow emerged over her computer screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up to find Nina standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a hint of fear flickered in her eyes, she carried herself with a newfound confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,how is Cedric doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coldly, &#34;Didn&#39;t you see it yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina pursed her lips before saying, &#34;I understand that I fall short in every way compared to you, but there&#39;s one thing where you can&#39;t compete. What I&#39;m willing to do for Cedric is something you could never accomplish in a lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched Nina silently. Her eyes were calm and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina admired her composed manner, wishing she could mirror it, but deep down, she knew she couldn&#39;t.Standing in the shadows of Daniela and Natalie, she  often felt like a nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,she was prepared to sacrifice everything for Cedric!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this matter,she was unmatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina faced Daniela and said, &#34;I know you dislike me,and the feeling is mutual, but for Cedric&#39;s sake, I will make an effort to get along with you in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela navigated the surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Lillian exclaimed, &#34;Oh my! Is Nina really Elyse&#39;s daughter? Has she lost her senses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk! What a spectacle!&#34; Lillian looked to Daniela, who appeared determined. &#34;What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes landed on Linden, who was nearby. A cold,sharp intent flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden checked a message from Elyse on his phone,his lips curling into a sinister smile as he typed, &#34;See you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up and locked eyes with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle smile, he approached. &#34;Ms. Harper, do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back in her chair, her tone cold. &#34;Any updates on the investigation? What kind of food has kept Cedric in a coma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was surprisedby the turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, Daniela had always communicated with the attending doctor for any matter. He felt somewhat flattered. Could Daniela be attracted to his charm? It appeared that no women were immune to his charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, he intended to prove his skill in bed to Natalie, and on another day..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes greedily scanned Daniela&#39;s flawless face.&#34;Ms. Harper, rest assured, we are carefully working to identify the cause. I am certain that we will come to a satisfying resolution very soon. Ms. Harper, I hope you won&#39;t mind a bold request. May I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden chuckled and said, &#34;I&#39;ve had the privilege of witnessing your authority up close and have always held you in high regard. I wonder if I could be considered to become your personal doctor in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of a family doctor crossing professional lines with a female CEO was undeniably tempting. Lillian nearly vomited on the spot. She was prepared to beat the shameless man, but Daniela held her back with a simple gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of delight appeared on Linden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said coolly, &#34;Opportunities may arise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Linden left, clearly pleased, Daniela turned to the attending doctor and said, &#34;Check the pastries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor gathered his trusted team to conduct a secret investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nina sat at her dresser, as Elyse carefully brushed her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emotional walls Nina had built recently came crashing down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her visit to the hospital, she caught sight of Linden through the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His demeanor was unpleasant. He had shifty eyes and a short, balding stature. He was precisely the type of person she found utterly unpleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bravery she had gathered in front of Daniela completely disappeared. She felt humbled and gloomy,overwhelmed with sadness and hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not bring herself to accept Linden, nor  could she bear the thought of Cedric possibly finding her disgusting after learning she had been with someone so unpleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse comforted her, &#34;Nina, remember, nothing in this world is free. Every gain comes with its price. I know this is a steep price, but it will be worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice shook as she cried, &#34;Mom, promise me Cedric will love me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s gaze was firm. &#34;I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening set in, Nina dressed in seductive lingerie and was escorted to a romantic hotel suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lighting inside was soft and dim, with rose petals scattered across the bed, creating the perfect atmosphere for what was about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Nina&#39;s cheeks as Elyse wrapped a veil over her face. &#34;I understand you are upset.Keep this on; don&#39;t remove it. Just close your eyes, and soon it will be over. When you open them, Cedric will be saved. Nina, you will get everything you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through her tears, Nina nodded. She was determined to achieve her desires.Definitely!</p>
