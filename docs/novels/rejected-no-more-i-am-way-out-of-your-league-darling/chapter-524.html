                <p>Richard stepped into the gathering, his gaze sweeping over the once-mighty business tycoons, now sitting in silence, their faces etched with an uncharacteristic heaviness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into a chair, he crossed one leg over the other, his posture dripping with quiet arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same men who once swaggered around, barking orders like kings, were now forced to swallow their pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His future daughter-in-law had struck with razor-sharp precision.What a remarkable woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, you&#39;ve made it!&#34; Hackett greeted him with a warm smile, lowering himself into a chair by the coffee table. &#34;You&#39;re looking better than ever these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard let out a light chuckle. &#34;Naturally. Nothing lifts the spirits like watching a grand spectacle unfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning behind his words wasn&#39;t lost on the others. Their expressions turned grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, however, kept his smile intact. &#34;Indeed, it was quite the display. Daniela has an uncanny decisiveness, and her strategies are nothing short of brilliant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Hackett commend Daniela sent a wave of satisfaction through Richard, his chest swelling with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Hackett&#39;s gaze drifted across the room, his smile slowly dimming.&#34;Isn&#39;t she being a little too high-profile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s voice remained calm. &#34;If she&#39;s got the talent, why should she have to keep a low profile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough, but she&#39;s been making moves a bit too boldly. At the end of the day, she&#39;s still just one woman.No matter how skilled she is, she should be wary of steering straight into a storm, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Someone else let out a chuckle. &#34;No matter how sharp she is, she&#39;s still just one person. Richard, I hear there&#39;s talk of Daniela possibly making amends with your son? If that&#39;s true, let me give you a word of caution. Building a company is tough, but protecting it is even tougher. Don&#39;t let her boldness put your family&#39;s future at risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet chuckle came from someone nearby. &#34;We seasoned players have been keeping our distance out of respect. But if we were to move as one, do you really think Daniela could hold her ground? We&#39;ve been generous to the younger crowd, yet she walks as if she&#39;s untouchable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smile stretched wider as he noticed Richard&#39;s brow crease. His voice remained light, but the weight behind it was unmistakable. &#34;We&#39;re just concerned about Alexander&#39;s future. The Bennett family has already seen its fair share of hardships. You, more than anyone, know what it&#39;s like to fight through adversity. Would you truly want your son and his future wife to keep walking that same treacherous path?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s gaze flickered with a mix of emotions, his face giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett leaned in, his voice smooth, coaxing. &#34;We&#39;re extending a genuine invitation to Daniela to join our association. If she accepts, the Bennett family can come aboard too. We&#39;d be one big family. Doesn&#39;t that sound ideal? Why keep butting heads? Isn&#39;t pooling our strengths and making money together the smarter move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Hackett poured Richard a cup of coffee, his smile stretching even wider. &#34;Give it some thought, won&#39;t you? Can Daniela really take on all of us alone? And what&#39;s she even gaining from it anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard inhaled deeply, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts. He wasn&#39;t sure what Daniela&#39;s endgame was, but he had to admit-Hackett had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Profit was the priority. Stirring up hostility left and right wouldn&#39;t bode well for Alexander either. If Daniela married into the Bennett family, her enemies would inevitably become theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s frown deepened under the weight of the dilemma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his hesitation, Hackett gave a faint smile and patted Richard&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing, Richard. I hadn&#39;t brought this up before, but since we&#39;re having such a productive conversation today, I&#39;ll say it now. Your future daughter-in-law&#39;s strong-handed approach might start chipping away at your authority within the family.&#34; Richard parted his lips to reply, but Hackett smoothly cut in with a knowing smile. &#34;I get it-you don&#39;t mind.But as a father, are you truly fine with your son always playing second fiddle to a woman? If you and Daniela join our association, we&#39;re all reasonable men here. If any disputes arise in your family, we&#39;d be right there to back you up, mediate in your favor. Doesn&#39;t that sound like a win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s words seemed to ease the burden pressing on Richard&#39;s mind. His brows slowly relaxed. &#34;Fine.I&#39;ll talk to her. Daniela&#39;s taken things too far this time. We&#39;re all part of the same circle-there&#39;s no reason for this kind of hostility. No need to make life harder for each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, the others exchanged pleased smiles, their expressions bright with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Richard had left, a man beside Hackett leaned in and murmured, &#34;Do you really think Daniela will agree? She doesn&#39;t seem like someone who&#39;s easily swayed. Could it be that she&#39;s going after us because she&#39;s uncovered something about her mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett shut him down. &#34;Rubbish! What mother? Whose mother? That&#39;s got nothing to do with us!&#34;</p>
