                <p>The broken glass sliced through Daniela&#39;s hand, but she didn&#39;t react in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared coldly at Caiden. He had gotten so used to badmouthing Brylee in front of Katrina that he never considered the bitterness in his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, today was no different-he didn&#39;t hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he had forgotten, however, was one key detail-sitting across from him was Daniela, Brylee&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laugh echoed, cold and unsettling, sending a chill down Caiden&#39;s spine. Slowly,he stood up from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce, realizing that Caiden had messed up, hurried into the room, clearly desperate to defuse the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before either could speak, Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the silence. &#34;Caiden, if it weren&#39;t for my mother&#39;s efforts to build this family, do you think you&#39;d even have the privilege to sit here, spewing such garbage?Who do you think you are,talking about my mother like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face flushed with anger, his eyes flickering with fury, but he remained silent, not daring to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,you&#39;ve had a tough time, have you?&#34; Daniela sneered, her voice thick with sarcasm. &#34;You struggled to tear down everything my mother built. You were scared that Harper Group might actually succeed-scared people would see you for the failure you really are. Let&#39;s get one thing clear. Nothing will ever change the fact that you&#39;re nothing but a parasite, a freeloader, a pretty face who used his looks to marry my mother.You&#39;ve spent your whole life hiding behind a mask of false respectability, desperately clinging to a fragile ego. But it&#39;s all laughable. Everyone sees through it. You&#39;re not fit to be a husband, and you certainly don&#39;t have what it takes to be a father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face contorted with humiliation. Daniela&#39;s words had torn apart his pride in front of everyone. Consumed by rage and desperation, he lifted his hand, aiming to slap her and silence her once and for all.But before he could do it, an iron grip seized his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp jolt of pain surged through his wrist as he tried to break free, but the hold only tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sickening sound that echoed through the room. The unmistakable snap of bone broke the tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood there, under the harsh light, his expression unreadable. His cold gaze bore into Caiden, as though looking down at something insignificant. &#34;I recommend you don&#39;t try that again. Because next time,it won&#39;t stop at just a broken bone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce stood paralyzed, their faces drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina didn&#39;t dare to challenge Cedric, so she fumbled for her phone, dialing for an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she waited for the connection, she shot a look at Daniela.&#34;Daniela, no matter what, he&#39;s still your father.How could you allow someone like him to be hurt like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s thoughts seethed with frustration. What a pack of brutes! They couldn&#39;t have a civil conversation without resorting to violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, just smiled as she sat back down. &#34;Save your breath. I&#39;ve outgrown the need for father-daughter heart-to-heart talks. Your old tricks don&#39;t have any power over me anymore. Maybe it&#39;s time you come up with something new. By the way, I&#39;ve already sold the villa you recently purchased. The money&#39;s been deposited into the company&#39;s account. As for your offshore holdings, you&#39;ve got one week to bring them back. If you fal, I won&#39;t hesitate to have you arrested. Since the company&#39;s been running inefficiently,I&#39;ve already terminated all those &#39;family favors&#39; staff members to cut expenses. I suggest you find a way to bring in some revenue quickly. Personally, I don&#39;t mind if the company keeps bleeding money-I can take the hit. You, on the other hand, might not fare as well. If the company collapses, you&#39;ll be responsible for forty-d nine percent of the debt. That includes losing this villa. When that happens, perhaps you&#39;ll finally grasp the reality of having nowhere to call home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s body was drenched in cold sweat, the searing pain from his broken wrist almost too much to endure. Fighting through the fog of agony, he managed to lift his eyes towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold, unfeeling stare cut through him like a blade. The steady authority in her demeanor sent shivers down his spine. In that moment, it was as though Brylee herself had come back to life and was standing before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That chilling thought hit him like a ton of bricks, confirming his deepest, darkest fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very nightmare he had spent years avoiding had finally become a reality-Daniela had grown into the spitting image of her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t just like Brylee-she was colder, sharper, and even more merciless!</p>
