                <p>Daniela meticulously calculated the final settlement figures and presented Cedric with an impressive 80%profit margin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She further sweetened the deal by reserving five expansive floors in the upcoming skyscraper for Phillips Group&#39;s office space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, fervently punching numbers into his calculator,abruptly realized his oversight-his good fortune had inadvertently come at her expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out of the building, a veil of frustration shadowed his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numbers were her playground, and his skills simply couldn&#39;t match her extraordinary intellect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t hold back her frustration any longer.&#34;Honestly, Cedric, you&#39;re acting like a total coward!What&#39;s got you so terrified?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan observed the exchange with keen interest, his arms folded tightly against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian continued, &#34;Just open up to her! Admit you&#39;re smitten. You&#39;re clearly putting in the effort; so what&#39;s holding you back? See how she takes it! Or are you really just going to hide behind this &#39;just friends&#39;facade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s frustration reached its peak. &#34;I want to confess,I really do. But every time I approach her, her piercing gaze and her unyielding grasp of the data intimidate me. I&#39;m used to the rough and tumble of construction sites, not the sharp world of numbers.Each time I try to speak, her incisive stare cuts me off.What can I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian exhaled sharply, frustration evident in her voice.&#34;Cedric, I can&#39;t believe how shy you become around her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Cedric had departed, Lillian shook her head disapprovingly. Ryan, tilting his head and wearing a mischievous grin, inquired, &#34;Didn&#39;t you have reservations about Cedric before? You used to say he was too aloof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and my feelings haven&#39;t changed,&#34; Lillian retorted, her tone a mix of irritation and resignation.Daniela was a survivor of a troubled past. She wore a smile like a mask, yet beneath it, she was distant and detached,her childhood wounds far too deep for any wealth to mend.And Cedric? He had plunged into the corporate world on his own, adept at unmasking the true intentions of those around him. Could someone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like that truly possess warmth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notion of two such detached souls together seemed doomed. Rather than warming each other,they were likely to pull each other further into the cold. How could they possibly make a good match?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sighed, her voice softening. &#34;But watching Cedric act so humble, I can&#39;t help but feel a pang of pity for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, Cedric behaved as though he had the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such foolishness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her reflection ended, Lillian questioned Ryan,&#34;Why do you back Cedric so fiercely? Has he promised you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan drew his sweatshirt&#39;s hood over his head,casting his features into shadow. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because, on the day Daniela married, I saw him cry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned,Lillian fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Ryan turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood against the sharp, biting wind, her mind reeling from the unexpected sight of Cedric-a normally composed man-visibly crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was waiting for Daniela&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At breakfast, Richard had maintained his composure.&#34;Today,you need to ask Daniela whether she&#39;ll give you the contract, or if she intends to remain indebted to you. Should she choose the latter, suggest remarriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander bowed his head, his turbulent emotions now quelled. &#34;But the person Daniela cherished from her childhood wasn&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t who? It was you! Daniela has harbored feelings for you for many years. Does the truth even matter at this point? Feelings are the most deceiving of all. Don&#39;t let them lead you astray. Confront Daniela today. If she refuses, then marrying Joyce isn&#39;t such a terrible fallback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Richard always put the company first, he secretly believed that Daniela&#39;s affection for Alexander wasn&#39;t just a relic of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sentimental heart hadn&#39;t been hardened by their separation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She surely still held Alexander in high esteem. As long as she harbored love for him in her heart,there was hope that all could be mended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander avoided Elite Lux; he had no desire to have his true intentions discovered by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the knowledge that Daniela was due at a social function that evening, he cleverly picked the same restaurant to dine in, setting the stage for an inadvertent encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The construction team was already at the restaurant when Daniela walked in, her arrival leaving them momentarily speechless, captivated by her commanding aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the toast, Cedric presented her with a glass of juice and clinked his glass against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a conspiratorial grin, he leaned towards the foreman and whispered, &#34;Let&#39;s keep the evening light for her; alcohol tends to cloud her bright spirit.&#34; His voice dripped with an overt protective charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was common knowledge among the construction team that Cedric&#39;s involvement in thei project was deeply tied to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With genuine smiles, the workers toasted. &#34;Ms. Harper,we&#39;ll give it our all! You can rely on us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the president of a powerful and expansive company,Daniela graciously invited them to a lavish dinner.Her warm smile and effortless charm filled the room, though she knew full well that she couldn&#39;t prevent Cedric from visiting the site. This dinner was her subtle way of paving the path for him to earn the trust and camaraderie of the workers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco Pittman, the foreman, observed their interactions,his expression one of content satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening concluded with everyone feeling uplifted and jovial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela approached the counter to settle the bill,only to discover that Cedric had preemptively taken care of it. She then excused herself to the restroom,unaware that she was about to encounter Alexander upon her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes were cold as he fixed his gaze on Daniela. &#34;Are you seeing Cedric now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, completely sober, washed her hands before replying, &#34;Mr. Bennett, is there something you require?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s tone hardened as he pressed on. &#34;I asked you a question! Are you and Cedric seeing each other now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood Daniela&#39;s character deeply. Unless her heart was engaged, she wouldn&#39;t have a meal with a construction team to be near Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Daniela responded truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are your intentions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, Daniela replied calmly,&#34;Regarding what exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Concerning your feelings,&#34; Alexander stated,his stare penetrating. &#34;About us.&#34;</p>
