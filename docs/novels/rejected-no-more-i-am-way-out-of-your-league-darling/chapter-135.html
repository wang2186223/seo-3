                <p>Richard had always considered himself adept at gauging people&#39;s true nature, yet somehow, he had completely overlooked that Daniela was a top-tier CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, watching one lucrative opportunity after another slip through his fingers left him restless,haunting his nights with wakefulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gazed at Alexander, his expression a mix of urgency and frustration, silently wishing he could swap places with him and plead at Daniela&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Self-respect? Pride? What value do they hold nowadays?&#34; Richard&#39;s voice escalated with intensity.&#34;In the absence of wealth, they&#39;re worthless!Alexander, I&#39;m not compelling you to act, but I urge you to consider. Do you truly wish to sever all ties with Daniela permanently?&#34; In the days leading up to this conversation, Richard had briefly visited Joyce in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy had intensified her cravings, rounding out her formerly sharp features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard found himself unable to remain by her side for more than a few minutes, quickly excusing himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Joyce couldn&#39;t hold a candle to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try it one more time,&#34; Richard suggested, his tone carrying a subtle edge of expectation. &#34;Do you realize why Daniela managed to accomplish so much? Back in the day, when she pursued you, she was unconcerned about appearances. Regardless of the gossip or judgment, she never allowed it to deter her. Reflect on her past actions towards you. Isn&#39;t there a lesson to be learned from her perseverance?And consider this-perhaps Daniela is putting you through a test. With her newfound wealth, it&#39;s natural for her to be more guarded. Can&#39;t you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold detachment in Alexander&#39;s face slowly gave way to something softer. His gaze turned to Richard, a brief pause hanging in the air before he finally asked, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, although thrilled by the conversation,managed to maintain a composed demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded solemnly and responded, &#34;Absolutely.And it&#39;s not just me-others are saying the same.Just the other day, a friend of mine mentioned that Daniela, now positioned quite high up, might be using these tactics to test people&#39;s true intentions.He even asked me to pass on a message: don&#39;t get discouraged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, having played the role of Alexander&#39;s father for so many years, was well aware of his son&#39;s Achilles&#39; heel-his pride. To Alexander, his self-esteem was paramount, overshadowing all else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deliberate choice of Richard&#39;s words seemed to unravel Alexander&#39;s pent-up frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rooted to the spot, Alexander clenched his fists tightly, then slowly uncurled them. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll give it another try.&#34; A flicker of relief passed through Richard&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s demeanor stiffened abruptly, his voice sharpening as he went on, &#34;If Daniela still doesn&#39;t give a damn about my efforts, then screw her-l won&#39;t hold back anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard responded, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. After the distance you&#39;ve put between you and Daniela, she&#39;s bound to have noticed that she upset you last time. Plus, we secured that small bid, right? There&#39;s a project progress meeting this afternoon.It&#39;s not really tied to us, but you should go anyway. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to see Daniela and break the awkward tension.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing for a moment, Richard nervously rubbed his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander delayed any longer, Daniela might erase him from her thoughts completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her wealth at her disposal, she had the freedom to choose from a wide array of suitors-kind-hearted,passionate, and untamed alike. She truly had the world at her feet. If Alexander didn&#39;t take actions, he would be forgotten by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander headed upstairs to choose a suit,Richard let out a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention then turned to his buzzing phone.Katrina&#39;s name lit up the screen. Without a second thought, he swiped to decline the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a load of crap!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was a complete wreck, yet Katrina still dared to consider marrying her to Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utterly pathetic!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the hospital, Katrina let out a laugh tinged with disbelief as her call was dismissed.&#34;Really? What&#39;s so terrible about the Bennett family now? Oh, so I&#39;m the one groveling to them now, is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, seated beside her, didn&#39;t look up from his phone, where he was absorbed in the latest financial headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The growth of Elite Lux in recent months had been impressive, and Caiden found comfort in the figures dancing on his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, nothing else was of consequence. His primary concern was preserving the Harper family fortune, ensuring Katrina didn&#39;t fritter it away as Joyce&#39;s wedding gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By maintaining control over their assets, he could secure a future where Daniela, endowed with wealth,would ensure his comfort in his later years.</p>
