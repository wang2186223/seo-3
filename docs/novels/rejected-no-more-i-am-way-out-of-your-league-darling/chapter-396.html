                <p>The moment Daniela&#39;s words echoed in the room, a wave of shock swept over everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives of Phillips Group were stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s unexpected boldness in stepping up to represent Phillips Group caught them off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her actions today didn&#39;t just reflect her own intentions:they subtly signaled to the public that Harper Group and Elite Lux would back all future business ventures of Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives of Phillips Group regarded her with a newfound appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, it seemed like Daniela would give a few courteous remarks and end the press conference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,to everyone&#39;s shock, she spoke again with certainty.&#34;From today until Cedric recovers,I will take complete control over managing Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as those words escaped her, the previously hectic scene came to a complete standstill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People froze in disbelief, their eyes widening as they  turned to stare at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was measured and unwavering,each word cutting through the air with precision. &#34;It&#39;s clear someone has malicious plans to bring down Phillips Group. If that&#39;s the case, then bring it on. I didn&#39;t start this,but I won&#39;t shy away from it either. The first move has been made, and there&#39;s no turning back now.We&#39;ll see this through to the end, together. I&#39;m ready to face whatever comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was quietly observing from the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been eagerly waiting for Daniela to crack,hoping to see her break down in tears, lost and helpless,crushed by despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had planned to use the chaos to take Daniela down just as she had with Brylee, but she hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to boldly declare war before the cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse leaned in and murmured something to a reporter nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, the reporter raised his hand, asking, &#34;Ms.Harper,you mentioned taking over the management of Phillips Group starting today. Has this been approved by the senior members of Phillips Group, or is this just your own ambition?&#34; question seemed to stir the room, catching the ention of the reporters present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ou&#39;re undoubtedly capable, Ms. Harper,but this is illips Group we&#39;re talking about. Would they accept outsider&#39;s interference?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hillips Group has become a powerhouse,with many erlapping interests with Elite Lux. Couldn&#39;t they be orried about competition impacting their business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he reporters&#39; questions were pointed and hard-itting, grabbing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>midst the commotion, an executive of Phillips Group poke. &#34;Let me share my thoughts. I&#39;ve been with the ompany for more than ten years, serving as the inance director. With Mr. Phillips facing an wnexpected crisis, we deeply appreciate Ms. Harper&#39;s Jbunwavering support. We trust her completely, and with her leadership, we are confident in our path forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the outside world might be unaware, everyone inside Phillips Group knew of Cedric&#39;s ongoing pursuit of Daniela. They had all seen firsthand the depth of his feelings for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the unpredictable world of business, it was a rarity to find someone who stepped forward to offer help during such a turbulent time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s readiness to take charge and support Phillips Group in such a stormy moment was met with sincere gratitude by all within the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the crowd, a cold voice broke through. It came from a man in a black hat and mask. &#34;Oh, is that so?The executives of Phillips Group might be confident,but what about the investors? Daniela isn&#39;t even part of Phillips Group. Are you conspiring with her to push Cedric out while he&#39;s in a coma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room, which had been quiet, suddenly erupted into heated discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,this kind of thing isn&#39;t unheard of. Who knows if Daniela is using Cedric&#39;s illness to get what she wants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The executives seem to be going along with it.Maybe they&#39;ve been bribed by Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t that spell disaster for Phillips Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, businessmen these days only care about money, and Daniela is known as one of the best at what she does. Isn&#39;t that clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives of Phillips Group didn&#39;t know how to respond as the situation spiraled out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm as she addressed the room.&#34;Can someone tell me which reporter just labeled me an outsider to Cedric and Phillips Group?&#34; Her words stunned the crowd below the stage into  silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Elite Lux&#39;s power, Daniela held significant sway.Whispering behind her back was one thing, but who would dare openly challenge her? Only someone foolish enough to invite disaster would dare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd recoiled, too intimidated to voice their thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives of Phillips Group seethed silently,cursing the troublemakers in their midst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela surveyed the room, her face a mask of seriousness. &#34;So no one will own up to it? Should I review the surveillance footage? Let me find out which reporter called me an outsider to Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she finished, Ryan made his way to check the footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, a hand shot up from the crowd,and a wiry man with a sharp face stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was a mix of challenge and resignation as he said, &#34;I said it. Did I say something out of line?Everyone knows Mr. Phillips has been pursuing you,but you&#39;ve never returned his feelings, have you? How is that not being an outsider? Am I mistaken? If so,prove me wrong and show the proof.&#34;</p>
