                <p>Five recordings had surfaced online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one contained what was unmistakably Cedric&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, alarmed, clicked on the suddenly popular recordings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett, I&#39;m responsible for those misogynistic comments about you online. What are you going to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is my wife, and with her support, I&#39;m untouchable in Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as we&#39;re married, she&#39;s my shield. Merely by being her husband, I command respect and open doors throughout Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett,you value your daughters,but to what end?You&#39;ve lost your influence. If you don&#39;t want to face bankruptcy or worse-seeing your daughters end up in a nightclub-then they better followmy lead.Why the tears, Hackett? Being associated with me should be seen as an honor for your daughters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight, bring your three daughter to Room 1308,Night Lounge Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The release of these recordings dominated the trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Servers were overwhelmed and crashed for almost thirty minutes due to the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,protected by Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Divorce Daniela and Set Her Free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This plea quickly climbed the rankings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR team from Phillips Group arrived in a rush,confronting Cedric with serious expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Phillips, did these words really come from you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our technical experts have verified these recordings.They&#39;re authentic, just like the high-definition video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,we need your response.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had cultivated a reputation as a business prodigy admired by many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His followers idolized him and struggled to reconcile the man they admired with the villain portrayed in the media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Ryan was trying to access hospital security  footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could find that footage, it could confirm Cedric&#39;s alibi-that he was at the hospital that night, not at the Night Lounge Hotel as claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s hands shook as he navigated the security system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his struggle,Daniela took over the computer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers danced rapidly across the keyboard, but after a few tense minutes, the screen displayed a frustrating message, saying, &#34;The requested page is not archived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela briefly closed her eyes, sensing that their adversary had meticulously planned their moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After passing the computer back to Ryan, she approached the doorway, surveying the Phillips Group staff assembled below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your shock and your anger. As Cedric&#39;s wife,l,too,was stunned by these accusations online.But I ask you to have faith in my husband. He is a wonderful man,and I implore you to allow us the time to gather evidence and clear his name. Please, stand with Cedric and me during this challenging time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wade Blake, from the tech department and a long-time admirer of Daniela, stepped forward. &#34;Ms.Harper,  do you truly stand by Mr. Phillips? You know the technology better than any of us. You&#39;ve seen the videos. They&#39;re real, aren&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded in acknowledgment. &#34;The footage online hasn&#39;t been altered, but the man in them isn&#39;t Cedric. I realize how difficult this is to believe, and all I ask is for a little time. We will vindicate him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s appeal, in light of the compelling evidence against them, seemed weak at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some staff members suspected she was sacrificing her integrity to protect Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, they returned to their duties, motivated not by the scandal but by their longstanding respect for Phillips Group and the decent treatment they had always received.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The undeniable nature of the online evidence seemed almost final,leaving scant opportunity for defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the living room, the team gathered, their expressions troubled as they strategized their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lingered for a moment before heading to the kitchen to prepare some food for the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, the PR manager and several members of Phillips Group&#39;s tech team arrived, laptops in tow, ready to collaborate on strategies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room became a makeshift command center, filled with several team members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela served the food she prepared, and a heavy silence fell as they ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the intense of online debates showed no signs of fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security chief from Phillips Group reported that vandals had thrown garbage at their office building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela accessed the internet, clicking on the most trending topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline read, &#34;Cedric, Apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos reigned throughout the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Journalists from every major national newspaper staked out the buildings of both Phillips Group and Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, the stock price of Phillips Group plummeted,hitting the daily limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the afternoon, more than a hundred business partners had called to sever their contracts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unjust boycott impacted all celebrities affiliated with Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Major retailers removed all Phillips Group products from their shelves, exacerbating the crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group descended from corporate dominance to public enemy overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was widely accepted that recovery was impossible for the company this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed destined to carry a permanent mark of disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s official website was swarming with comments like, &#34;Daniela, divorce him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Top executives at Elite Lux headquarters quickly became involved as the crisis escalated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moodwas grim among the PR and tech teams at Phillips Group; online trolls savagely attacked every public statement they issued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what&#39;s our next move? The trolls are relentless!&#34; Lillian asked, overwhelmed by the onslaught of online attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm demeanor, Daniela suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s pause for a moment. I need to rest for half an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR and tech team at Phillips Group were speechless. How could she be sleeping at a time like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, ever supportive, draped a blanket over Daniela and signaled for quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suggested,&#34;Why not take this time to rest as well?We have guest rooms ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exchanging suspicious glances, the team was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rest at such a time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep was out of the question!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on the heels of a previous mess, Phillips Group was floundering once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their jobs were hanging by a thread!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Falling asleep under such stress was unthinkable.</p>
