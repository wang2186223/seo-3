                <p>Joyce pursed her lips and gave a silent nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina briefly closed her eyes, letting out a long,slow breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clutched her mother&#39;s hand, her voice shaky.&#34;Mom, the doctor said if I go through with the abortion, I may never be able to have children again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, taking a moment to think over her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After tonight, the Bennett family will be watching your every move. You&#39;ll have to find someone else to marry,&#34; Katrina said, fixing Joyce with a firm look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes grew wide with confusion.&#34;What? Who would I marry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind flickered back to that night at the bar-everything was a blur through the haze of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing had been clear to her in that fog of drunkenness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing she could remember was waking up the next morning, catching a glimpse of someone slipping out the door. She vaguely recalled a mole on the back of his neck, but everything else was a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander&#39;s off the table,&#34; Katrina muttered under her breath. &#34;You need someone stable, someone reliable. In all of Olisvine, Cedric is your best bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hesitated, biting her lip nervously. &#34;But would he even say yes? He barely even talks to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her situation was sinking in. Pregnant,unmarried, and no clue who the father was-if people found out, she&#39;d become the subject of ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina looked at her daughter&#39;s panicked, bewildered expression and let out a deep, resigned sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Cedric refuses, we&#39;ll find someone else willing to marry into our family. That way, your father and I can ensure you&#39;re taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rested her chin in her hand, pondering it.&#34;Then I&#39;ll go with Cedric. Life&#39;s too long to waste on someone I can&#39;t even tolerate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that anyone desperate enough to marry into their family probably wouldn&#39;t be much of a prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had always been pampered, putting her own comfort above everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared at her daughter in silence for a moment,completely at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, she sighed again, her voice soft.&#34;Let mne handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove home, Richard glanced over at Alexander and asked, &#34;Joyce is pregnant, it seems.What&#39;s your take on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stomach the idea of losing the Harper family&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,with her impulsive, naive nature, was easy to manipulate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina had warned, trying to control Daniela the way they controlled Joyce was futile. Daniela was not someone they could bend to their will-not now,not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed silent, his eyes glued to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard leaned back in the back seat, his voice calm and detached. &#34;Honestly, whether there&#39;s a child or not, it doesn&#39;t really matter to me. You don&#39;t love her,after all. Just treat it like taking in a stray animal-don&#39;t let it complicate things. As for who you choose to be with outside of this marriage, that&#39;s entirely up to you. I won&#39;t get in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Alexander. &#34;So? What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, clearly uninterested, didn&#39;t look up from his phone as he answered,&#34;Whatever you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long given up any hopes or expectations for marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was Daniela or Joyce-it was just exchanging one face for another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, there was no real difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how he had always seen it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as he sat there, loosening his tie,he convinced himself that nothing had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander outright rejected it, Richard would push even harder. But when Alexander agreed without hesitation, Richard hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it two weeks,&#34; Richard said after a beat. &#34;If nothing comes of you and Daniela by then, youcan marry Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pregnancy didn&#39;t matter. Joyce&#39;s family would make up for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Richard&#39;s view, it was hardly a bad deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened between Alexander and Joyce after the marriage? That wasn&#39;t his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Richard looked out the window, his mind wandering in its own direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he had sent Lillian to gauge Daniela&#39;s feelings,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t look away from his phone, his focus locked on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time ever, a hint of fear flickered within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paced restlessly across the familiar construction site,where he was known to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the site supervisor passing by,Cedric called out, &#34;Marco, got a smoke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco Pittman, a no-nonsense guy, grinned as he dug into his pocket. &#34;Well, well, I didn&#39;t expect you to ask for a smoke,&#34; he remarked with his thick accent,pulling out a cigarette and offering it to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The workers regularly offered Cedric cigarettes,but he always declined. Most people thought he didn&#39;t smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, here he was now, sitting down on the ground with a cigarette in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wearing his hard hat, he leaned back, staring up at the skyscraper towering before him, its sharp edges cutting into the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a satisfied smile, Marco said, &#34;This year&#39;s shaping up nicely. We&#39;ll have something to celebrate come the New Year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed quiet, lost in his thoughts. Marco turned to him, grinning. &#34;Mr. Phillips, you&#39;re young,but you&#39;ve got the work ethic.&#34; He flashed a big thumbs-up, then added, &#34;Not many guys like you these days-down-to -earth and dependable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a faint smile, the cigarette still smoldering between his fingers, not yet touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But honestly, with your status as a CEO, what are you doing out here? I saw your name in the financial news.You&#39;re handling deals worth billions. So what brings you to the site?&#34; Marco asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile lingered as he tilted his head back, his gaze fixed on the towering structure before him. A glimmer of a smile flickered in his eyes,as though he could already see Daniela stepping into the building -radiant,confident,and completely untouched by the wind or rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anyone behind me. Everything I&#39;ve built,I did it step by step, with hard work and setbacks.I&#39;ve been reckless before and spent lavishly on sports cars and mansions. Had it all, but none of it felt meaningful.&#34; His crisp white shirt was streaked with dirt, but it didn&#39;t seem to bother him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was such honesty in Cedric&#39;s voice; it didn&#39;t come across as boasting. It felt more raw, more sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cigarette burned down to the filter in his hand,but he hadn&#39;t taken a single drag. He snuffed it out on the ground and said, &#34;But this project I&#39;m working on,this one feels meaningful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the warmth of the morning sun, Cedric shared something personal with someone he barely knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco laughed, giving Cedric a hearty slap on the back. &#34;You remind me of myself when I was chasing after my wife years ago. So, who&#39;s the lucky girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scratched his head, thinking it might be someone from the site. &#34;But that doesn&#39;t make sense. With your looks and status, why would you go through all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft chuckle. &#34;She&#39;s beyond amazing She&#39;s so extraordinary that just thinking about her feels almost wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco let out a low whistle, teasing, &#34;Sounds like you&#39;re chasing an angel straight from the heavens!&#34;</p>
