                <p>The room was alive with conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Ryan were leisurely playing cards with a few others, not currently focused on expanding their business,so they appeared quite at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Nina was feeling tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headlines in the news were specifically pointed and alarming, making her uneasy just to read them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, aren&#39;t you concerned?&#34; she asked. &#34;The commerce association is scheming against you. They plan to gather all domestic companies to boycottus.They&#39;ve been attracting a lot of new members.If they consolidate all that business power, won&#39;t Elite Luxbe in a difficult position?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s complexion was tinged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a casual smile, &#34;Two pairs!That&#39;s a win for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian, sitting opposite, had their faces covered by sticky notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela remain jovial, Nina sighed and exited  the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,when do we make our move?&#34; Lillian asked,mixing the cards again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s wait a few more days, let things escalate-it&#39;ll be more fun then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Nina re-entered and informed Daniela, &#34;Someone is here to see you downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it might be those boring folks from the association.Bored, she decided to head downstairs to see what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, it wasn&#39;t them but Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lighting that day was favorable, and Daniela recognized him instantly despite his all-black attire and hat pulled down over his face, nearly hiding it entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding the situation dull, Daniela turned to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hurried after her. &#34;I need to speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced Alexander, visibly confused. &#34;Why do you keep appearing like this? What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a senseof urgency, Alexander begged, &#34;Just give me five minutes. I truly have something important to discuss with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby was filled with activity. Daniela was unperturbed by the crowd, but she was bothered by Alexander&#39;s decision to wear Cedric&#39;s face and act recklessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found a quiet spot and sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander came and sat beside her. &#34;Daniela, I was wrong before. I didn&#39;t appreciate you. After all this time,do you still resent me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;No.&#34; That was the simple truth. She just found it all very bothersome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were never that close, and now I have a husband who gets quite jealous. I want to keep him happy every day. Your presence would only disturb him.&#34;Daniela looked at Alexander. &#34;Nobody wants to see his face worn by another. My husband might be forgiving, but I&#39;m not. I believe everything about my husband should be exclusive to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt a pang of pain at her words. He managed a weak smile. &#34;Daniela, remember how you used to stand up for me? You made me unique gifts for my birthday, insisting they had to be unique.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, those sentiments were being used to defend anot her man, and it saddened Alexander. &#34;But it&#39;s okay. We have a long future ahead,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression showed her growing impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander reached into his pocket and took out a bank transfer device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed it warily. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander explained, &#34;Daniela, perhaps you no longer care for me, but you&#39;re still the only one in my heart.I won&#39;t dwell on the past. I&#39;m just asking for a place in your future. This device lets you access funds from Fairburne Group as needed. I know you&#39;re being targeted by the association. I don&#39;t know your current strategy, but money is always useful. It could help you execute whatever plans you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was earnest, but Daniela remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I don&#39;t need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be so stubborn?&#34; Alexander frowned. &#34;I get that you&#39;re still upset with me, but let&#39;s leave the past behind. Why jeopardize your business just to spite me? The association is seriously challenging you.This money could keep your operations going. If things really get bad, you could relocate your company overseas. Also, I spoke with Hackett before coming here. He&#39;s agreed to give you a day to withdraw from the domestic market. He</p>
                
                
                
                <p>promised me, and he&#39;ll keep his word. Daniela,consider this. You&#39;ve achieved so much as a woman in this tough environment. Don&#39;t aim too high. I&#39;ve witnessed your efforts, and I acknowledge them.Can&#39;t we leave it at that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s words were heartfelt and emotional.&#34;Daniela, please, come back to me. I&#39;ll value you. Let&#39;s start anew,shall we?&#34;</p>
