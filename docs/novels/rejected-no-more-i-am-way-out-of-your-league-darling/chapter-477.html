                <p>Ryan was brought back home. and Lillian was waiting for him at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who were you out drinking with to end up like this?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan,who had vomited twice during the ride home.was somewhat more clear-headed now.&#34;Cedric,&#34;he managed to say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian paused briefly in surprise. &#34;Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan confirmed with a nod.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t Cedric known for not pressuring others to drink?How did you get so drunk?&#34; Lillian asked, helping Ryan as they entered the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan appeared unusually proud of himself,though Lillian couldn&#39;t understand why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan boasted,&#34;Besides Daniela, I&#39;m the most important person to Cedric. You jealous, Lillian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even while drunk, he couldn&#39;t resist showing off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian chose not to argue with someone who was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lillian assisted Ryan inside, Daniela was drinL! some water.Noticing Ryan being supported,she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was out drinking with Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian confirmed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took another sip of water and looked over at Ryan&#39;s state. &#34;Is he completely wasted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan held up two fingers. &#34;He threw up twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, pausing briefly. &#34;And Cedric? Is he drunk as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing her question, Ryan squinted,leaning on Lillian&#39;s shoulder, thinking for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,he shut his eyes and responded to Daniela.&#34;No.Cedric can drink everyone under the table,never showing even a flush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was aware that Cedric could handle his alcohol well</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,what was Cedric&#39;s motive for getting Ryan drunk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian set Ryan down on the couch and exchanged a look of understanding with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet moment passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian exhaled deeply. &#34;Ryan may be great at games,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but when it comes to strategy, Cedric is unmatched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set her water glass down slowly.Lillian said, &#34;Tomorrow, I&#39;ll tell Ryan to avoid drinking  sessions with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated before adding, &#34;I&#39;m just not sure what all he ended up revealing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ryan woke up, he struggled to sit up, only to nearly jump back in fear. &#34;Daniela? Lillian? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her hand,Daniela held a fruit knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was holding a hammer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you tell Cedric when you were out drinking last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan looked confused and instead asked, &#34;How did I end up home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no memory of the return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exhaled, set the fruit knife aside, and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, as Daniela approached the company.Linden was already at the entrance of the Elite Lux building,waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Linden saw Daniela, he mirrored Lillian&#39;s usual greeting and called out, &#34;Good morning,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a brief look and walked into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elyse and Natalie are waiting in your office. I think they&#39;re here because they&#39;ve run out of money anc  are likely to ask you for some.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela heard this, she looked at Linden and quickly understood what he was suggesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a smirk. &#34;Why? You interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden laughed, bowing his head and responding humbly, &#34;It&#39;s straightforward talking to someone as sharp as you. You miss nothing. I&#39;ve been interestedin Natalie for many years. Even though her status has fallen, I still find her quite appealing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike those women who exchanged their morality for personal gain and became impure. Natalie was raised in wealth,wwhich made her naturally more attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a slight smile but remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator,Linden knelt down. &#34;Consider me as your slave, ready to undertake any task you need.I pledge my loyalty to you going forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. As the elevator doors opened.she stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden could tell that Daniela had agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela walked into her office, Elyse stood up from her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, there&#39;s beena massive misunderstanding!You&#39;ve really misunderstood me, your dear aunt.Everything I said in the hotel was just to mislead  Linden.You know I&#39;m the most compassionate person in the world. And because of this, I often get taken advantage of. Your mother always showed me particular kindness for this reason.Daniela,if your mom could see from heaven how you&#39;re treating me,she&#39;d be devastated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was deeply in debt and saw no escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had hired someone to assassinate Daniela,but nothing came of it. The person she paid kept insisting that the payment was insufficient, fooling her in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time. Elyse exploded in anger only for the other party tosay.&#34;I was merely playing you.You&#39;re just now figuring that out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villathe designer handbags. and all other luxury items had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was devastated, nearly driven to madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve been misled by a scammer. They&#39;ve taken myvilla and all my valuables. You have to stand up for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat at her desk, her gaze fixed with cold intensity on Elyse&#39;s dishonest face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out a nervous laugh, while Natalie, standing next to her, kept a cold, composed expression. Daniela rested her chin on her hand. &#34;Really? So you were scammed? Does that mean you didn&#39;t plan my mother&#39;s assassination?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued,&#34;Was that time not part of your plan, for me to end up in Linden&#39;s bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was filled with regret. &#34;It was all justa huge misunderstanding. Everything got completely misunderstood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression appeared sincere. To anyone watching,her distress would likely seem real</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what can we do?&#34; Daniela smiled faintly,her voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;Natalie, you ended up sleeping with Linden,didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was already deeply embarrassed by the situation. She clenched her teeth and glared at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely laughed and glanced at Elyse&#39;s stiff smile. &#34;It was all a misunderstanding, but what can we do now? Can you reclaim what&#39;s been lost?&#34;</p>
