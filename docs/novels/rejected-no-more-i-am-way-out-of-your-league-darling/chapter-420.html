                <p>Daniela sat at her desk, her hands resting motionless before her. Her eyes, sharp and distant, fixed on Nina. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years ago, Aunt Brylee managed to secure a national agency for a major brand. She became the wealthiest person in the country. My mother,acting on someone&#39;s orders, reached out to Katrina,who was then working as a maid in your home. She promised that after the celebration banquet, a hypnotist would be brought in to make Aunt Brylee jump off a building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers curled around the edge of the desk,tightening with unspoken fury. &#34;Who gave the orders to Elyse? How long has this been in the making?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lip, her gaze falling to the floor before slowly lifting to meet Daniela&#39;s. A trace of pity flickered in her eyes. &#34;My mother always spoke with that person in private. Neither Natalie nor I have ever met him, but I overheard my mother call him Mr.Perry... It felt like an organization, not just a man. As for how long this plan has been brewing...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hesitated, her eyes flickering up to gauge Daniela&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t place, Daniela&#39;s cold calmness at that moment felt like the stillness before an inevitable storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The scheme to eliminate your mother began the moment Caiden got close to your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of his name, Daniela&#39;s grip on the table tightened instantly. &#34;Are you saying Caiden was a pawn? That he was sent to seduce my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave a small nod. &#34;I overheard my mother talking about how, as Aunt Brylee&#39;s business grew,those people sent many to get close to her. But none succeeded until your father appeared. That&#39;s when Aunt Brylee fell for him.&#34; Daniela&#39;s hand began to tremble, her control slipping as the weight of Nina&#39;s words sank in. The room, so large and spacious, suddenly felt stifling. She had long resigned herself to the idea of Caiden&#39;s betrayal, but hearing it spoken aloud twisted a fresh pang of pain through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Brylee truly gave her heart to Caiden. They say there&#39;s no deeper pain than betrayal from someone you love. On the day she passed, my mother showed her a video. Aunt Brylee had drunk heavily at the banquet, and in that state, she was easy prey for the hypnotist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela absorbed each word in silence, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman betrayed by both her husband and sister. In the face of such treachery, Brylee was manipulated,walking blindly towards her demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had Brylee thought as she left this world? Was she aware of the manipulations behind her fate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what of Caiden? Had he ever felt remorse for what he&#39;d done, even once, during all the years that passed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,Daniela returned to the Harper family home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the yard, Caiden basked in the warmth of the sun,looking completely at ease. When he spotted Daniela, his face lit up with exaggerated enthusiasm.&#34;Ah, my dear daughter. I hear you&#39;ve been making waves, starting new companies left and right.Everyone&#39;s talking about you. I&#39;m so proud! Now that you&#39;re rolling in wealth, how about raising my monthly allowance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could respond to Caiden, Cedric arrived, breathless from his hurried rush. His sharp eyes immediately spotted the fruit knife Daniela had tucked into her coat pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, Cedric&#39;s here too, I heard you married Daniela?Well, now I&#39;m your father-in-law, so don&#39;t forget to support me, too,&#34; Caiden said with a grin, completely oblivious to the tension building in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, still uneasy, moved closer to Daniela, his gaze filled with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some individuals, no matter how turbulent their emotions, possessed a calmness that seemed untouched by the storm inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was such a person. The more furious she felt, the more composed she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a flicker of emotion, Cedric exclaimed,&#34;Shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was insignificant to Cedric, but he was deeply concerned about Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s past struggles with depression lingered in Cedric&#39;s mind. If Caiden&#39;s words pushed her too far,Cedric would not wait for her to act. He would take matters into his own hands and end Caiden himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to help her rest, Cedric escorted Daniela upstairs for a nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric finally awoke, the night had fallen. His hand reached for the space beside him, but it was cold. The absence of Daniela&#39;s warmth sent a ripple of unease through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart pounded as panic set in. With urgency,he threw off the covers and rushed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first floor, typically aglow with light, was now shrouded in unsettling darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric descended, the moonlight outside illuminated a tense scene: Daniela sat rigidly on the sofa, staring at Caiden, who was bound to a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric prepared to move forward, Lillian and Ryan stepped in his path and raised their hands to halt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has her own way of handling things. You promised her that, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
