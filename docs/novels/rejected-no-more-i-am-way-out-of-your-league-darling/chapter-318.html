                <p>The argument between Joyce and Katrina had escalated to a level neither of them had ever reached before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really not going to help me? You&#39;re my mother! If I can&#39;t pay this debt, I&#39;m finished. I&#39;m your only daughter, and you still won&#39;t step in? Grandma doesn&#39;t have enough to lend, maybe a million at most. That&#39;s barely a drop in the ocean when it comes to the interest!&#34; Joyce yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;I&#39;m doing everything I can to find a solution. But don&#39;t expect me to sell myself just to fix this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s temper flared, her words sharp and bitter.&#34;Why not? Whether it&#39;s Caiden or anyone else, it is the same!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap that followed was sharp and resounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Joyce stood frozen, stunned by the force of the strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand pressed against the stinging skin, and Joyce glared at Katrina with cold fury. &#34;Fine. If you won&#39;t help, I&#39;ll figure it out on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stormed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stood in the doorway, her eyes following Joyce as she stormed out. A deep, exhausted sigh escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day,Katrina made the decision to leave the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was to approach Daniela once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Katrina faced Daniela, her words came out stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, if I divorce your father, what will you give me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up from her phone, Daniela replied, &#34;Nothing. If you want out, you leave with nothing.&#34;The weight of her words sank in, and Katrina knew the conversation had come to a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bitter glance at Daniela, Katrina turned and made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed, and Joyce vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the wake of it all, Daniela&#39;s grip on the Harper family&#39;s wealth tightened, leaving Caiden with no influence,completely powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s financial situation had hit rock bottom, her funds barely enough to keep her afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, a million dollars appeared in her bank account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sinking feeling twisted in Katrina&#39;s stomach as soon as she saw the deposit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she checked the details of the transfer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Joyce&#39;s name was displayed on the screen, confirming her suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message accompanying the transfer sent a clear message. &#34;Repayment, with interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina got it right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was severing all ties, cutting the last thread between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbled inside Katrina as she tried reaching out, but there was no clue where to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a moment of desperation, Katrina held Daniela back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at her coldly.′′SO1now you finally know what it feels liketo lose someone who matters,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a cold sensation swept through Katrina&#39;s chest. Her eyes flickered.&#34;Daniela, are you telling me you planned all of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;Joyce made her own choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina didn&#39;t believe her. She asked Daniela, &#34;Did you send Joyce away?&#34; Daniela just smiled and stayed silent, the quiet saying more than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s mind raced, flooded with countless theories about Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, they all fell apart in the face of truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the banquet for Daniela&#39;s new company, Katrina mindlessly held a glass of wíne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, a waiter appeared at the door, his voice respectful as he called out, &#34;Mrs. Fairburne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was about to turn when a group of women near her started whispering and giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s really throwing her life away for money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you notice how tightly she&#39;s wrapped? There are probably marks alI over her skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, marrying Doug is no small feat. She must have some remarkable strategies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doug is worth billions and spends without a care. In Olisvine, only Daniela could rival him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet, she&#39;s coming this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a perfectly timed chorus, the women around them all greeted her. &#34;Mrs. Fairburne!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, everyone,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice, smooth and undeniably familiar, sliced through the air, carrying a hint of a husky tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s body tensed. With a stiff movement, she turned to face the source of the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three months had passed since Joyce had vanished without a trace. Now, she was Doug&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit Katrina all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Joyce&#39;s disappearance, Erika had never once mentioned Doug&#39;s name to Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Katrina offered Erika money, she&#39;d dismiss it with a simple, &#34;Keep it for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Katrina assumed her mother was upset with her. But soon, she found Erika had bought a luxury house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit Katrina like a lightning bolt-Erika must have introduced another woman to that wealthy man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, Katrina hadn&#39;t even considered Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Doug had pursued her first, and she never imagined Joyce would take such a drastic step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A step so bold, even Katrina herself would never dare to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s body shook under the weight of the revelation. She approached Joyce and asked, &#34;Joyce, have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce met her gaze with an cold stare, unfazed by the harsh question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd around them parted like the Red Sea, creating a clear path for Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, do you even realize what you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gave Katrina a subtle smile, her confidence unshaken.′′∥Venever been more certain of what I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If degrading herself meant a lifetime of luxury and admiration, she would embrace the title of Mrs. Fairburne without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the life she had chosen, and she was prepared to live it forever.</p>
