                <p>Cedric held back his question, reluctant to hear the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela admitted that she treated all her suitors in the same manner, Cedric feared he wouldn&#39;t withstand such a revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t take long for Cedric to know the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to a tight schedule, Daniela couldn&#39;t venture far for lunch and met Alexander at the restaurant just below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How unfortunate. The cuisine is superb at the other spot. Perhaps next time, I can show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes drifted momentarily to a nearby table, spotting Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric. Her lips twitched into a fleeting smile. &#34;The quality of a meal depends on the company. Also, there&#39;s no need for small talk.Just say what you need to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s usual stern facade softened into a look of mild regret. &#34;So I guess I&#39;m no longer the one you love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was aware that if she didn&#39;t settle this now, Alexander would undoubtedly revisit the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting the silence linger, she leaned back slightly. Cedric&#39;s image surfaced in her mind, quietly stealing her focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander detected Daniela&#39;s indifference, and a wave of disappointment washed over him, mingling with a sense of loss. &#34;Daniela, do you remember-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cut off mid-sentence as Daniela subtly raised her hand, her demeanor courteous yet detached.&#34;Let&#39;s drop the nostalgia and get straight to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression changed, the smile dissolving as a trace of tension settled into his features. &#34;Of course. I merely thought those days held some charm worth revisiting. I didn&#39;t intend to make you A slight, icy smile crept onto Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just that reflecting on the past seems somewhat pointless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw, a subtle indication of his inner turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sensed her dismissive tone and knew pressing the issue could only lead to embarrassment. Yet,a bitter resolve bubbled up within him, prompting him to attempt another topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, no more about the past then. Marlin visited you today, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a brief nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a voice that carried a hint of desperation, Alexander continued, &#34;And what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze locked onto his, unwavering and cold. Her voice carried a sharp edge, each word deliberate.&#34;I don&#39;t make a habit of revisiting old relationships. And you shouldn&#39;t either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s jaw tightened, his expression hardening further. &#34;Haven&#39;t you given Cedric the chance to pursue you? If you can accept his advances, then why not mine? Isn&#39;t our history deeper than yours with him? Tell me,Daniela,why him and not me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter chuckle escaped her lips, cutting through the tension in the room like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked momentarily to Cedric, who had just stepped away to speak with his secretary.&#34;Alexander,we&#39;re both seasoned players in the business world. While I&#39;ve never held Bennett Group in high regard, I&#39;ve tried to show you some basic civility. But since you&#39;re so determined to push, let me be brutally honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, her words laced with icy disdain. &#34;You and Cedric couldn&#39;t be more different.When Cedric says he wants to pursue me, he&#39;s genuine-his intentions are clear, without pretense. But you? What you&#39;re after isn&#39;t affection. It&#39;s a guarantee, a partnership you can later exploit for your own business gains.That&#39;s not pursuit, Alexander; that&#39;s strategy. And it&#39;s pathetic. So no, you&#39;re not like Cedric. In fact, you don&#39;t even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed like a slap, precise and merciless. Caught by the way the sunlight lit up Daniela&#39;s features, Alexander&#39;s gaze lingered, and then, without warning, he let out a low, hollow laugh. &#34;Isn&#39;t that interesting? I&#39;ve been saying all this, and you&#39;ve been calm this whole time. But the second I brought up Cedric, you got worked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her glass of water, taking a sip before setting it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,things have changed, haven&#39;t they?&#34; Alexander probed, his voice low and steady, a stark contrast to the intensity in his gaze as he searched her face for any sign of contradiction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Daniela offered a slight, enigmatic smile. Her response was serene, almost detached. &#34;Wasn&#39;t it clear all along? In terms of looks, Cedric&#39;s sophistication and allure make you look downright ordinary.In terms of talent, his brilliance outshines your own. And when it comes to power, prestige, and wealth-really,in which aspect do you think you could possibly outdo him? You wish to rival Cedric? Please, do tell-what do you possess that might possibly surpass him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint tilt of her head and a sarcastic edge to her tone, she pressed on. &#34;What could I possibly gain from you? Your inconsistency? Your egotism? Or perhaps it&#39;s the deceitful guise you don today, dredging up bygone days as if they hold any relevance? Alexander, save your breath. If you&#39;re searching for someone who can endure your presence, try Joyce. She&#39;s still in the dark about you, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadow of anger swept across Alexander&#39;s face, a tempest lurking just beneath his stoic facade. Each of her scathing words struck deep, challenging his self-control, yet he anchored himself in his seat,determined to reclaim her affection without losing his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension coiled tightly within him as he leaned forward, his voice strained but deliberate.&#34;IfI&#39;m the villain you paint me to be, what drew you to me in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered without hesitation, &#34;I&#39;ve explained this before. But it seems you&#39;ve forgotten, so I&#39;ll remind you. I mistook you for the boy during my darkest days of depression in youth. Does that make things clear enough for you?&#34;	J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Alexander&#39;s face, his eyes searching hers for a sliver of the past warmth. In a voice edged with desperation, he pleaded, &#34;And now? There&#39;s nothing left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing at all,&#34; Daniela shot back with an edge to her voice. &#34;The day I asked for a divorce, I wiped away all memories of what we once were. We should be strangers from now on. The only reason we&#39;re meeting today is that your endless persistence exhausted what little patience I had left. And maybe because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trailed off as she lifted her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who had been talking to his secretary outside appeared, his tall frame backlit by the light flooding in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze drifted, following her pointed look, and his heart clenched painfully as he spotted Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, with his usual aloof and frosty demeanor, strode towards them, his presence as imposing as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when he talked to Daniela, a soft smile played on his lips.′′Are you ready to leave? If so, let&#39;s head upstairs and have lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s delay, Daniela rose andaccompanied Cedric, leaving Alexander to stew in solitude at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched their receding figures, a sense of finality washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that realization struck him with the force of a thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had lost her. Completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric and Daniela were about to vanish from view, Alexander&#39;s emotions boiled over. Leaping to his feet,he bellowed after her,&#34;Daniela! You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
