                <p>Stillness settled over the room for what feltlike ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody uttered a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Ethan, who usually filled any quiet with his chatter,seemed willing to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty showed in their eyes as they glanced at one another,waiting for someone to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,Hamilton looked away first. He weighed his options and realized that, schemes aside, having two healthy grandkids put him in a better place than anyone else in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stiffened for a second, and then his gaze dropped to the floor as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already signed over her shares.If she truly planned to take advantage of him, there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Ethan&#39;s thoughts, leaving him at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had invested more than thirty billion and managed to secure eighteen percent,so Ethan figured his own contribution should earn him something similar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got six billion on hand. What kind of equity could I get for that?&#34; Ethan asked, rushing the words out before Daniela could answer. &#34;And don&#39;t forget,I know Brad mortgaged some of his properties. I have plenty of real estate too. Actually, my villa alone should be worth up to ten billion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, Hamilton reappeared, wearing a look of mild disbelief. &#34;So you&#39;re telling me you&#39;ve been buying up all that property? Why was I left in the dark? Am I running the business just to end up as the poorest one here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan seemed to shrink, glancing at Daniela as he tried to press his case. &#34;Go ahead and rip me off if you want,but can you at least give me ten percent? Brad got credit for his first round. Can you cut me a little slack,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious Ethan was desperate, his tone taking on a pleading note as he tried to strike a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood off to the side, surprised to see Ethan acting this meek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Ethan had asked Hamilton for money in the past, he had done it with arrogance and swagger.Yet now,he was nothing but respectful in front of Daniela. &#34;You&#39;ll get five percent,&#34; said Daniela, her voice sharp and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number nearly knocked Ethan off his feet. &#34;Hold on,are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you already, it&#39;s different now,&#34; Daniela replied,rising from her seat and heading to the dining table.&#34;Joining later means getting less. After dinner, make your choice. If you&#39;re willing, have your lawyer draft the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlucky was the only word Ethan could think of to describe his situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things had definitely taken a turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of having things handled for him, he now faced the task of finding his own lawyer and handling his contract by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela wasted no time and headed for her meal, Ethan lingered, clearly unhappy, before finally signing on the dotted line. Reluctance marked every movement as he handed over his signature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Now tell me, how are you actually planning to get the money from Josh?&#34; Ethan blurted out,impatience dripping from his voice. Billions were at stake, and he could hardly believe how easily it seemed to slip away. &#34;Getting money out of Josh is almost impossible. I&#39;ve tried every trick, and he still turned me down. I&#39;ve signed everything,Daniela,so l hope you really have a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her spoon, Daniela blew lightly on her soup.&#34;Tomorrow at ten, meet me at McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity crept into Ethan&#39;s expression. &#34;What exactly are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to collect what&#39;s owed,&#34; Daniela answered, not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My money,right?&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyelids lifted just enough for him to see her cool gaze. &#34;That&#39;s mine now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words escaped him, and Ethan could only gape in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Hamilton still looked unsettled. His concern showed as he spoke quietly to Daniela. &#34;Josh isn&#39;t easy to deal with. You&#39;re expecting. Maybe I should go in your place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the tall window, Daniela dialed a number. &#34;Hello, Josh? Daniela here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Josh&#39;s laugh rang out. &#34;What&#39;s this about? Are you calling to beg for forgiveness already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chill filled Daniela&#39;s eyes as she replied, &#34;Be at McCoy Group tomorrow at ten.&#34; turned me down. I&#39;ve signed everything,Daniela,sol hope you really have a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her spoon, Daniela blew lightly on her soup.&#34;Tomorrow at ten, meet me at McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity crept into Ethan&#39;s expression. &#34;What exactly are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to collect what&#39;s owed,&#34; Daniela answered,not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My money,right?&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyelids lifted just enough for him to see her cool gaze. &#34;That&#39;s mine now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words escaped him, and Ethan could only gape in silence.</p>

                <p>Chill filled Daniela&#39;s eyes as she replied, &#34;Be at McCoy Group tomorrow at ten.&#34; Josh had barely begun to answer when the line cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it sink in, and Josh muttered angrily to himself, &#34;Unbelievable. Why am I the one being summoned? She should come to see me instead!&#34;</p>
