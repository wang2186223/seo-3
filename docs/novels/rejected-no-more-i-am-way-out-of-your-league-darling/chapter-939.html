                <p>Hamilton blurted out, &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching out, Daniela closed her laptop and stretched for the orange juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass remained just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, never one to show much warmth, slid the glass toward her with slow precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; said Daniela, taking a careful sip.&#34;Anything that threatens our family or my safety isn&#39;t my responsibility,but Cedric&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For example, Cedric had dismissed all the household staff without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were other times, like when Cedric sent Nikolas and Damon away and brought in the Lone Wolf to guard the villa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handled those decisions, not her. A flicker of surprise crossed Hamilton&#39;s eyes. &#34;I&#39;m family, not an outsider, so l have to be here. You&#39;re carrying my grandchild, and I know my siblings play rough. I want to make sure nothing happens to you.I&#39;d never put you in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze. &#34;Is that really true? You&#39;ve tried to hurt me before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable look settled on Hamilton&#39;s face.&#34;That was then. Let&#39;s put it behind us. Just tell Cedric I want this. If you help me now, I promise I&#39;ll never stand in your way again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt that he&#39;d compromised enough. A smart woman would agree, then go talk Cedric into letting him visit without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela replied, &#34;Absolutely not. Cedric&#39;s happiness comes first. I won&#39;t upset him for anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton could only stare at the pair in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He once believed Cedric was the only hopeless romantic, but now it seemed Daniela had caught the same bug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You only need to ask, and he&#39;d agree. That&#39;s not a big ask for you,&#34; he insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Daniela agreed. &#34;Maybe, but l respect what he&#39;s in charge of. If you want to come,take it up with him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped Hamilton as he pressed his lips together. &#34;If I could persuade him, would I be here pleading with you?&#34; Truthfully, he came to her because she seemed easier to reason with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she did was lift her shoulders, silently saying there was nothing she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slowly got to his feet, clearly accepting defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he moved to leave, Daniela noticed him glance at the trash can, then her belly, his thoughts clearly wrestling inside him. His hands curled into fists, then released, over and over, as if weighing what he could never quite say. Hamilton&#39;s frustration could no longer be contained,so he set off to confront Cedsic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting her chin on her palm, Daniela watched as Hamilton marched over to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversations between the two began with civility shifted into strained patience, and ended with Hamilton&#39;s temper flaring. Cedric kept his composure the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the villa&#39;s impressive soundproofing,Hamilton&#39;s voice pierced through the glass. &#34;I am your father! I deserve to see my grandchild.Forget all your rules and reasons-they mean nothing to me!I&#39;m coming here, and you can expect me every single day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Hamilton seethed, Cedric responded without a hint ofemotion,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the conversation ended, Hamilton thundered out and gave the door a good slam. &#34;Whether you allow it or not, I&#39;ll come back with a crowd and push past y/our guards if I must. You better believe I mean it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dramatic exit was what he intended. After spotting Daniela lounging on the sofa, he finally stomped away, hands planted on his hips, still burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Propping up her chin again, Daniela silently observed the chaos, then turned her focus elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Hamilton returned-not empty-handed, but with a truck piled high with health supplements. Daniela noticed him among the blooming garden beds, inspecting the new plantings.She narrowed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, taking in the heady scent of jasmine,wrinkled his nose. &#34;What is all this? The scent is overpowering.Are you trying to poison my grandson with these flowers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the head gardener stepped forward. &#34;No, Mr. McCoy. Jasmine is good for expectant mothers. It&#39;s calming, which is why we filled the garden with it.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s frown faded as he listened. He gestured toward empty patches in the garden. &#34;If these help pregnant women, then fill those empty spots as wvell.There. And over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for his checkbook, Hamilton handed over a generous sum. &#34;No cutting corners. I want jasmine everywhere. Make sure it&#39;s done right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed outside, braving the blazing heat, and supervised as the gardeners worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched as Hamilton soon found himself in a floral jungle, surrounded by gardeners with masks covering their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms crossed, Carol leaned in toward Daniela. &#34;Isn&#39;t this a bit much for him? Those gardeners are wearing enough masks for a chemical spill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply replied, &#34;We don&#39;t want to alarm Hamilton just yet. Those plants need to stay in the garden for a few more days. Just let him inside. If he gets poisoned and dies outside the villa, it&#39;ll be quite the spectacle,&#34;</p>
