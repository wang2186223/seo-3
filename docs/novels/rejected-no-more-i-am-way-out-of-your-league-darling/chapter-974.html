            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Carol turned her head toward Daniela, admiration glowing in her eyes. Daniela had seen the situation clearer than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s tips quivered. Panic clung to her like a second skin. &#34;If Josh really hurts Mason, what do you expect me to do? Mason means everything to me.He&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. If anything happens to him, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll keep living.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria used to be the Thomas family&#39;s pride. A well -loved daughter with charm, elegance, and a spark that lit every room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But marriage to Josh had clipped her wings. Life as his wife turned into a golden prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,fear had taken hold. She looked like she might fall to her knees at Daniela&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped over and gently helped her up. &#34;You&#39;re spiraling. Josh wouldn&#39;t touch Mason. That boy is his blood too. Why would he hurt his own son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stared at her, clinging to the flicker of hope in her chest. She looked toward Daniela,waiting-maybe  even begging-for a lifeline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed still, calm as ever. &#34;Victoria, I warned you when we first spoke. You said you&#39;d pay any price to divorce Josh,didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, eyes full of regret. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean Mason would be part of the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head. &#34;Getting what you want always costs something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria blinked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held her smile, but her voice sharpened.&#34;I can step in now. But Mason isn&#39;t a piece on a chessboard.If I do this again, what happens the next time? Josh will always be his father. If Mason can&#39;t figure out how to handle that, he&#39;ll always be your vulnerability. This is your turning point, Victoria. I can&#39;t walk the path for you. And I won&#39;t be here forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up as Victoria begged, &#34;Daniela, please.Just one last time. I&#39;ll even give you better terms on the shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet sigh. &#34;Keep your shares. I&#39;ll help you again. But this is the last.&#34; She placed her hand gently on her belly. Her expression softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy lit up Victoria&#39;s face. She nearly jumped with relief.&#34;Thank you, Daniela. Thank you so much.&#34; Before Victoria walked out,Daniela gave her one final instruction. She was not to contact Mason until he&#39;d been brought back safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded quickly, too overjoyed to form words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got back to the villa Daniela had prepared she couldn&#39;t help herself. She messaged Mason anyway. &#34;Sweetheart, someone&#39;s coming to pick you up soon.Hang tight,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason read it and passed the phone to Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes went cold as he typed back, &#34;Mom,I miss you so much. Please come get me. Hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Daniela&#39;s team quietly retrieved Mason from where he was staying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They brought him to the villa she had prepared.After the others left, Mason turned to the people standing by the door. &#34;&#39;I want a moment alone with my mother.Please give us some space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, they moved back toward the main entrance of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, the curtains hung half-closed, letting in slivers of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile broke through as soon as she saw him.&#34;Thank goodness you&#39;re safe, sweetheart.&#34; Mason didn&#39;t return the warmth. His expression was stiff, his voice colder than the room. &#34;Mom, what happened to you? Why are you trying to leave Dad?Do you even realize you&#39;re siding with strangers instead of us? So what if Dad has a few kids outside the marriage? He already said I&#39;ll inherit all his assets.You&#39;ve had a good life thanks to him. Isn&#39;t that enough? Men like him always have affairs. That&#39;s how it is in powerful families. You&#39;re the only one making this a big deal. You&#39;re being naive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s voice wavered, but she jumped in to explain,&#34;No, sweetheart, that&#39;s not what this is. He lied to me.I used to be proud of who I was. I was the Thomas family&#39;s cherished daughter. People admired me. He swore I was the only one he&#39;d ever love. After we married, he told me to quit dancing and stay home.He promised he&#39;d take care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked straight at him, holding back tears. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask to live like this. I gave up my independence because | trusted him. Mason, he has six children outside our family. How can you expect me to look past that? Don&#39;t you see why this hurts me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason, with a blank look that matched his father&#39;s,stared her down. &#34;What if there are six? They&#39;re girls,aren&#39;t they? He already said I&#39;d get everything, as long as you don&#39;t divorce him. So what more do you want from him? Just come home. Do it for me, if nothing else.&#34; His eyes locked on hers. The weight behind them was heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head. Tears slipped down her cheeks. &#34;No, Mason. I can&#39;t go back. I can&#39;t live with someone who&#39;s broken me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s grip on her arm tightened, his stare turning cold. &#34;Can&#39;t you just do it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly shook her head again, her face crumpling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason let go. He straightened up and shoved his hand into his pocket.</p>
