                <p>Carol found the whole scene wildly entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her arms across her chest, lingering for a moment before finally stepping inside. Turning to Daniela, she said, &#34;The leaves were flying all over the place. Even the gardener wouldn&#39;t go near Cedric.Everyone just stood there, rooted to the spot, staring at him like he was some terrifying force of nature. Ha -ha! This is hilarious. I&#39;ve never seen Cedric act so crazy before. Daniela, what now? Should I still arrange the plane? The weather report says it&#39;ll be calm this afternoon, so it&#39;s safe for him to fly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela clenched her jaw in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure that even if she forced Cedric to leave,he&#39;d find a way to come back on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy could literally fly a plane by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just wait and see,&#34; Daniela said, her voice sharp with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol chuckled. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t at least one of you be happy? Why do you both look so frustrated? You&#39;re not the type to back down once you&#39;ve decided something.&#34; What&#39;s with you today? Cedric&#39;s pretty impressive. I definitely underestimated him.&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t even spare Carol&#39;s smug grin a glance.She simply closed her eyes and let out a heavy sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric might have looked stubborn on the outside,but deep down, he was clearly nervous-terrified that Daniela might still find a way to send him away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol noticed his unease and burst out laughing &#34;Weren&#39;t you acting all fearless a second ago? I&#39;ve never seen anyone bold enough to threaten Daniela.You&#39;ve got serious guts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrank back a little. &#34;Was I too harsh earlier?Did I yell too loud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harsh?&#34; Carol nodded seriously. &#34;Oh yeah, you were super harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face fell with regret. &#34;Do you think I actually scared her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked in surprise. &#34;Scared her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legendary queen of mercenaries herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would actually be scared by a few harsh words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But But Carol wasn&#39;t about to spell it out for him. She just smirked and said, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Feeling a little scared now? Relax. It&#39;s nothing serious. Daniela said she won&#39;t send you back. Go inside, say a few sweet things to her, and everything will be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes immediately lit up. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded confidently. &#34;Yep. She didn&#39;t ask me to arrange the plane anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric instantly perked up, grabbing his tools and trimming the branches and leaves in front of him with renewed energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he set his tools aside and headed indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found Daniela perched on the sofa, focused on her laptop, typing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly made a fresh glass of juice and brought it over. Daniela looked up, her gaze sharp and unbending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together, then adopted a firm tone. &#34;Here, have some juice. But I meant what I said earlier. If you send me away, I&#39;ll head straight for Hamilton. He&#39;s been grumbling about how useless his sons are and is desperate for a successor. I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s already set on choosing me. If you let me stay, I&#39;ll stick to your rules. But if you force me to leave, I&#39;ll stay in Oiscoll and run things my own way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who had just managed to calm down,felt a fresh wave of anger rising</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, are you seriously threatening me?&#34; she said through gritted teeth</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, copying Daniela&#39;s usual unbothered style,replied coolly, &#34;Of course I am. I&#39;m absolutely threatening you. You&#39;re worried I&#39;ll get hurt, right?Then keep me close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes in pure exasperation. No matter what she said, this man just wouldn&#39;t listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a sigh, momentarily out of solutions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Do whatever you want,&#34; she muttered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric beamed. &#34;Perfect! Now drink your juice. You&#39;re way too stressed. I&#39;ll even cook you dinner later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela opened her mouth to respond, her phone buzzed. It was Hamilton calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Daniela? It&#39;s me, Hamilton. I&#39;d like to invite you and Cedric to dinner Would that be alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if remembering something, Hamilton chuckled and added, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. This tíme, it&#39;ll be just us.&#34;</p>
