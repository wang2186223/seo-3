                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face hardened as a chill settled in his voice. &#34;Daniela, like I said before, the past is finished.It doesn&#39;t matter anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short, hollow laugh slipped from Daniela, all the warmth stripped from her voice. &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter? The ones who cause pain are always so quick to declare the slate clean. But I&#39;m the one left carrying the scars.When those responsible end up suffering for once, maybe you&#39;ll want to say those words for them,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze at her words. &#34;What are you plotting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A measured calm settled over Daniela as she propped her chin on one hand, her eyes turning distant.&#34;I let them lose everything they cling to. Maybe then, they&#39;ll get a taste of what they put me through. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s only fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was light, almost offhand, but a warning simmered beneath the surface, sending an unmistakable chill through Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning to do?&#34; he asked, his voice edged with caution as his eyes stayed fixed on Daniela.Something about her in that moment pulled back the veil, and thouggh he couldn&#39;t explain why, he suddenly remembered exactly who she was-Clarinda, the name spoken in fear, the woman who could kill without a trace and disappear without a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Daniela&#39;s knowing smile returned. &#34;Relax. Murder&#39;s never really been my style. And grudges this big? Letting them off easy with death wouldn&#39;t be nearly as satisfying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Hamilton&#39;s spine at her words. &#34;What exactly are you planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face stayed unreadable, her voice cool and detached. &#34;I know what they did back then. Out of consideration for the fact that you&#39;re Cedric&#39;s fater by blood, I&#39;m offering you the chance to walk away from McCoy Group on your own terms. I&#39;m coming after McCoy Group, and I won&#39;t be subtle about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scowl formed on Hamilton&#39;s face. &#34;Have you lost your mind? You actually intend to go up against McCoy Group? This is Oiscoll, after all. Don&#39;t kid yourself-if you try anything here, you&#39;ll be lucky to leave in one piece!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was a laugh, sharper and more scornful than ever.&#34;Is that so? I guess we&#39;ll find out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, she prepared to go. Before crossing the threshold, Daniela tossed a final warning back at him. &#34;A billion might feel like pocket change to you now, but you&#39;d better cherish it while you still can.Soon,you won&#39;t even be able to scrape together that amount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burned through Hamilton. Daniela wasn&#39;t justout of line-she was downright unhinged. Never in his entire career had anyone spoken to him with such disregard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all his bluster, a chill of anxiety worked its way under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no way of knowing for certain what Daniela might do, and there was no way to predict just how far she&#39;d go. But with her now standing as the wealthiest individual on the planet, any strike she aimed at McCoy Group was bound to leave damage they couldn&#39;t shrug off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts turned chaotic, panic creeping in as he weighed his next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considered calling an emergency shareholders&#39; meeting right then and there, but the thought of eyes watching his every move kept him frozen. So instead, he reached out to the board through a discreet message, warning them of the threat Daniela now posed to McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mockery greeted him from every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Hamilton? You expect us to buy that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, is it April Fools&#39; already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must be, if you&#39;re this jumpy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, scared of Daniela? Hamilton, you&#39;re becoming a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not forget-Daniela wouldn&#39;t be sitting on her fortune if not for Cedric&#39;s genius. Hamilton, maybe you ought to retire and hand the reins to him-he&#39;s clearly more competent than you ever were.&#34; &#34;Bring Daniela on! I&#39;d like to see her try. I&#39;ll wipe the floor with her myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resignation washed over Hamilton, leaving him with little to say in his own defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a nagging tension gnawed at him from the inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What moves would Daniela make next? How much destruction was she willing to risk? McCoy Group was a colossus; any serious attack would mean disaster for everyone involved. Would she truly go that far?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t seem anywhere close to probable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had long since passed, and this world didn&#39;t allow for endless loyalty-only endless self-interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wouldn&#39;t sacrifice her company&#39;s interests for a vendetta. The board wouldn&#39;t also allowv it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that reasoning, Hamilton&#39;s worry eased a little, letting him breathe easier for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as dawn broke the next day, McCoy Group&#39;s stock price began to flicker and dance in ways that caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vigilant as ever, Hamilton was the first to spot the odd movement. His questions flew straight to the market department, yet complacency ruled there; years of easy victories had dulled their instincts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t offer much beyond a standard reply. &#34;Mr. McCoy, this sort of fluctuation happens all the time.There&#39;s nothing unusual about it. Our mining foundation is solid, and overseas shifts now and then tend to shake up the numbers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to be ignored, Hamilton fired off a warning to the board, insisting they look into the shifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Complacency, however, had set in deep over the years, blinding the board to any sign of danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their reaction was to ignore Hamilton altogether, brushing off his concerns with practiced indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind closed doors, they ridiculed Hamilton, claiming age had dulled his edge. He never used to flinch like this-not when he was younger,not when he still had fire in him. Now that the years had caught up, he was losing his nerve over a woman.</p>
