                <p>Kohen felt like he was on the brink of losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was completely out of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already insane that she&#39;d asked him to kill Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she was going through with it,the least they could do was talk about it in private. Who just threw that out in the open like it was nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talk like Charles would actually go through with it,&#34; Kohen muttered under his breath, unable to hide his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her eyes slowly, her gaze locking onto Charles&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a single glance in her direction, Charles stepped forward. His hand reached for the knife on the table, then he turned and walked to Nikolas. Nikolas&#39; eyes widened in disbelief as he shouted,&#34;Charles, have you lost your mind? I&#39;m your brother!You&#39;re seriously submitting to a woman just for the sake of the family fortune? What happened to your pride, honor, and loyalty to your own family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas backed away with every step, while Charles steadily kept moving forward with unwavering resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife in his hand glinted under the light, and his eyes were emotionless as he stared at Nikolas like he was already a corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, it&#39;s winner takes all. I don&#39;t have a choice,so don&#39;t hold it against me. I&#39;m a man, and I refuse to spend my life being controlled by someone else.I spent my whole life under Dad&#39;s control. If I can&#39;t reclaim my freedom after he&#39;s gone, then everything I&#39;ve lived for will have been meaningless. Today is the perfect opportunity, and I&#39;m being honest about it.I&#39;m determined to fight for this inheritance. If you want to compete with me, it&#39;ll only lead to a bitter and destructive clash between us. But if you step back now, you&#39;ll still be my brother.&#34;  Nikolas retreated to the door, his brow furrowed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deeply. &#34;What nonsense are you talking about? I&#39;m the eldest son. The position of family head should rightfully be mine. Besides, Daniela is dangerous and unreliable. If you let her manipulate you, this family will fall into her hands. Wake up, Charles. Put the knife down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles shook his head. &#34;Nothing in this world is handed to anyone. Everything must be fought for. If you refuse to step down, then I must apologize in advance for what&#39;s coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, Charles raised the knife. The knife cut through the air with a sharp arc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes widened in horror. In that instant, he saw the raw ambition burning in Charles&#39; eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was shocked to discover that his brother had harbored a burning desire to fight for the family fortune, and he hadn&#39;t even seen it coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife descended. Nikolas and Charles locked into a fierce grapple, while Kohen stood there,completely dumbfounded. He hadn&#39;t imagined Charles would be this resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his fists, he turned to Daniela, his blood pulsing with adrenaline. &#34;Do I still have a chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the world had gone utterly mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was pinned to the floor, helpless as his two brothers stabbed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Daniela not stepped in at the last moment,reminding them to keep the violence out of her office,Nikolas feared he might have actually died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sirens wailed as the ambulance arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lay on the floor, bleeding, staring at his two brothers, their faces splattered with his blood,yet their eyes remained cold and indifferent, not even sparing him a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing his eyes, Nikolas realized the war for the family fortune had officially begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Carol wiped the blood off the pristine office floor, Daniela&#39;s phone rang. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going too far?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s cold voice cut through. &#34;No matter what happens, you can&#39;t harm my sons. I heard Nikolas lost a lot of blood. Daniela,you&#39;ve gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile. Standing through the window in her office, she gazed down at the bustling street below, where people hurried by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied to Hamilton coldly, &#34;Consider this my gift to you, and I&#39;ll only say it once. Stay away from Cedric. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m unaware of the private jet you&#39;ve arranged to sneak him out early. If I leave and find out Cedric&#39;s already gone, I swear your three sons won&#39;t live to see another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was light, but the menace behind her words was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added lightly, &#34;You have five sons, Hamilton. If they all die, do you think the family fortune will end up in Cedric&#39;s hands?&#34;</p>
