                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze lingered on the photo, studying it intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the image, Daniela&#39;s head was slightly turned, a fleeting softness flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad.&#34; He spoke with quiet satisfaction. &#34;Why bring up the family photo? You know Brylee is the one she cherishes most. It had to be something you saidthat unsettled her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face fell with regret. &#34;How was I supposed to know? It&#39;s been years! She was just five back then.What could she possibly remember? Why is she still holding on to it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander slipped his phone back into his pocket with care. &#34;That&#39;s because, growing up,Daniela had no one shielding her-except for Brylee. That&#39;s why the memory of her mother runs so deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was quick to respond. &#34;That works in our favor.Since she&#39;s lost her past memories, we should show her kindness. You know how it is-when someone&#39;s been deprived of care, even the smallest warmth feels like a debt to repay. Elite Lux isn&#39;t what it used to be, but Daniela is sharp and knows how to make money. Marrying her would be a win. I brought  up her divorcing Cedric, and she didn&#39;t object.Alexander, go all in this time. Make sure you don&#39;t lose her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a firm nod. &#34;This time, I won&#39;t let her slip away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was genuinely baffled. He had been sure he was closing the distance between them, yet the next day,Daniela refused to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol, are you sure there&#39;s no mistake?&#34; Alexander was stuck on the first floor, denied access upstairs. His voice was laced with frustration. &#34;We just had dinner together yesterday. Daniela wasn&#39;t upset at all. She even went along with taking a family photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol folded her arms, arching a brow. &#34;Oh? Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded with conviction. &#34;Absolutely! The mood was great, completely peaceful. Daniela even brought up divorcing Cedric and marrying me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shrugged, palms up. &#34;Let&#39;s see the photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander pulled up the photo on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol snatched the phone, deleted the photo in a flash, and emptied the recycle bin for good measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in a single, seamless motion. Alexander froze, staring at her, his brain struggling to catch up with what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol raised an eyebrow. &#34;Got any more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling, Alexander shook his head numbly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a curt nod. &#34;Good. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to leave, but Alexander stepped in her way,confusion written all over his face. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s tone was flat. &#34;Daniela is busy and doesn&#39;t have time for pointless social calls. They ruin her appetite. She&#39;d prefer if you didn&#39;t come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander blinked, caught off guard.&#34;Why? We had a great talk yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you?&#34; Carol shot him a look of pure disdain.Alexander had the unmistakable air of a man who basked in his own wealth, parading it for all to see.&#34;Maybe that&#39;s how you saw it, but we didn&#39;t. No reason to stay in touch. End of story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Carol turned on her heel and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,I honestly don&#39;t get what you ever saw in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed the report in her hands, clearly unbothered. &#34;He hasn&#39;t come back. has he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shook her head. &#34;Nope. He looked pretty shaken Doubt he&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous show&#39;s massive success had breathed new life into Elite Lux. Business was booming,keeping Daniela buried in work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she knew it, a month had slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One evening, an auction was taking place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t keen on attending, but Carol insisted on dragging her along, claiming she needed a change of pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled to a stop at the auction venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before stepping out, they spotted Cedric and Alexander near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander strutted around like he owned the place,radiating arrogance, his voice never pausing as he spoke with a self-satisfied smirk. His finger repeatedly jabbed in Cedric&#39;s direction, emphasizing his injured leg</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spoke so loudly that even through the slightly open window, Carol could catch every word.&#34;Cedric, this was your doing, wasn&#39;t it? Everything was settled that day-Daniela agreed to leave you and marry me. But then, suddenly, she changed her mind.What did you say to her? A grown man like you,resorting to these desperate theatrics. Don&#39;t you find that embarrassing? Cedric, do you even understand what love really means? It&#39;s about letting go, about making the person you love happy. But you? You&#39;re just being selfish. That injured leg of yours? It&#39;s karma.Someone like you has no right to be loved by Daniela.With that leg of yours, you shouldn&#39;t even be showing yourself in public. Do you have any idea what people are saying? They&#39;re wondering how someone like Daniela-a globally respected executive-could possibly have a husband who looks like this. Have you even considered how humiliating it must be for her to be the subject of such gossip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander carried himself with an air of arrogance,drawing curious glances from those nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to Daniela. &#34;Want me to step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze flickered to Cedric&#39;s silent figure. Her voice was steady. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol hesitated, noting the distinct chill in Daniela&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slid into a spot in the underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela entered, Alexander, seated in the front row,waved eagerly, practically beaming. He shouted. &#34;Daniela! Over here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His booming voice drew glances from all directions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding the whole scene tiresome, Daniela chose a seat in the back without much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time, Alexander made his way over from the front row. &#34;Daniela, there you are. I knew showing up at these events would eventually lead me to you.There&#39;s a prime spot up front with a great view. Come sit with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was ice. &#34;No, thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s grin stiffened, the confidence in his expression faltering. Dropping his voice, he leaned in slightly and said, &#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t know what went wrong last time. If something&#39;s bothering you,don&#39;t just bottle it up. Just tell me,and I&#39;ll fix it.&#34;</p>
