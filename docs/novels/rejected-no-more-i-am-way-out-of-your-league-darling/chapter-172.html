                <p>Katrina mustered a smile that was far from genuine. &#34;Daniela, you really should have a word with your people.Look at Marilyn-she&#39;s my aunt. If word gets out, it might tarnish the Harper family&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained focused on the television. &#34;Katrina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps you&#39;re misunderstanding something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; Katrina asked, her confusion evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marilyn is aservant in this family. If you can&#39;t grasp such a simple fact, how can you possibly be fit to oversee anything in this household?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened, her face freezing as her words failed her.&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve really changed. You&#39;ve become quite cutting with your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Daniela answered, her smile calm and unwavering.&#34;It&#39;s a pity I didn&#39;t figure it out sooner.I used to believe that maintaining family harmony was paramount. But actually, I don&#39;t even have a family anymore. I tolerated all the bullshit for years, and it was all for nothing. Reflecting on my former self, I can only laugh at how naive I was. But that&#39;s behind me now. Now, l&#39;ve realized the most important thing in life is to seek my own happiness. And for that lesson, I have you to thank you. After years of observing you, l&#39;ve finally caught on. Honestly, I&#39;m embarrassed it took me so long to learn from such a perfect example.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian, standing a short distance away, couldn&#39;t suppress their laughter any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spun around to face them, her brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;What&#39;s so funny? I&#39;m merely stating the obvious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter grew louder, almost contagious. &#34;Absolutely, you couldn&#39;t be more right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina looked at Daniela&#39;s people. The tension made her hesitant to speak further, fearing any misstep might have her ending up on the floor like Marilyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the wail of an ambulance cut through the chatter, and soon, paramedics were escorting Marilyn out on a stretcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce caught sight of Marilyn&#39;s severely swollen face and gasped in horror. For the first time,genuine fear of Daniela crept into Joyce&#39;s heart. Daniela&#39;s behavior was wildly unpredictable-bordering on madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes darted from the kitchen to Daniela. She asked, &#34;Dad, surely Daniela isn&#39;t thinking of staying here for good, is she? You promised-every asset of the Harper family was meant for Jack! What is she doing here? Is she challenging Jack for the inheritance now? How could Daniela act so shamelessly? Trying to claim what you vowed to give the child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina added, &#34;It&#39;s unbelievable how Daniela has worsened over the years. After relinquishing everything and walking away, why return now to snatch it away? She&#39;s well aware that you dedicated it all to Joyce. And not just the company-now she&#39;s eyeing the house too? Isn&#39;t that going a bit too far? Despite her wealth,she seems indifferent to our modest assets. It&#39;s as if she&#39;s driven purely by the desire to spite us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face clouded over, his gaze turning icy with displeasure. Daniela&#39;s antics were a constant thorn in his side! He was baffled by her motivations. What compelled her to disrupt their tranquility so persistently?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life could&#39;ve been simple, but no, she just had to screw it all up like a goddamn tornado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina cast a wary glance to the living room, now bustling with the noise of Daniela&#39;s people reorganizing the area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each change, it seemed their family&#39;s living space dwindled even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together in frustration, Katrina turned to face Caiden. &#34;Honey, it&#39;s clear Daniela isn&#39;t taking our concerns to heart. Maybe you could have a word with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>d Caiden responded with a harsh, cynical chuckle, &#34;Do you honestly believe she&#39;ll pay any heed to what I have to say? Just look at her, parading around as if she owns the place. If I confront her, she&#39;s likely to rip into me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Caiden harbored a deep-seated guilt over his previous dealings with Daniela, which now deterred him from facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s aura was one of formidable resolve, a stark contrast to anyone who dared challenge her-a trait that deeply unnerved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Brylee was around, she kept Caiden under her wing, protecting him from the world. He was nothing more than a coward who preyed on the weak and cowered before the strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daniela looked like a pushover, the perfect victim who wouldn&#39;t dare fight back. He had taken full advantage of that, treating her like shit. But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela put on a display of bravado, Caiden visibly recoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden!&#34; Katrina exclaimed, her voice tinged with exasperation. &#34;This isn&#39;t just about me or Joyce anymore.We&#39;re talking about securing our family&#39;s future! What about Jack? Are you really willing to just leave him in the lurch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, Caiden dismissed her concerns with a wave of his hand. &#34;The company shares are intact.The portion Brylee left me-Daniela can&#39;t lay a finger on that. As long as she&#39;s at the helm, Jack will continue to receive his cut of the profits. Just look at Daniela-she looks like she&#39;s ready to tear someone apart. Do you honestly believe confronting her will help? It&#39;ll only backfire on us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela was Brylee&#39;s own flesh and blood, endowed with the same formidable acumen. How could Caiden not feel intimidated?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was far from appeased. She stared at Caiden with a mix of disappointment and frustration. &#34;You need to have a word with her. Don&#39;t make it a confrontation. Just keep it calm. Talk to her the same way you did when you negotiated for the company shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emphasis on &#34;talk to her&#34; hung heavily in the air, brimming with hidden pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden swiveled to face Katrina, a skeptical frown creasing his brow.&#34;You want me to act all pitiful again?What if she sees right through it this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Daniela had first grappled with the loss of her mother, she had clung to him, utterly vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, years had trickled by since then, and the bond they once shared had frayed, delicate as tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could he possibly reap from dredging up old tactics?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give it a shot! How will you know unless you try? You&#39;re still her father. If you approach her with sincere tears and express your remorse, surely she can&#39;t disregard you entirely,&#34; Katrina coaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes dropped, weighed down by resignation. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll give it a go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, what did he have to lose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Persuading Daniela to go could just be the key to bringing back the quiet harmony they once had.</p>
