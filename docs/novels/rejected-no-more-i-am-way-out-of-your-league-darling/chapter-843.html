                <p>The moment Kohen stepped into the villa, Cedric leaned in close to Daniela and whispered, &#34;Looks like the real undercover agent has finally shown up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled mockingly as she turned to Josie and said, &#34;You&#39;d better start paying closer attention to what&#39;s being served.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s gaze drifted to Kohen, who had just entered and gave a subtle nod of understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon trailed in behind lazily, dragging his feet and avoiding Daniela&#39;s eyes. &#34;I already ate. I&#39;m just gonna head to my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already full? Really?&#34; Kohen chuckled. &#34;Weren&#39;t you the one saying you were starving on the way here?Daniela, I got kicked out too. How about taking me in as well? I won&#39;t ask for much; just a simple room will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing,sat, and began to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t say a word either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen grinned. &#34;No reply? I assume that&#39;s a yes, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the table, Carol said to Damon, &#34;What happened? You look like someone beat you bloody. Did you get chewed out at home? Come on, let eat together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stared at the plate, his head down, poking at his food without appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Daniela asked, &#34;What are you looking at? Eat. Or is barbecue not to your taste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shook his head, a sudden lump rising in his throat. For a moment, he felt like he might cry. His idol,Daniela, was so kind, yet it was possible his own family had been responsible for her child&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela ever found out, would she turn on him,too? Guilt ate away at Damon, tormenting him without end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped his fork and rushed out of the dining room to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze momentarily, caught off guard by Damon&#39;s sudden surge of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen chuckled. &#34;Ignore him. He just got scolded by our dad back home. His pride&#39;s a little bruised, that&#39;s all. He&#39;ll bounce back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile and said,11SO1, your pride hasn&#39;t been bruised, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen paused momentarily, unsure if it was just his imagination, but he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Daniela was never quite as forgiving with him as she was with Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Kohen tracked down Damon.′′Are you trying to announce to everyone that we&#39;re undercover for the McCoy family? What was that stunt at dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s irritation was evident.&#34;Oh,look at you, so capable. How about you stop lecturing me and worry about your own business? You&#39;re just hereto confirm Daniela&#39;s fear of heights, aren&#39;t you? Honestly,you disgust me. You&#39;re great at talking big over dinner, but when it comes to business, you can&#39;t beat her, so you fall back on sneaky tactics.It&#39;s pathetic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen frowned. &#34;Who are you calling pathetic? Haven&#39;t you ever spent the McCoy family&#39;s money? That cash came from blood, sweat, and broken backs. If you&#39;re so noble, why don&#39;t you try living without it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; Damon snapped. &#34;I won&#39;t take another cent from the McCoy family from now on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen nodded. &#34;That&#39;s a bold stance. Let&#39;s see how long you can keep it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, the family&#39;s biggest spender, was claiming he&#39;d stop using the family&#39;s money? That was downright ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stormed back to his room, seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Carol sprawled across the sofa and said to Daniela, &#34;He seems really upset. He&#39;s no match for Kohen. Aren&#39;t you going to do something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;He needs to figure it out himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be like that,&#34; Carol said with a pout. &#34;Go knock on his door and tell him to come out and play video games with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Daniela stood, padded over, and knocked on Damon&#39;s door. &#34;Hey, Damon, wanna come out and play a game with Carol?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon truly believed that Daniela was a good person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wasn&#39;t, then why would she have gone out of her way to fund Nikolas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wouldn&#39;t it have been easier to turn her back on Nikolas when he was down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she have taken them in if she weren&#39;t a good person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the McCoy family, someone showing up with a weak excuse like &#34;I got kicked out&#34; would be laughed out the door or thrown out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela had welcomed him in, offering a sense of familial warmth he&#39;d never experienced. And he cherished it deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Damon said quietly, opening the door just a crack. &#34;I made a deal with Cedric. No matter where you two end up, there will always be a place for me in your home. Are you okay with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded.&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon looked at her, surprised. &#34;Aren&#39;t you gonna ask what I used to blackmail Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed completely unfazed. &#34;Don&#39;t care. So, are we playing or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calmness gave Damon an unexpected sense of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; He followed Daniela as she headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol waved enthusiastically. &#34;Come on! Don&#39;t be so upset. Let&#39;s get a round in!&#34; Damon dropped onto the couch beside them, picking up a controller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, back in his room, Damon called Nikolas and told him about what Kohen had said to him earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, if it ever comes to that and Daniela turns against the McCoy family, what will you do? Will you go after her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched on the other end of the line. Then finally, Nikolas repolied,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon sniffled and said,-.&#34;i won&#39;t either.&#34;</p>
                
                
            </div>
