                <p>Kohen rushed back to Oiscoll and began searching for the person who matched the handwriting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But three days had come and gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handwriting he once knew so well had vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela broke into McCoy Group&#39;s system and ran comparisons across every handwriting sample available, but nothing came up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a single lead to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen returned, drained and breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told Daniela, &#34;Someone&#39;s trying to block my investigation. I searched through the electronic signatures, even checked the archives, but it&#39;s like everything&#39;s been wiped. Some files are missing. Someone is making sure I don&#39;t find the person who wrote that note. There&#39;s something deeper going on here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already figured that out during her system breach. She didn&#39;t react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood beside her and spoke evenly. &#34;lf nothing turns up, I&#39;ll join McCoy Group myself.Anything that once existed leaves a trail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen was mad. &#34;What are you saying? Are you planning to reconnect with the McCoy family just because of this mysterious handwriting? And you want to join McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Why not? Didn&#39;t you say Hamilton feels bad for everything that happened to me? He should be willing to make up for it, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen froze. He didn&#39;t know if Hamilton would agree.What he did know was that his father had missed Cedric&#39;s mother all these years. Every conflict between his parents had started because of Cedric&#39;s mother. Given his father&#39;s love for Cedric&#39;s mother, Kohen was sure his father would show favoritism towards Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen pressed his lips together and stared at Cedric,then at Daniela. Their faces gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted to something Nikolas once said -there was more than one way to get rid of someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accidents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lllness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the ache that came with losing a loved one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he explored every option, he&#39;d find a solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The panic on Kohen&#39;s face slowly faded, replaced by something colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you should think twice before going down this road. You can&#39;t join McCoy Group like it&#39;s yours for the taking. That fortune isn&#39;t something you can claim just because you want to. Frankly, I don&#39;t believe this hadwriting is real. You probably forged it. You&#39;re using it as a way into McCoy Group, all so you can compete for the inheritance. Look, if you want some compensation, we&#39;ll give you. But if you&#39;re aiming for a share of the estate, forget it.That&#39;s never going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed composed. &#34;Whether it&#39;s doable or not doesn&#39;t really depend on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen couldn&#39;t even fake a smile anymore.He stared at Cedric and said coldly, &#34;So you&#39;re ready to go against us now? All over a note we haven&#39;t even confirmed? Is that really worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, it was obvious-Cedric was doing this for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t waste another word. His tone turned ice-cold. &#34;Use every connection you have to track down that handwriting. Otherwise, leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he walked away.  Kohen clenched his jaw and muttered, &#34;Damn it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, Cedric found Daniela sitting in front of her computer in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she&#39;d been at it for three days. Quietly, he stepped over and shut the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no point. Everything on the inside has already been wiped clean. It&#39;s not something you can recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had nothing to do with skil. That was just how the system had been built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew that. But she still wanted to give it a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can dig further if I join McCoy Group.Handwriting is like muscle memory-it can be hidden, but never erased forever.&#34; Cedric tried to reassure her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she shook her head. &#34;This is my responsibility.What I said to Kohen earlier was just to push him int o actually looking for the truth.&#34; She understood how dangerous inheritance battles could be in families like theirs. And she didn&#39;t think Cedric should risk himself just for money.</p>
