                <p>Alexander came to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Daniela had shut him down without hesitation, leaving no space for negotiation, he still radiated unwavering confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a tailored black suit, his features mirrored Cedric&#39;s, yet his presence carried an air of undeniable arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here, Cedric?&#34; Alexander sneered.&#34;If I were you, l&#39;d be at home, focusing on recovery-far away from Daniela. We&#39;re back in our country now You wouldn&#39;t want people whispering about her being married to a cripple, would you? Tell me, do you honestly believe you still belong at her side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze turned ice-cold as he locked eyes with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a low chuckle. &#34;I know about your leg, Cedric. A man like you won&#39;t heal anytime soon,and even if you do, you&#39;ll never be the same again.Daniela has a soft heart, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can manipulate her emotions for your own gain.You should step aside. Every relationship has its course, and yours with Daniela ended. It&#39;s time to move on.And in the end, I&#39;l be the one standing beside her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hearty laugh,Alexander turned and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained at Elite Lux&#39;s entrance, his gaze lifting towards the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s office light flickered on,her silhouette appeared by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion crashed over Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman the world had declared dead was alive,standing just within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He expected nothing anymore only gratitude filled his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever choice Daniela made-even if it led to divorce-he would accept it without resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was what she needed, he would endure anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many times, Cedric had convinced himself he wasn&#39;t worthy of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had stared at his reflection, at the injured leg, at the scars that carved stories into his skin. It wasn&#39;t just his leg-the burns stretched across his body,leaving his skin rough, uneven, ruined. He hid beneath high collars, his gait unsteady, trailing her from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride lay in pieces, but he still couldn&#39;t walk away.Not until Daniela demanded a divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, he would cling to the illusion, pretending he still had the right to stand beside her, pretending he was still her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Cedric&#39;s car remained stationed outside Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as he could lift his gaze and see her office light glowing, a quiet peace settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, Carol asked, &#34;Daniela, Phillips Group is steering all their business towards Elite Lux. Should we accept their offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes drifted to the car still stationed below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She no longer held strong feelings for Cedric, yet at times,something within her wavered-as if stirred by a distant echo of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from a distance, though his face remained unseen, Daniela could picture the depth of emotion swirling in Cedric&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer intensity of his emotions unsettled her,  stirring a quiet unease within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But every now and then, the quiet sorrow in Cedric&#39;s eyes sent a sharp pang through Daniela&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a tangled storm of emotions, heavy and consuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was firm. &#34;Tell him 1appreciate it, but I&#39;ll handle things on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words faded, hailstones started hammering down, rattling against the world outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news anchor announced, &#34;Temperatures are set to plummet tonight, bringing a relentless downpour of large hailstones for over five hours. Those still out on the roads should seek shelter immediately. The city is bracing for its first major cold snap of the year,so residents are urged to take precautions and stay warm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol trailed Daniela&#39;s gaze, spotting a modest yet familiar car nestled among the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hail&#39;s coming down hard. Some cars are already taking a beating, and the temperature&#39;s still dropping.We might see snow soon,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond, her thoughts veiled in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy stillness settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Carol turned and walked out. The storm intensified. Alexander arrived with a late-night meal, instructing security to send it up to Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his way out, Alexander spotted Cedric&#39;s car. With a smirk, he honked-loud, taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling down his window, Alexander sneered. &#34;Cedric,this hail&#39;s coming down hard-your car won&#39;t last. Stop embarrassing yourself and get out of here. If you&#39;ve got any self-respect left, follow my car and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice boomed through the street, catching the attention of passersby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers turned, their eyes locking onto Cedric,sitting motionless in his car with the window cracked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the scene exploded across social media,thrusting Cedric into trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Phillips Embarrassing Himself.&#34;</p>
