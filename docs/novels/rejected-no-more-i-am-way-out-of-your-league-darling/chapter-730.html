                <p>Silence lingered on the other side of the phone as Hamilton processed Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped him eventually. &#34;To think the founder of Elite Lux, once deemed the wealthiest globally, could still impress me-remarkable indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding often required no explanation; the wise grasped it quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was ready to show her cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trusted that Hamilton would not harm Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Hamilton could not assure that his children were safe from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, a fearsome mercenary leader, had nothing to do with his sons. If she chose to kill them all, he could do nothing about it. Holding the phone, Daniela continued, &#34;Mr. McCoy,it&#39;s time the younger ones took over. The future belongs to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had the call on speaker. The room&#39;s occupants stared at him, astonished by the boldness of the caller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had led McCoy Group for decades. It was time for him to retire. But relinquishing power was not easy for someone who had wielded it so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words echoed the silent thoughts of many in the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity surged as they wondered who could embarrass Hamilton so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re brave. The last one who dared talk like this no longer breathes,&#34; Hamilton responded with narrowed eyes and a serene demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reply was colder. &#34;Go ahead and try.Fortune often favors me, turning the odds in my favor.&#34;  Hamilton paused, then laughed heartily. &#34;Alright! Ms.Harper, you never disappoint. I have only one request. They can fight and compete however they want, but just don&#39;t let it end in death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no current plans to harm Hamilton&#39;s children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before ending the call, Hamilton chuckled. &#34;I eagerly anticipate our meeting, Ms. Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had assumed that Daniela&#39;s boldness would distance Hamilton and lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he tried to reach Hamilton, there was no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of options, he called Hamilton&#39;s ever-present assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant&#39;s voice was tinged with concern,remembering Daniela&#39;s stern words. &#34;This time, it&#39;s serious. Your father won&#39;t intervene. You&#39;re on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned. &#34;So, my father will just stand by  and watch us battle it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had always interpreted Hamilton&#39;s silence as passive approval of his inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was taken aback by the sudden change in strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant suggested, &#34;Your father holds Ms.Harper in high regard. If resistance proves futile, why not join forces with her? It&#39;s better to have the wise as allies rather than enemies, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the conversation ended, a thoughtful expression crossed Nikolas&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he really consider friendship with Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her goals seemed boundless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of aligning with her felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Nikolas&#39; perspective, Daniela wasn&#39;t just after the culprit; she was also pursuing justice for Cedric&#39;s bitter childhood. What other reason could there be for her interest in the McCoy wealth? Despite no longer being the wealthiest in the world,Daniela was hardly in need of funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cooperation with Charles stemmed from her loyalty to Cedric, not from any desire for financial gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. Given Daniela&#39;s dedication to Cedric, he decided to take action against Cedric himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nikolas, Daniela was merely a renowned mercenary. As the eldest heir to a vast fortune, he felt destined to prevail. What was there to fear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Daniela who should be worried!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric came back, Nikolas quietly intercepted him along the path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Cedric stepping out of the car with a grave demeanor, Nikolas noted his duplicity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was always gentle around Daniela. With others, however, his face was as impassive and cold as marble. &#34;Cedric, let&#39;s talk.&#34; Nikolas drew near and addressed Cedric politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing between us that merits discussion,&#34;Cedric responded with a cool lift of his eyelids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not anything else, perhaps we could discuss Daniela?&#34; Nikolas proposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric&#39;s driver pulled away, the two made their way to a nearby pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re aware Danielais backing Charles now, right?&#34;Nikolas broached the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you aspire to rise to power yourself, Cedric?&#34;Nikolas probed further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a measured glance at Nikolas, Cedric understood that such generosity would not be offered without a motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sole reason Nikolas would approach him was out of a sense of threat. Without a doubt, that threat had come from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you want me to join your side?&#34; Cedric had made it clear he had no interest in the McCoy fortune, recognizing Nikolas&#39; approach as both a test and an attempt at alliance. &#34;You want me to deal with my wife?&#34;</p>
