                <p>Linden sneered. &#34;I&#39;m at a loss. Natalie, you&#39;re Daniela&#39;s secretary. To throw such bait in front of a pack of reporters-what&#39;s your angle? What do you expect me to confess? Or perhaps, what tale would you have me spin for the press?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression soured on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden pressed on, &#34;You just waxed lyrical about the rule of law. Remember,peddling rumors could land you in hot water, so let&#39;s steer clear of weaving tall tales.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse tensed, her hand raised to strike Linden,but Natalie intercepted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a plastered smile still gracing her features.Natalie addressed the press. &#34;Excuse us, could we pause the live feed for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters agreed,but their microphones remained live, ostensibly &#34;overlooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious, Natalie went on, &#34;Guys, my apologies for the hiccup. Might I ask you to wait outside for a short while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur ran through the crowd. Natalie raised her hand, showing a number. &#34;Rest assured, I&#39;ll make it worth your while once we&#39;ve sorted things out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the promised sum signaled by her fingers, the reporters quickly dispersed with gleaming eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the room now silent, Natalie&#39;s facade crumbled instantly.&#34;Linden,what&#39;s the meaning of this charade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stormed over and delivered the slap she had restrained earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning nonchalantly against the couch, Linden offered only an indifferent grin in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse demanded, &#34;Where&#39;s Daniela? Why the sudden flip in your story? Do you realize the mess you&#39;ve just made of my carefully laid plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden touched his lip, savoring the taste of blood,yet remained unperturbed. He locked eyes with Natalie.&#34;Daniela&#39;s not here. I&#39;ve stashed her elsewhere.Without me, you won&#39;t be able to find her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie,feeling his intense gaze, simmered with rage but kept her fury in check. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cynical laugh, Linden replied, &#34;What do I want?Surely you&#39;ve known all along.&#34; His grin grew more sardonic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s demeanor hardened. &#34;Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spreading his arms wide, Linden countered, &#34;Then  don&#39;t expect Daniela to waltz back in here. I might be daring, but I&#39;m no fool. Natalie, from day one you knew my intentions. You&#39;ve played me like a fool. Now, the ball&#39;s in your court. Stay or go-it&#39;s your call.&#34; He gestured towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression darkened further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse attempted to mediate. &#34;Once we&#39;re through with this, I&#39;ll honor our agreement. Didn&#39;t you just share a night with Daniela? Pace yourself,young man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Linden and Daniela&#39;s fervent night sent a thrill through Elyse, her featues contorting with delight. Yet the thought of Natalie in Daniela&#39;s place soured her mood instantly. The contempt on Natalie&#39;s face was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your choice. Either Natalie sleeps with me,or you go explain the mix-up to the reporters. Remember,you&#39;ve promised them silence money. If Daniela survives, can you cover that bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression tightened. What Linden didn&#39;t know was that they had already spent over millions downstairs the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse bit her lip, eyeing the sealed door, then made a desperate decision. &#34;Natalie, perhaps you should...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;slips tightened into a thin line, recognizing her lack of options. She faced Linden with frosty disdain &#34;You have five minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s laugh was mocking. &#34;Five minutes won&#39;t cut  it.It should last as long as you planned with Daniela-hours,not moments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in horror. Such a loathsome prospect-for hours? She could as well meet her end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then decide. The choice is yours.&#34; Linden eyed the still-charming Elyse with a smirk. &#34;Elyse, perhaps you&#39;d like to join?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s rage nearly boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not dally,&#34; Linden said, sensing Natalie&#39;s facade.&#34;Don&#39;t push me to ask for ten days and nights. That might be more than you can withstand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Natalie stormed off to the bathroom.Her fists clenched as she walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved that Linden would pay with his life once this ordeal was over.</p>
