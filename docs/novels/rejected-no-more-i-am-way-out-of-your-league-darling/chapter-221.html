                <p>Joyce flashed her brightest smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Richard asked, &#34;So, what about Joyce&#39;s dowry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caused Katrina and Caiden to hesitate momentarily, their polished expressions cracking ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Joyce could tell the truth, Katrina stepped in, masking any tension with a light laugh. &#34;Richard, you&#39;re as thorough as ever. Joyce is our daughter, after all. There&#39;s no question we&#39;d give her the best in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, a veteran in the business world, was far too sharp to be placated by empty reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted a straightforward answer. With a polite smile, he lowered his gaze slightly and said, &#34;Of course,it&#39;s not about the amount Joyce brings. We value her as a person. But, as you know, we move in high-society circles. If Joyce&#39;s dowry falls short of expectations, it&#39;s not just Joyce who would face criticism. The Harper family&#39;s reputation would also be at stake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s heart swelled with happiness at the phrase &#34;we value her as a person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she felt even more assured of the Bennett family&#39;s genuine regard for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she resolved to repay Richard&#39;s thoughtfulness someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Katrina and Caiden weren&#39;t fooled. Beneath Richard&#39;s courteous tone, they recognized his subtle probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They also grasped the true reason why the Bennett family had welcomed Joyce, even with her child. It wasn&#39;t about Joyce as a person-it was the advantages that came with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile didn&#39;t waver as she responded seamlessly, &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. Joyce means the world to us. We&#39;d never allow her to be a subject of ridicule. As we mentioned earlier, our shares and villa will all At this, Richard&#39;s expression eased, appearing satisfied for the moment. &#34;And when can we expect the paperwork to be finalized?&#34; He wasn&#39;t the kind of man who could be swayed with vague promises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all taken care of!&#34; Katrina said with a reassuring smile. &#34;The shares have been in Joyce&#39;s name for quite some time. We just kept it quiet to steer clear of any unnecessary issues. Don&#39;t worry; wve&#39;d never cut corners when it comes to Joyce. At the wedding, you&#39;ll have all the documents-the equity transfer agreement and the villa&#39;s deed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard looked like he was about to ask more, but Katrina quickly added, &#34;Come on, we&#39;re about to be family.Do you honesty think we&#39;d lie to you about something so crucial? Do you want to come home with us and inspect the safe? Joyce is our one and only daughter. There&#39;s no way we&#39;d treat her unfairly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this stage, there wasn&#39;t much more Richard could say. Reluctantly, he let the matter rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the table, Joyce clenched her fork so tightly that her knuckles turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had been a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had deceived Richard the same way they had deceived her. Caiden had never planned to hand over the assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing but a charade!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger seared through her, but she kept it buried deep. She knew that making a scene now would mean throwing away everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Richard picked up his phone and called Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The background noise of lively music and voices made it clear Alexander was at a bar. Richard&#39;s brow furrowed in disapproval. &#34;Are you there for business, or are you just out enjoying yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice sounded muffled and distant. &#34;What do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard explained everything from the dinner, including Katrina&#39;s assurances about Joyce&#39;s dowry.Alexander responded with a dismissive laugh, &#34;Katrina dotes on Joyce. She won&#39;t let her go into marriage empty-handed. Stop worrying about it. Let them sort out their problems. If they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll come crawling to Daniela eventually. We&#39;ll get what we need, one way or another. And let&#39;s face it, no matter how hard you push, Joyce will never be Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stared at the phone, regret shadowing his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how things went, Joyce could never be Daniela.</p>
