                <p>As Alexander was heading home, his phone vibrated.It was a call from his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a concert tonight. I&#39;ve given your secretary the ticket. You should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was caught off guard. His father had always brushed off anything that didn&#39;t help the family business, calling it a waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, out of nowhere, he was offering a ticket to a concert?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the things Alexander had once found exciting in his younger years no longer seemed to hold much appeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a half-hearted agreement, though he had no real intention of going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was until Richard added, &#34;I&#39;ve just heard that Daniela will be there too. Every rich bachelor will be attending tonight. Alexander, I know you&#39;re too proud to approach Daniela, but tonight could be your perfect chance. Of course, the choice is yours. If you don&#39;t seize it, someone else surely will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexander could say anything,Richard hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gazed at the glowing city lights, his father&#39;s words echoing in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached the next intersection, he turned the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olisvine was famous for its impressive skyline,from its opulent skyscrapers to its famnous landmarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the most distinguished of them all was its concert hall, the largest in the nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The concert hall drew the country&#39;s top musicians and stood as a symbol of elegance and artistry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had planned to head home after the auction,but Lillian insisted on taking her to the concert hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The maestros have been eager to meet you.You own this place, but other than skimming the year-end reports, you&#39;ve completely ignored it. Don&#39;t you feel a little guilty as the boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Daniela&#39;s objections, Lillian managed to pull her along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cello had been Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s favorite instrument. Her mother&#39;s biggest wish was for her to pursue music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the family fell apart, so did that dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For more than ten years, Daniela had pursued Alexander relentlessly, and throughout all that time,she had never once stepped foot in the concert hall again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as she entered through its familiar doors, a rush of memories and nostalgia hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, the senior maestros stood waiting. As soon as they spotted Daniela, they bowed in unison,greeting her respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were people who had known her since she was a child, some who had even cradled her in their arms.Now, seeing her as an adult, they couldn&#39;t help but sigh at how quickly time had flown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging pleasantries, the maestros politely excused themselves to get ready for the performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall&#39;s director remained behind to stay with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving at a young man who had been closely following them, the director introduced, &#34;This is my grandson. He just returned from abroad. You two will have plenty to chat about. He&#39;ll be your guide for the evening while I take care of things backstage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled politely and nodded. &#34;That sounds fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young man had a warm, friendly smile. When Daniela smiled at him, his face turned bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian chuckled, leaning in to nudge Daniela&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knock it off,&#34; Daniela muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian turned to the young man and asked loudly,&#34;Hey, handsome, up for some fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young man&#39;s face turned even redder, but he answered sincerely, &#34;Sure,&#34; then slowly looked up to meet Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave his shoulder an encouraging pat. &#34;You&#39;ve got potential!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the concert started, Alexander had finally shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had gotten him a prime front-row seat. As soon as he stepped into the hall, all eyes were on him,and the hall felt like it shifted with the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stares weren&#39;t exactly discreet. Everyone was looking at him-the ex-husband-wondering what on earth he was doing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he here trying to win her back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,all the gazes turned cautious and on guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ignored the stares and sat down. A guy next to him pulled at his sleeve, and Alexander turned to find his friend, Keith Clayton, grinning at him.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,well, what brings you here?&#34; Keith asked with that familiar grin of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced over at Daniela. She was sitting a few rows away,completely lost in the performance,not even noticing he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so different from before. In the past,no matter how crowded it was, she&#39;d always spot him right away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weird frustration bubbled up inside him. He instinctively went to loosen his tie but stopped himself when he remembered where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, always the talker, wasn&#39;t too interested in the classical music. He scanned the hall, looking at all the young heirs, and couldn&#39;t help but chuckle under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in and whispered to Alexander, &#34;Hey, did you notice? Half of Olisvine&#39;s golden boys are here tonight, and I&#39;m willing to bet that they&#39;re all here for Daniela. I bet most of them don&#39;t even know what&#39;s happening on stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith smirked and shook his head. &#34;Crazy, right? Back in the day, Daniela was always ignored, stuck under her stepmother&#39;s control. And now? She&#39;s a CEO.I even told her once that she wasn&#39;t good enough for you. Funny how life has a way of proving you wrong,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added with a grin, &#34;But enough about that. You&#39;ve got to admit, she looks amazing tonight. That gown?It&#39;s from Elite Lux, custom-made. I heard it&#39;s worth five million and still rising. She&#39;s really turning heads.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed silent. His gaze turned from the stage to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since leaving the auction, she had changed into a breathtaking gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft, tranquil shade of blue reminded him of a peaceful lake, its beauty drawing the eye of anyone nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was elegantly styled in an updo, and her posture was flawless, with her long,graceful neck held high like that of a regal swan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat there quietly, completely absorbed in the performance, oblivious to the chatter swirling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith let out another laugh. &#34;So, what do you think?Does Daniela even get the music, or is she just playing along to fit in with the fancy crowd?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze flickered back to the stage,his voice calm and distant. &#34;She doesn&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith grinned knowingly. &#34;I figured as much. People with money love to act like they&#39;re all about the fine arts. It&#39;s more about looking cultured than actually understanding it. And honestly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, the performance ended, and the crowd burst into applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director of the concert hall walked onto the stage,microphone in hand, his expression warm and welcoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, everyone. I have the honor of being the director here, and tonight, it&#39;s my privilege to introduce a very special guest, Daniela Harper,the owner of this venue. She&#39;s been an accomplished musician since childhood, particularly with the cello.It&#39;s been many years since I&#39;ve had the pleasure of hearing her play, and I must ask-are we fortunate enough to hear her perform for us tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rang out, leaving the audience stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had been distracted by their phones,making calls, or thinking about leaving suddenly stopped.
