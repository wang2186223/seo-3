                <p>Brad threw up a hand, stopping Ethan mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brad, have you lost your mind?&#34; said Ethan, his voice urgent. &#34;Did Josh really put you up to this? Are you going after Daniela because of him? Josh is always pulling strings from the shadows. And you&#39;re just another pawn. If he wanted her gone, why didn&#39;t he do it himself? Why sent you? He already tricked me twice.And you&#39;re still following his orders? If this comes out,Hamilton will come for your neck. Why drag yourself into this mess? You lost money. Fine. But that&#39;s not the end of the world. Didn&#39;t you invest in Daniela&#39;s company? You&#39;ll get dividends. So why are you doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t speak right away. After a long pause, he muttered, &#34;Josh promised me forty percent of McCoy Group&#39;s shares if I take care of Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was forty percent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan scoffed, &#34;And you actually believe him? Even if McCoy Group gets rebuilt, what makes you think Josh could keep it running? If you go through with this,Hamilton won&#39;t forgive you. And he won&#39;t lift a finger to help you run anything either. What&#39;s the point of owning forty percent of a company that won&#39;t last?Even if you owned all of it, it&#39;s still built on sand.&#34; Ethan leaned in, speaking slowly now. &#34;Daniela&#39;s different. She fought for everything she has. You&#39;ve seen her work. You&#39;ve seen what she can do. Do you really think you&#39;ll be broke if you stand with her instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t answer. His fingers wrapped tight around the fruit knife in his pocket, then released. Again and again. His thoughts spun in circles. None of it made sense anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, unaware of the storm inside him, kept trying &#34;Come on, Brad. Let this go. Please. Don&#39;t throw yourself away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brad couldn&#39;t listen. His head was full of noise.And then it hit him. He had already started poisoning Daniela. It was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped his gaze and whispered, &#34;No, Ethan. I can&#39;t stop now. Tomorrow&#39;s the final day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;You&#39;re insane. Completely insane. I&#39;m telling Daniela.&#34; He spun on his heel,ready to leave. But before he could get far, Brad yanked him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39; face twisted with murderous intent. Cold and sharp,his voice cut through the space. &#34;No. You can&#39;t tell Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wrong move, and everything would collapse. If Daniela found out, Cedric would lose control. And Hamilton wouldn&#39;t spare him either. It wasn&#39;t just one life on the line-it was three. There was no room for mistakes. Absolutely none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes were wild, streaked with red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, please,&#34; he said, clutching the knife inside his coat pocket. &#34;I&#39;ve always been nice to you. You know that, don&#39;t you? Just this once. Listen to me. I need you to stay quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in Brad&#39;s tone sent a chill down Ethan&#39;s spine. He paused, reading the panic behind the rage.His pulse jumped. Then, forcing a tight smile, he said,&#34;Alright. I hear you. I won&#39;t tell her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away, steps light, almost cautious. But after just two strides, he felt it. Cold steel pressed against his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan froze. Slowly, he looked over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then pain exploded through him. A warm rush spread across his lower back, sharp and blinding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;Brad...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spilled from his mouth as his knees buckled.He ht the floor with a lifeless thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad crouched beside him, his hands soaked in red. In his mind, Ethan&#39;s voice kept replaying. &#34;I&#39;m going to tell Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39; breathing turned ragged. His eyes twitched with something close to madness. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ethan,&#34; he whispered. &#34;I can&#39;t lose everything. Not now. You have to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dragged the body into the bathroom and tossed it into the tub. Then he twisted the faucet on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of rushing water filled the room.Under the harsh light, with Ethan still watching in shock, Brad struck again. And again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood smeared the tiles, spiraling into the drain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan fought at first, fists weakly grasping Brad&#39;s clothes. &#34;Brad...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his grip faded. His voice vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the wet scrape of the fruit knife remained. And the endless sound of water washing it all away.</p>
