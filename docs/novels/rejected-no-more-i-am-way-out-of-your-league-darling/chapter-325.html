                <p>The voice on the other end was low, its coldness cutting through the line. &#34;Katrina, have you lost your mind? Why are you even mentioning that? So many years have passed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina could feel herself slipping, as though her grip on the situation was slowly fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps,it had already slipped away entirely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to bring it up either. But Daniela won&#39;t let me go. The one losing it now is her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina knew reconciliation with Daniela was impossible, that much was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her decision had already been made-to leave the Harper family and divorce Caiden-but Daniela wasn&#39;t backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every move Daniela made had been carefully  &#34;What&#39;s the worst that could happen? Does Daniela even have proof? These events happened ages ago.Why drag them up now? If I&#39;m stuck in this mess,you&#39;ll be dragged down with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I want to talk about this?&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice cracked as she stormed through the courtyard,her steps frantic. &#34;But Daniela is relentless! Have you seen the latest about Joyce? She&#39;s pushed me to this point, and she won&#39;t stop. She wants nothing more than to destroy me. If you don&#39;t do something,I&#39;ll pull you down with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury twisted Katrina&#39;s face, her teeth grinding together as her eyes burned with vengeful fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the real fool here! And you think you can bring me down? If this goes wrong, I&#39;ll drag you and Joyce down with me! You had the poerfect hand,and you ruined it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through Katrina, her body trembling with frustration. &#34;Do whatever you need to do. But if l die, everything will come to light. And you-along with everyone else behind you-will fall with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After those words, Katrina&#39;s gaze shifted. She froze,her breath catching for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with the phone still pressed to her ear, she slowly lifted her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, a surveillance camera blinked steadily, its red light flashing ominously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, she ended the call abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Daniela left for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her driver, ever observant, broke the silence, his voice low. &#34;We&#39;ve got two groups tailing us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back in her seat, her expression casual.&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver&#39;s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, his voice calm as he said to Daniela, &#34;There are now three groups tailing us.&#34; With a subtle turn of her head, Daniela&#39;s gaze shifted to assess the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of cold intent gleamed in her eyes,so fleeting that even the driver, sharp as he was, failed to catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up at Elite Lux. As Daniela stepped out, both Lillian and Ryan appeared from the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Lillian greeted her, her eyes scanning the crowd of passersby. &#34;Why would Katrina go this far?There are at least five groups tailing you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A realization settled in Daniela&#39;s mind, slowly taking shape. The pieces clicked together. &#34;It&#39;s not Katrina.She doesn&#39;t have the reach for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced at Daniela with caution, &#34;Then who&#39;s behind this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;I don&#39;t know yet. But if we want to catch them, we need to be patient. They&#39;re too impatient. It&#39;s only a matter of time before they make their move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a brief nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that day forward, a strange series of events began unfolding around Daniela, each one more bizarre than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when she was on her way to a cafe for a business meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped out of the building, a vase toppled from the twentieth floor, shattering just inches from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security team rushed upstairs without delay, but when they arrived, there was no sign of what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, on her way to work, her car&#39;s tire exploded,and within moments, both the steering wheel and brakes malfunctioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as she parked after work, a fleeting figure darted past her, barely visible in the shadows. Lillian had been keeping an especially close watch on Daniela in recent days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;They&#39;re not holding back. These must be top-tier mercenaries. If they keep failing, they&#39;ll escalate to more drastic tactics soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela remained unruffled, her voice calm as she responded, &#34;Let them try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relentless string of incidents surrounding Daniela had escalated to a point where even Cedric couldn&#39;t ignore them any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; Daniela murmured gently, her head resting on Cedric&#39;s chest that evening. &#34;Lillian&#39;s by my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she was hurt today, and both of you are women.How can you handle this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hands trembled as the memory of the harrowing event replayed in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car, out of contro, veered recklessly on the overpass, its tires spinning wildly until the front slammed into the guardrail, finally bringing it to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s hand was injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no hesitation, Daniela, Lilian and the driver scrambled out of the car. Barely a minute later, the vehicle erupted in an explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Cedric watched in horror, his legs giving way as he staggered out of his car.</p>
