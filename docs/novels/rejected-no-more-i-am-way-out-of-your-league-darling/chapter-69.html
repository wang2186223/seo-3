                <p>Keith&#39;s sigh was heavy with exasperation as he shook his head. &#34;Stay stubborn if that&#39;s what you want. Let&#39;s see how long that pride of yours lasts when reality hits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the gala drew to a close, Alexander couldn&#39;t help but monitor Daniela&#39;s every move. His car followed hers, maintaining a discreet distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Daniela&#39;s vehicle, her driver peered into the rearview mirror and noted, &#34;Ms. Harper, there&#39;s a car that&#39;s been tailing us since you got in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head slightly, her piercing eyes quickly recognizing the familiar car-it was Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relaxing into her seat, she instructed in a steady voice, &#34;Just ignore it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two cars wove through the city streets in a quiet pursuit, finally coming to a halt outside the imposing Luxor Tower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela stepped out, Alexander intercepted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her weary eyes to meet his gaze. Despite the fatigue weighing on her, she remained poised. &#34;Mr.Bennett,do you need something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tailed her car relentlessly, shadowing her all the way to the office building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Cedric are not right for each other,&#34; he declared bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising an eyebrow, Daniela responded, &#34;Don&#39;t you have more important things to attend to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a thin line as his eyes widened slightly, struggling to mask his disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed on, her tone dripping with challenge. &#34;Or have you really become so unoccupied that you stoop to meddling in your ex-wife&#39;s affairs? Haven&#39;t you ever heard the saying, &#39;The best kind of ex is one you never hear from again&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face grew stern, his jaw clenching with quiet intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of her laughter mingling with Cedric&#39;s ignited a sharp, unbidden irritation within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. If you insist on being stubborn, just remember not to come crying to me when things go wrong. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed his remark with a nonchalant wave of her hand. She attempted to brush past him,but Alexander extended his arm, barring her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was there something more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied tersely, his tone cutting through the chill air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, giving him a fleeting look.&#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Alexander had resolved to let Daniela seek him out. Yet, a nagging unease twisted in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had a knack for poor decisions, and if she aligned herself with another company instead of the Bennett Group, it would inevitably drag him into yet another conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of deliberation, he opted to confront the issue directly. &#34;I&#39;ve got a deal you might find interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze on her, her features bathed in the ethereal moonlight. His fingers tightened into a fist,then he consciously relaxed, striving to smooth his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke again, his voice softened into a husky whisper, carrying a hint of intimacy. &#34;This isn&#39;t the right spot for this conversation. Let&#39;s head up to your apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed Alexander with a mixture of confusion and caution, taking a deliberate step back. &#34;I don&#39;t think that would be appropriate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of frustration quickly passed over Alexander&#39;s face, his annoyance clearly rising to the surface.&#34;Why do you find it inappropriate with me, yet it seems okay when it&#39;s Cedric? Daniela, don&#39;t you understand? For a woman, being loyal-showing devotion to one man-is paramount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night breeze played with Daniela&#39;s hair, adding a dramatic flair as she faced him, her features sculpted with both shock and disdain. &#34;Are you suggesting that I should keep chasing you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of regret passed through Alexander&#39;s eyes. He brought a fist to his mouth, disguising a cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I mean is that you shouldn&#39;t be so fickle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, observing him closely. Once upon a time, this clumsy, awkward aspect of Alexander might have amused her, even seemed charming-as if she were glimpsing a part of him that remained hidden from everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those pathetic days were dead and buried. Daniela wasn&#39;t that reckless fool anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to leave, but not before casting a parting shot over her shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s late, and frankly, you being here reeks of desperation. As for your so-called proposition, partnerships require integrity-something I&#39;m not sure you understand. There&#39;s no common ground between Elite Lux&#39;s principles and those of Bennett Group. If you&#39;re here to discuss the North District project, save your breath-I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s rejection was absolute, leaving no room for argument or delusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was left motionless, shock rendering him silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a few moments beforehis secretary approached, piercing the heavy silence. &#34;Mr. Bennett, Ms.Harper has already gone inside. Perhaps we should also leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared in disbelief where Daniela had vanished, struggling to pull himself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to his secretary, his voice tinged with confusion. &#34;What did she mean by that?&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary bowed his head slightly, his words measured. &#34;Ms. Harper was indicating that the North District project will proceed without Bennett Group&#39;s involvement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander blinked, his thoughts scrambling to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Bennett Group wasn&#39;t her choice, then who did she turn to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clayton Renovation was out of the picture. In the entire city of Olisvine, no other firm possessed the resources or expertise needed for such a massive endeavor. It had to be him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a cold, biting laugh that echoed in the frosty air. &#34;She&#39;s got to be bluffing.&#34;</p>
