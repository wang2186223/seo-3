                <p>As soon as Daniela picked up the phone, Cedric&#39;s gaze snapped toward her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quietly shifted a step closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela hung up, Cedric stood straighter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to head back upstairs, and Cedric trailed after her without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela came downstairs, she found Cedric already dressed and ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought a hand to his lips and let out a purposefully refined cough. &#34;I heard it. I was invited too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow and shot him a pointed look. He had impressive hearing. &#34;So, you&#39;re planning to go alone?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked at her. &#34;Wait, you&#39;re not going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a long look. &#34;Since you&#39;re so excited,why don&#39;t you』 go by yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly lost interest and was about to turn back to change into something more casual when the door suddenly swung open</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol popped her head inside and chirped, &#34;Daniela,are you ready? Should we head out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a brief nod and headed for the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hurried after her, grumbling under his breath,&#34;You tricked me! You were planning to go all along!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela threw him a sideways glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had already moved to open the car door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol flashed a smile at Daniela, who climbed into the car with a resigned sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they neared the McCoy family residence, Daniela gave a piece of advice. &#34;Hamilton invited us to dinner today. Just as you suspected, he might see you as a suitable option. If anyone asks, just mention that you&#39;re following my plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela finished speaking, Cedric stayed quiet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric inquired, &#34;Does this mean you&#39;re letting me stay here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, driving the car, glanced over and teased,&#34;Cedric,  you&#39;re improving.&#34; Cedric laughed,glancing at Daniela, &#34;What&#39;s your take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;If you don&#39;t agree, I&#39;ll just barge in later and claim I&#39;m ready to join the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to speak when the car came to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s personal secretary stood by the door,accompanied by a muscular man in a suit, likely Hamilton&#39;s newly hired bodyguard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instantly recognized him as a trained fighter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at him, his gaze lingering briefly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Daniela replied, not in the mood for any humor. Opening the car door and stepping out,she whispered to Cedric, &#34;Stay close once we&#39;re inside.Don&#39;t stray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, his face serious. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was enormous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The path was illuminated with bright lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed the secretary and the muscular man into the house. Halfway down the hallway, the lights suddenly flickered out with a snap</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surroundings were immediately engulfed in an eerie darkness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instinctively lifted her hand,positioning Cedric behind her. In the next instant, she felt a powerful punch heading toward her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she prepared to retaliate, she felt a gentle tug on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflexively, she dodged the blow. A loud noise rang out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of fists clashing echoed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spun around in shock, but the darkness was so dense, like an endless black veil, that she couldn&#39;t see a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed it was Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called out, &#34;Carol?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Carol&#39;s voice came from afar. &#34;We&#39;re under attack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a scuffle followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela furrowed her brow. Just as she was about to speak, she heard footsteps behind her. Just as she prepared to strike, a deep voice said,&#34;It&#39;s me.&#34; Daniela felt something secure around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll keep you safe,&#34; Cedricreassured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene became chaotic. As Daniela stood there,she sensed several people reaching for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just before they could make contact,they were knocked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was stunned, realizing Cedric was no ordinary man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut her eyes, recalling the layout from when they first entered, and figured out where the light switch was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent down, picking up a small stone from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift flick of her fingers, the garden lights of the villa flickered to life, one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was out of breath, gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if Daniela was alright. Daniela seemed less capable than she used to be. They had been battling for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head and saw Daniela standing off to the side, staring at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol traced Daniela&#39;s gaze.</p>
