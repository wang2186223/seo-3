                <p>Seconds passed,each one seemingly slower than the last.Yet,nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing impatient, Natalie attempted to call Cealmaur,only to find the line engaged. With no other options, she sent a text, requesting a callback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie kept waiting, but instead of hearing from Russell, it was Elyse who called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice shook over the phone. &#34;Natalie, it&#39;s urgent. Our house is occupied by outsiders. You and Nina need to come back right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been so sure of herself, and the villa was sold so quickly, that she nearly forgot she&#39;d even put it up for sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arriva1, Nina and Natalie were confronted by an elderly man clutching the property title, saying.&#34;Ladies, this property now belongs to my boss. Today marks the final day for you to clear out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela and her friends were just dropping off Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the old man, Daniela turned to Cedric and inquired, &#34;What&#39;s your opinion on this villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiring the surroundings, Cedric responded, &#34;It&#39;s outstanding. Your mother has exquisite taste. This hillside villa is indeed a rare find, and I&#39;ve heard its interiors are just as carefully designed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Lillian overheard Daniela say, &#34;Let me know if it catches your fancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, gazing at the elderly man with the deed,felt a strange sense of recognition. As he pondered this familiarity, he absentmindedly said, &#34;I do like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric admitted his fondness, a subtle smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;Then it&#39;s yours-a wedding gift from your mother-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric snapped his head around. &#34;Huh? What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Elyse was in a state of panic. She approached Daniela, indifferent to the rain soaking her. Her hair, disheveled and wet, stuck to her face.&#34;Daniela,you&#39;re well-connected with many friends and lawyers. Can you help me resolve this? It&#39;s outright extortion! I never sold the villa. This villa was a valuable gift from your mother. I&#39;d never part with it.not for anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the protection of an umbrella held by Cedric,Daniela looked on with a cold gaze. &#34;Is that so?&#34; The gift was valuable, yet it seemed unappreciated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Elyse said with conviction. &#34;Selling this villa is something I would never do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze fell on Elyse, taking in her disarrayed state, her emotions detached and  cold. &#34;Maybe someone else in your family sold it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately. Elyse denied the possibility. &#34;No. it couldn&#39;t be. Nina is hardly ever home,and Natalie is too well-behaved. She&#39;s the jewel ive nurtured: she wouldn&#39;t think of selling the villa without my permission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. then suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s get the police involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Daniela was about to pick up her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stared at Daniela,her eyes pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold off on calling the police. I sold it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that.Elyse froze, her body rigid with shock for a long moment before she slowly turned to face Natalie, meeting her indifferent stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,I would have inherited everything eventually. It doesn&#39;t matter if I claim it now or later. We should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was utterly shaken. She hadn&#39;t foreseen her daughter&#39;s scheming, orchestrating such a betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie continued, &#34;Don&#39;t look so betrayed. You&#39;ve kept your secrets; now we&#39;re even. I just took ownership a little sooner. The villa&#39;s already been sold.It&#39;s not a big deal. I&#39;ll make sure we come out ahead financially.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse couldn&#39;t grasp that these words were coming from Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man gestured, prompting his people to start removing the items not listed in the sale contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that Elyse noticed her beloved antiques and paintings from Brylee were left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking,she asked Natalie, &#34;How much did you get for the villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie responded, &#34;One hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that figure,Elyse collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Daniela observed as Elyse and Natalie,clutching their few belongings,exited the villa,a sight of utter defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the downpour, Daniela&#39;s eyes lingered on the mist-enveloped villa, her laughter echoing coldly through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,do you see? I have retrieved everything from the people who betrayed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was thrown out. With their luggage in tow,she and her daughter headed to the Harper family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse said to Daniela, &#34;You&#39;ve let Nina stay; could you accommodate me and Natalie as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile crossed Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Misinterpreting this as an agreement, Elyse began to pull her suitcase inside, only to be stopped by Daniela, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we don&#39;t have any available rooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie stood with a knife, blocking the unwelcome people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, feeling a mix of desperation and hope, then turned to Nina. &#34;Nina, there&#39;s plenty of space in your room. Could your sister and I join you? We&#39;re family after all. It wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask, right?&#34;</p>
