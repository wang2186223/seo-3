                <p>Amid the disarray, Joyce sat nonchalantly, one hand tracing the edge of the freshly changed sheets, the other clutching a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply, her head tilted slightly back, exhaling a plume of smoke with a detached air.&#34;What is it you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even glance at Katrina, her indifference speaking louder than any words could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brows knitted tightly. Her eyes fell on the bruises marring Joyce&#39;s skin. &#34;You can&#39;t stay with someone like him. If he loses control, he could kill you. How could you get invoIved with a man like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce flicked the ash from her cigarette, her face remaining unreadable, unmoved by Katrina&#39;s concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it you want from me?&#34; Joyce&#39;s voice dripped with weariness, cutting through Katrina&#39;s attempt at sympathy. &#34;Spare me the act and get to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;Joyce, I&#39;m only saying this because I care about you. You&#39;re in your prime.Why would you throw it away on a man like Doug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rose from the bed. The marks covering her bare skin were glaringly evident, yet she moved with a calm indifference, unbothered by her own vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the bathroom, stepping under the spray of the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Streams of crimson trickled from her skin, swirling down the drain, only to reveal fresh wounds beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She showed no sign of pain, as though she had grown immune to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draping a towel around herself, she cast a scornful glance at Katrina and chuckled bitterly. &#34;Spare me that pitying look. Doug and I are married. What happens in our bedroom is no different than what you did to keep Caiden happy. You&#39;re no better than me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Katrina and Caiden making out-scenes witnessed by both Daniela and Joyce-flashed vividly through Joyce&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina froze, her lips trembling as tears welled up and spilled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And isn&#39;t this what you always preached? That a woman&#39;s purpose is to please men? I&#39;m just living the way you taught me. Tell me, did I get it wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina wept openly now, her head shaking in denial, unable to reconcile the image of her cherished daughter with the woman standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disappointment, heartbreak, and despair consumed her. She couldn&#39;t bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the very beginning, you drilled it into me-money always outweighs dignity,&#34; Joyce said, her tone icy and unyielding. &#34;You shaped me into this person, so don&#39;t pretend to be upset now. I don&#39;t need your pity.Just tell me why you&#39;re here. Doug&#39;s desires are insatiable, and he&#39;ll be back any moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pressed her hand over her mouth, disbelief etched across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of her wanted to walk away, dragging Joyce along with her. But reason quickly took over; she couldn&#39;t even sustain herself at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the reason she was here today was to ask Joyce for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stuck in her throat, but Joyce showed no urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reclined casually on the bed, her gaze fixed on a news report detailing the latest economic crisis,which had shaken multiple industries, including Alexander&#39;s Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, sarcastic smirk tugged at Joyce&#39;s lps. &#34;If that&#39;s all, you should go. I have other things to handle,&#34;she said, grabbing her phone to place a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I do,&#34; Katrina burst out, stopping Joyce just as she was turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce already knew why Katrina was here; it was all about the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had entered, urging her to leave Doug, but when it came to asking for cash, Katrina was hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce feigned ignorance, waiting for Katrina to spit it out. Katrina bit her lip nervously. &#34;I&#39;ve gone bankrupt. Can you lend me some money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you need?&#34; Joyce replied coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five hundred thousand,&#34; Katrina murmured hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce responded with a derisive laugh. &#34;Weren&#39;t you always calling my money dirty? Funny how it doesn&#39;t seemn so filthy now, huh? You&#39;re such a hypocrite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression stiffened, shame washing over her like a wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go. I&#39;ll send it to your account tomorrow,&#34; Joyce replied indifferently, her eyes fixed elsewhere as she strolled onto the balcony with her phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina cast Joyce a lingering glance, her teeth sinking into her lip before she turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way down, she crossed paths with Doug climbing the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes roved shamelessly to the neckline of her blouse, and a lecherous chuckle escaped his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Katrina hastened her steps, eager to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached the door, Doug&#39;s voice rang out from the staircase. &#34;Katrina, isn&#39;t it? My offer to your mother still applies. Anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran through Katrina at his comment. She spun around, her glare brimming with disdain, before bolting out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; Katrina staggered past the guard post, bending over as she retched uncontrollably.</p>
