                <p>Nikolas stood motionless, his gaze locked onto the photos in his hands, his mind frozen, struggling to process the moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr McCoy?&#34; The housekeeper&#39;s voice broke the silence, calling him once more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With slow, deliberate motion, Nikolas turned his head,his expression a strange blend of shock and an unmistakable joy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper recoiled slightly, taken off guard by the look of sheer surprise and uncontained joy on Nikolas&#39; face. &#34;Mr. McCoy, are you about to laugh, or cry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas erupted into laughter, the sound wild and unhinged, as if he&#39;d lost touch with reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper paused, uncertainty creeping into her voice as she pointed to the photos in his hand &#34;Your father made it clear no one was to touch them while he was upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of realization lit up in Nikolas&#39; eyes. &#34;Are they my father&#39;s?&#34; The housekeeper nodded gravely. &#34;Yes, but he told me to burn them I haven&#39;t had the chance yet. Mr McCoy,please hand them over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas waved her off, his tone light. &#34;No need for that. Go prepare my dinner instead. I want the finest seafood platter you&#39;ve got&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper blinked, her confusion clear &#34;But can you handle it? Your father insisted they photos must be burned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas waved a hand dismissively. &#34;If you can manage it, why can&#39;t l? Go on, I&#39;ll handle it. Just tell my father they&#39;ve been burned. Don&#39;t mention that I did it,though, or he&#39;ll say you&#39;re slacking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper nodded, her voice soft with surprise.&#34;Mr. McCoy, you&#39;re unusually thoughtful today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief, satisfied smile flickered on Nikolas&#39; lips. Once the housekeeper had gone, he eagerly inspected the photos once more before pulling out his phone to message Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming to see you at eight tonight. I&#39;ve got something important to show you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was sent, only to be immediately marked as rejected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nikolas stood frozen, speechless. With a lighthearted chuckle. Nikolas carried the photos upstairs, securing them carefully before making his way back down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had actually become involved with another man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Cedric found out? Wouldn&#39;t he lose his temper completely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric and Daniela ended things, Cedric would lose all his worth in Hamilton&#39;s eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas believed that would place him as the sole heir to McCoy Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Nikolas had been sinking into despair, but in this moment, he felt electrified, truly alive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With newfound energy, he made his way to dinner,his steps light. During the meal, Hamilton descended for a drink, his gaze briefly flicking to Nikolas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to the housekeeper, his voice sharp &#34;Has the folder been taken care of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper opened her mouth to respond,but Nikolas cut her off, unable to hold back &#34;Yes. I tried to check it, but she kept being all mysterious, saying l couldn&#39;t. Father, what was in that folder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes clouded with anger, and he stayed  silent for a long beat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he turned and ascended the stairs, his expression heavy with discontent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was swept away by a storm of emotions. Was his father angry because of those photos?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Daniela had become involved with another man, he still felt the urge to protect her-and that meant protecting Cedric too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This proved that his father truly favored Cedric above all else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his teeth, and once he was certain Hamilton had retreated upstairs, he snatched the photos and stormed out of the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood by the glass window of his study,watching Nikolas leave with a heavy sigh of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy heir couldn&#39;t afford to be an impulsive fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas headed straight for Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The renovation of the company building was finished,and now, it was all about placing the finishing touches with the right decor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was obsessively meticulous, scrutinizing every detail. When Nikolas arrived, Cedric was overseeing workers as they adjusted the placement of an antique vase</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fine-tuning its position, ensuring it was perfect</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sneered with disdain, &#34;You&#39;ve still got time for this?&#34;</p>
