                <p>Erika looked at Joyce with disbelief. &#34;Is plastic surgery what you&#39;re talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded. &#34;Exactly. It involves completely transforming oneself to look like someone else.It&#39;s similar to sculpting a new identity, reshaping oneself from the inside out to imitate someone else, followed by professional training to mimic that person accurately. In five months, Alexander will be a different person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika&#39;s eyes widened with curiosity. &#34;Who is Alexander going to turn into?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce opened the car door in front of her. Before stepping in, she glanced towards Cedric&#39;s ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft,warm light glowed from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a slight smile and responded, &#34;Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had not returned home these days. She spent all her available time at the hospital after work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experts from various countries were present there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the lead doctor came in with a serious look  and told Daniela, &#34;Our suspicions wee true. The problem is related to the food. Please provide a thorough list of everything Mr. Phillips ate in the week earlier before his illness for our investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, and Ryan quickly started to review the computer surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, the lead doctor introduced someone to Daniela. &#34;This is Linden Potter, a graduate student I&#39;m supervising this year. He will document Mr. Phillips &#39;reactions to the recent medications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed the man named Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a white doctor&#39;s coat, stood about five feet three inches tall, had a thinning hairline, and looked rather messy, with an unsettling air about him. His smile was cool, and his eyes, behind thick glasses,seemed chillingly detached, giving off an uncomfortable vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held her tongue in his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Linden left, Daniela told the lead doctor, &#34;I&#39;d prefer a different doctor. Monitoring medication reactions is critical, and I cannot trust the care of my loved one to someone who doesn&#39;t even keep himself presentable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lead doctor quickly grasped the situation. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the inconvenience. We had arranged for a  more experienced doctor for this task, but due to a flight issue, that doctor was delayed. Linden might seem a bit messy, but I will remind him to tidy up.In three days, the doctor we initially planned will arrive,and I will replace Linden at that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden came back with the medications, pausing outside the door to listen on the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted his glasses, a scheming grin spreading across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was surprised to find that Daniela was not only beautiful but also sharp. Just one look at him and she had requested his replacement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a shame,he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor who was supposed to take the notes would never return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden observed Daniela from outside, surprised once more by her appearance. He hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to outshine Natalie in beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always considered Natalie to be the prettiest and had desired her for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she seemed within his reach, he met Daniela,who was even more captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Daniela, Natalie looked like an ordinary countrywoman. Linden entered with the logbook, his thick glasses concealing his greedy gaze. He smiled and assured them, &#34;I&#39;ll be careful in recording Mr. Phillips &#39;reactions to the medications. Although I may not look very neat, I assure you of my precision in my professional duties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept quiet after that. She merely glanced at Linden&#39;s nails. For a doctor, his nails were unusually long, and the dirt beneath them caused her to frown.</p>
