                <p>The night grew darker with every passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was so heavy that even the faintest breath could be heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh eased open the door to his room, moving with deliberate slowness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, he tightened his grip on the fruit knife,his eyes flicking to the wide floor-to-ceiling window left open, letting in a cool breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer curtains swayed lightly in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the pale moonlight, Josh slipped behind them,his steps soundless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had been lurking nearby, waiting for the perfect chance to make his move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, that chance finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets were quiet, and with Josh&#39;s window open,Brad only needed to slip inside and strike once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes burned with vengeance. Tonight, he planned for Josh&#39;s life to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Daniela&#39;s villa, Hamilton stared at her.&#34;Why are you heading out so late?&#34; Daniela laughed while pulling on her sneakers. &#34;I&#39;m just taking a walk with Carol. She wants to grab cake from the corner bakery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton frowned, uneasy. &#34;I&#39;ll come with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol folded her arms. &#34;Two women shopping, and you want to tag along? How will we start up a conversation if we meet handsome guys? If you insist on coming, I&#39;ll flirt with Nikolas and make him marry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pulled Daniela along, tossing a comment over her shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t get in my way of finding a boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two women left the villa and slipped into a car parked at the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Josh&#39;s villa, Brad saw no one around. He scaled the wall carefully, climbing up to the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stood hidden behind the curtains, already alert.His eyes narrowed as the blade in his hand caught the moonlight, gleaming with a cold, sharp edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he heard the faint shuffle of footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s lips curled into a sinister smirk, his grip onthe knife tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s shadow stretched across the floor, clashing with the flickering outline of the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s grin widened as he lifted his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step closer. That was all it would take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blade could then sink into Brad&#39;s body, erasing another rival for the McCoy family&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a low, sinister laugh as the shadow on the floor crept closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed,ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad caught sight of the gleaming knife, but it was already too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized, with a jolt of fear,that Josh had lured him into a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The missing patrols and vanished security were all part of the setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret washed over Brad, but there was no time left.He shut his eyes, bracing for the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a sudden force yanked him backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes snapped open just as the knife sliced through the air where he had stood. A strong grip pulled him away,making him stumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Josh&#39;s voice roared outside, &#34;Guards! Catch him!Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brad could process what had happened,he was shoved into a black car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle spun around and raced out of Josh&#39;s villa,slipping through the gates before they closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad trembled as he glanced back, his thoughts spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Josh&#39;s bodyguards gave chase but were left in the dust, their anger spilling into curses as they stopped at the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s heart pounded as he steadied himself, ready to ask Daniela, &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before a word left his mouth, the car door swung open, and Daniela pushed him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off balance, Brad hit the ground hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car sped away, not once looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring blankly, Brad watched the taillights vanish around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him that he&#39;d been given another chance to bring down Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Carol shook her head. &#34;Why save a fool like him? He&#39;s worthless, falling for such a cheap trap.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was calm. &#34;It amuses me. Everyone stumbles, but Brad will get it right eventually. I have no intention of dirtying my hands with McCoy family matters.&#34; Carol glanced at her through the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her pregnancy, Daniela had carried herself with an almost unshakable calm, as if nothing could ruffle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in that moment, Carol saw flashes of the sharp,commanding leader she had once known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, meanwhile, was seething. Fury drove him straight to Daniela&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he arrived, Daniela had just stepped out of her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, mindful of her condition, drove at a careful pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely set foot on the drveway before Josh&#39;s angry voice cut through the night. &#34;Daniela! What have I done to deserve this? Why are you toying with me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth to reply, but the villa&#39;s door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped out, about to speak, when a dark shadow darted past. Instinctively, he grabbed Daniela&#39;s hand,pulling her a few steps back with him.</p>
