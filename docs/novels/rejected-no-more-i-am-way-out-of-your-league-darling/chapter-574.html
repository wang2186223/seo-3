                <p>Before Daniela could respond, Cedric kicked Elyse without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your dreams! Natalie tried to harm my wife,and now you expect us to help her? Let me make one thing clear-I&#39;ll personally see to it that she never walks free again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stumbled back, eyes wide in shock as she took in Cedric&#39;s seething expression. &#34;It&#39;s over...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed Nina&#39;s hand. &#34;Nina, go beg Daniela!She&#39;s always looked out for you-she&#39;ll listen if you ask. Natalie is your sister! You wouldn&#39;t be so cruel as to turn your back on her, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina yanked her hand away, her voice cold. &#34;Mom,when Natalie had me thrown into that warehouse, did you plead with her the way you&#39;re pleading with me now? Did you even try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s gaze bore into Elyse, demanding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked away, too ashamed to look at her daughter. &#34;I did beg her, but she wouldn&#39;t listen.You&#39;ve always done what I asked, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina scoffed, her laugh sharp and bitter. &#34;So because | was obedient, I should just accept everything without question? Mom, Natalie committed murder! She took a life-she has to answer for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words left her mouth, the police arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They dragged Natalie away, with Cedric close behind, accompanied by a lawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse slumped into a corner, trembling. Natalie thrashed against her restraints, her voice ringing with venom as she screamed, &#34;Daniela, you just wait! I&#39;ll come back! I&#39;ll come back and kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That threat left Cedric on high alert. From the day Natalie was locked up to the final court ruling, Cedric was present at every stage, ensuring justice was served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after the verdict was sealed that Cedric finally exhaled, releasing the breath he hadn&#39;t realized he was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,however,remained composed throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, even thinking about it now gives me chills,&#34;Cedric admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a small, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But seriously, how did you dodge like that? It was incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Did it look that cool?&#34; Daniela teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! I even tried to recreate it a few times after, but | couldn&#39;t pull it off!&#34; Cedric confessed, stil baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;In moments of crisis,the body releases adrenaline, triggering instinctive reactions. It&#39;s a natural response.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noddled, taking her explanation at face value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Natalie out of the picture, Elyse suddenly turned her attention to Nina, showering her with an almost suffocating amount of affection on set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To outsiders, she seemed like the perfect, doting mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina knew better. Natalie was gone, and Elyse could only rely on her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina,&#34; Elyse cooed, setting a glass of water in front of her. &#34;Don&#39;t you find it inconvenient living at Daniela&#39;s? You&#39;re a rising star now-you have fans watching you. Staying at her place isn&#39;t ideal.Why don&#39;t you ask Daniela to let you move into our old villa instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s gaze remained cold, unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse pressed on, her tone sickeningly sweet.&#34;Daniela was going to give that house to Natalie anyway.What difference does it make if you take it instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina didn&#39;t even need to think twice. &#34;It&#39;s you who wants to move into the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out an awkward chuckle. &#34;Sweetheart, I just worry about you living alone. And let&#39;s be honest,this isn&#39;t even your place. Daniela may not say anything, but Cedric? Over time, he&#39;s bound to mind.And Lillian? You know how difficult she can be.Wouldn&#39;t you be better off somewhere else? Come live with me, and I&#39;ll take care of you. You&#39;ve always said I played favorites, but this is my chance to make it up to you, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a sharp scoff, &#34;So, Mom, your idea of making it up to me only works in a big house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse frowned slightly, still not used to being patient with Nina.</p>
