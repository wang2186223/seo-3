                <p>Lucian Chavez, the finance director at Elite Lux,queried, &#34;Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bradley, are you implying that for this partnership, we should treat all construction expenses as charitable donations?Could such a generous arrangement really exist? Is that your final decision? To forfeit hundreds of billions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twisted rationale of the elite left him utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler, the legal counsel, also gazed at Cedric, his expression one of bewildered curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From its inception, Cedric had been a key investor in the company, holding the reins over Elite LuX&#39;s ventures. His leadership had recently culminated in a windfall of profits for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite attempts to understand his strategies, they remained a mystery to many, including Tyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the accountant at Tyler&#39;sfirm scrutinized the expenses reflected in their ledger, a series of zeroes stretched before him like a road to ruin, ushering in a throbbing headache. Could this deal drive the company into bankruptcy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s finance team had initially been confident in their ability to negotiate the terms of the agreement. Yet, they found themselves at a loss, as the opposing party disregarded the usual protocols.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you actually forfeiting tens of billions in project funds?&#34; Lucian massaged his temples, trying to find clarity in the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler glanced at Cedric for confirmation, receiving a nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirroring the gesture, Tyler also nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of thrill crossed Lucian&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were set to rake in tens of billions, and no catch whatsoever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then are there any stipulations? Perhaps terms for future partnerships with Elite Lux?&#34; he suggested tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, there won&#39;t be any future collaborations!&#34;Cedric&#39;s tone was firm, leaving no room for  argument. Lucian was utterly bewildered, unsure of how to respond. He couldn&#39;t hold back and questioned,&#34;What exactly are you trying to get?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler, equally baffled, turned to Cedric and echoed,&#34;What do you even want from this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head, brushing off any argument.&#34;There&#39;s no point explaining. Just sign the settlement and be done with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene unfolded with a surreal air that made Lucian tread carefully. &#34;Hold on, let me get in touch with our boss,&#34; he announced before stepping away momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was in a meeting, pressing down on the documents on the table. Lucian returned with the phone and gave it to Cedric. Daniela asked in exasperation, &#34;Cedric, what are you up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;Like I mentioned yesterday, I&#39;m engaged in charity work.&#34; Daniela sighed, a flicker of frustration crossing her face. &#34;We do not entertain charitable sponsorships here. Please, pass the phone to someone from our finance team.&#34; Complying without a word, Cedric handed over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela&#39;s brief exchange, the line went dead,and Lucian&#39;s expression morphed into one of sheer confusion. &#34;Our boss just crunched some numbers and based on our market profit share, your net gain from this transaction would be around 10.3 billion.We&#39;ve decided to round it up to 11 billion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could respond, Tyler&#39;s accountant leaped to his feet, equally stunned. &#34;Excuse me? Did I hear that right? From 10.3 to 11 billion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion to bump the figure by a staggering 700 million sparked disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That decision defied all logic!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it Cedric or Daniela who deemed math meaningless in the world of extreme wealth?</p>
