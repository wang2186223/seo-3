                <p>As they approached their meeting with the CEO of Elite Lux, Joyce was bursting with excitement, eagerly sharing every bit of insider information she had gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The CEO of Elite Lux is a prodigy! By his teens, he was spearheading a team of young virtuosos, making a splash on the global stage. Against all odds, he turned a simple sketch into a sensational overnight success. He didn&#39;t just stop there. After banking his initial millions, he rapidly scaled up his operations. Now,he stands as the wealthiest individual globally.Despite his wealth, he&#39;s known for being down-to-earth and extraordinarily sharp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face was alight with admiration, her gaze locked onto an approaching stretch Lincoln, its rarity underscored by its sleek lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nudged Alexander enthusiastically, barely containing her glee. &#34;Look, Alexander! There&#39;s the car!It must be him-the CEO of Elite Lux!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the car glided to a halt in front of Luxor Tower. As Lillian emerged first, the anticipation hung  heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the rear door opened slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes widened in suspense, her breath caught in her throat, ready to finally lay eyes on the fabled,dashing CEO of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the blink of an eye, her thrill morphed into sheer astonishment. Her mouth hung open, agape, as seconds stretched into what seemed like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Joyce&#39;s voice pierced the silence, high-pitched and incredulous. &#34;What the hell are you doing here? And in the CEO of Elite Lux&#39;s car,no less?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she scrutinized Daniela&#39;s impeccable appearance, her mind racing to piece together the scene before her. In a scornful tone dripping with malice, she hissed, &#34;After leaving the Harper family and being dumped by Alexander, you seduced the CEO of Elite Lux, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s gaze burned with loathing and scorn as she stared at Daniela. &#34;Have you no shred of dignity left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Joyce was the last thing Daniela expected upon her return. What back luck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinded by jealousy, Joyce dashed towards the vehicle,peering inside with eager, searching eyes. Where was the CEO of Elite Lux? She would unveil Daniela&#39;s true  nature to the CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s divorce was still recent, but somehow she&#39;d already landed herself a sugar daddy. The notion was unacceptable to Joyce. She couldn&#39;t stand idly by and watch this unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frantically, Joyce scoured the vehicle, but it was utterly empty-no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed Joyce&#39;s wild gestures with evident disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Joyce jabbed a finger in Daniela, her voice sharp and accusing. &#34;Where&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux?Where did you hide him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela summoned the security. &#34;There&#39;s a delusional woman here causing a scene. Could you kindly take care of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the building manager hurried over with a broad smile. &#34;Hello, Ms. Harper. Mr. Phillips had planned to greet you himself today, but he&#39;s been delayed due to his car breaking down. He should be here shortly. He&#39;s instructed us to extend every courtesy to you. The renovations on the upper floors,tailored to your specifications, are well underway.Furthermore, in response to your request, we&#39;ve initiated the renaming of the Luxor Tower. The new signage is on the way and will be installed by this evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a nod of appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the way, the manager ushered Daniela through the grand entrance of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused briefly, turning to address the security team.&#34;Stay vigilant at the doors. We are not to admit anyone without proper clearance. Remember, Ms.Harper is not only our esteemed guest but the new proprietor of this establishment. Should she express any dissatisfaction, prepare to vacate your positions immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guards responded with quick, solemn nods, underscoring the gravity of the manager&#39;s directives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and the manager continued into the heart of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Alexander and Joyce remained momentarily paralyzed by the unfolding events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Joyce several moments to find her voice as the newly minted sign arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With &#34;Harper&#34; prominently displayed, replacing the old name on the iconic Olisvine landmark, her astonishment was palpable. Turning to Alexander, Joyce exclaimed, &#34;Alexander,did you catch that? Daniela has not only secured ties with the CEO of Elite Lux but has convinced him to rename an entire building in her honor! It seems she has thoroughly enchanted the CEO!&#34;</p>
