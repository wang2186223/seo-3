                <p>It had been many years since anyone had dared to speak to Hackett in such a manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Brylee would have been bold enough to speak to him like this in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett fought to hide the flush creeping up his neck.He briefly shut his eyes, inhaled deeply, and then forced a tight smile at the corners of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper,&#34; Hackett said with a faint smile, trying to project generosity, though the anger simmering in his eyes was barely concealed. &#34;You really should keep your subordinates under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett turned his steely gaze to Daniela, &#34;Ms. Harper,with such an expansive business,it would be quite the scandal if people learned you couldn&#39;t even manage your own team properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a cold, humorless laugh before tilting his head slightly, locking eyes with Cedric, his tone now laced with respect. &#34;Right,Mr.Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was clearly attempting to impress Cedric, putting on an act. Daniela let out a sharp snort of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric joined in the laughter, and for reasons he couldn&#39;t pinpoint, Hackett felt an unexpected twinge of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cedric said, &#34;Lillian is family. We can&#39;t treat her as an outsider. What&#39;s the matter, Mr. Graves? Do you have an issue with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face drained of color at the words. He had clearly made a blunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. I thought she was just a secretary. How thoughtless of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a quiet sigh of relief, quickly glancing over at Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood with her arms crossed, her expression aloof and indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a rough start, Hackett leaned in,lowering his voice. &#34;May I have a word? There&#39;s a small matter I&#39;d like to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at Daniela, who gave a small,knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rose to his feet, with Hackett quickly following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a seat a few paces away from Daniela.  Hackett settled into the chair next to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett forced a smile. &#34;Everyone knows how deeply you cherish your wife. And I could see it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett pressed on, &#34;However, I believe your wife is a bit too ruthless. In business, we should greet people with warmth to ensure success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric arched an eyebrow, his expression still cool. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett opened his mouth to respond when Cedric casually added, &#34;Are you implying that your.family&#39;s success is thanks to your wife winning favor from others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face stiffened at the words, his expression locking in place. After all, no one dared speak to the president of the commerce association in such a manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face remained rigid for a long moment before he clenched his teeth and said, &#34;Mr. Phillips,you must be joking. I was simply offering some advice.Maintaining a balanced relationship is essential. I&#39;ve heard your wife was your first love, so it&#39;s natural for you to be so protective of her. But if you focus too much on your wife, your standing at home will suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In love, it&#39;s vital to maintain the upper hand.&#34; Cedric&#39;s gaze grew cold, his eyes locking onto Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face took on a smug grin. &#34;There are three tricks to dealing with women. Would you like to hear them? First, don&#39;t spoil them too much, but don&#39;t ignore them either. Treat them like a cat-tease them when you&#39;re interested, and give them space when you&#39;re not. Second, don&#39;t give them too much power.Otherwise, they&#39;ll start thinking they&#39;re someone important, and it will be harder to put them in their place. Third, don&#39;t shower them with too much money or let them flaunt themselves in public. Keep them like a bird in a cage, dependent on you. This way,they&#39;ll always rely on you, a puppet in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each word, Cedric&#39;s expression grew icier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett had often shared these thoughts with others,and as the president of the association, he was accustomed to flattery. He felt a sense of satisfaction sharing his &#34;insights&#34; with Cedric, believing it might bring him closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business and women were always the best topics to bond over. A couple of drinks and men would treat each other like old friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graves,&#34; Cedric called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett smiled, responding, &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I remember correctly, you started your career in the entertainment industry, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett,slightly puzzled,replied,&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I recall your female artists often play roles as independent, strong, and dignified women. So, in your view, are women just meant to depend on men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett chuckled. &#34;That&#39;s just a marketing strategy.Women today love that image, don&#39;t they? They seem independent and strong, but deep down, they&#39;re still fragile and need support. We just give the market what it wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s film company had produced many female-led blockbusters,each a hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one expected that beneath the facade of championing female independence, Hackett actually held women in contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, you&#39;re just too devoted. We should talk more about these matters in the future. You&#39;ll see how enjoyable it can be.&#34; Hackett grinned at Cedric. &#34;I wonder if you&#39;d be interested in visiting my home. My three daughters just returned from studying abroad and are at home. They all admire you greatly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Hackett&#39;s sycophantic grin, his stomach turning with disgust. &#34;Is that so?&#34; &#34;Mr.Graves, you really go all out for business. Don&#39;t forget, I&#39;m a married man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett chuckled. &#34;That&#39;s why I think you&#39;re too attached. Only those with little would rely on marriage to secure their lifestyle. What&#39;s its true value, other than polishing your public image?&#39; For men, pleasure is what really matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett left with a smug grin, handing Cedric a note with his home address before exiting. &#34;I&#39;ll be waiting for you at my home,Mr. Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Hackett left, his smile widening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric was about to toss the note into the trash, Daniela stepped forward and stopped him.</p>
