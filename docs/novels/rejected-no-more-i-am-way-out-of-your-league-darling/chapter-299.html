                <p>Caiden believed it was all Daniela&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she just played along, his public humiliation could have been avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five hundred a month? That sum wouldn&#39;t even begin to cover his tips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Caiden made his way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving, he found Daniela deeply engrossed in a video game she&#39;d recently developed, sprawled comfortably on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached her aggressively, questioning,&#34;Daniela, what do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric appeared, stepping out of a bedroom, a towel draped around him.  Caiden glared at Daniela. &#34;Do you even understand how embarrassing today was for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of the specifics, Daniela could only assume that Caiden had failed another of his schemes.&#34;Maybe you wouldn&#39;t feel so embarrassed if you stopped making baseless claims.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply only fueled Caiden&#39;s anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! I am your father! Does my disgrace mean nothing to you? Does it please you to see me degraded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m honestly glad for my mom. Being with you had only brought her pain,&#34; Daniela responded with a laugh, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt like he was about to burst with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric prepared to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a piercing stare, Daniela confronted Caiden.&#34;If she were still here, Caiden, do you think she would regret her marriage to such a fool?&#34;  In a fit of anger, Caiden raised his hand, ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose to her feet, her eyes piercing Caiden with cold intensity. &#34;Do you truly believe that my mother took her own life out of mere despair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Caiden froze, struck by a grim realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela moved closer, he backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been haunting my dreams, telling me about the pain of her fall. She talks about her bones breaking, her blood spilling, and how peace never came. And yet, you call yourself my father, her husband? Did it ever cross your mind that it might not have been just an accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, Caiden sank into the couch. His face turned pale. &#34;I don&#39;t know anything,&#34; he stammered,then raced up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His nerves had wiped the initial argument clean from his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, with a defeated slouch, Caiden stood at  Cedric&#39;s door and said, &#34;I&#39;m heading back to Zentara.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the large window and mid-call, Cedric paused to say, &#34;We&#39;ll leave it here for now,&#34; to the person on the line before turning to Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever happened back then didn&#39;t involve me.I&#39;m clueless about it, and I&#39;m intent on returning to Zentara.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim ambiance of the room, only a sliver of light cast shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s silhouette was just visible to Caiden, who couldn&#39;t make out his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really believe you&#39;re innocent? Aren&#39;t you the one who claimed Daniela as your daughter and Brylee as your wife? And now you say it&#39;s none of your concern?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared within Caiden. &#34;Brylee is gone! I&#39;ve cut ties with Daniela! If they want revenge, that&#39;s up to them. There&#39;s nothing I can do. I need to leave for Zentara now, Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice turned cold as he looked up. &#34;They don&#39;t care about me anymore, and I&#39;m no use to them.I need to leave. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had always detested the tough life in Zentara.He used to constantly dream of returning. Yet now,he was anxious to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, however, simply said, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden looked up sharply. &#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you instigated all this chaos. You were unfaithful, giving Katrina the opening she needed to disrupt your marriage, and it was Brylee who suffered. You robbed Daniela of a happy childhood.You failed as a husband and as a father. This blame is on you. There&#39;s no escape this time. You can&#39;t just run away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hushed room, Cedric&#39;s voice cut through the silence, resolute and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s initial agitation dissolved under the weight  of Cedric&#39;s accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by despair, Caiden collapsed to the floor, clutching his head. His voice broke as he murmured, &#34;It&#39;s not my fault. I didn&#39;t do this. It&#39;s all their doing.&#34;</p>
