                <p>Long after midnight, Hamilton strolled into the hospital where Arthur was recovering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur couldn&#39;t stop shaking,still haunted by what he&#39;d been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed grace, Hamilton settled into the chair opposite of Arthur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Hamilton&#39;s secretary stepped forward, handing Arthur a sheet of paper and a check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you sketched something the first time you laid eyes on Daniela,&#34; Hamilton said smoothly. &#34;If youcan recreate that drawing right now, the check is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur shrank into his blanket, terror flashing in his éyes. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Presented with a choice, cash or life, the answer was clear. He wasn&#39;t about to risk his life for any amount of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would never forget how Daniela&#39;s blade found its mark over and over, every slice sharp and deliberate while he was wide awake. That kind of pain was something he never wanted to relive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton observed Arthur&#39;s panic, a chilling grin stretching across his face, his gleaming false teeth on display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the deal-give me what I want, and you walk away with the money and a one-way ticket overseas.Refuse, and I&#39;ll toss you in with my crocodiles. Care to guess how long you&#39;d last before you black out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the threat lingered in the air, Hamilton&#39;s secretary pulled out a phone and played a clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A video began, on screen, crocodiles lunged at the camera, jaws snapping open wide, as if they could leap out at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it! Just don&#39;t hurt me!&#34; Arthur said, his whole body trembling as he hurried to scatter black dots across the sheet of paper. &#34;What do these black dots represent?&#34; Hamilton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur gulped and replied, &#34;Each one points to a particular characteristic, or maybe a vulnerability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton pressed further. &#34;And what are her weaknesses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not skilled enough to be sure. But from what I can make out, Daniela&#39;s weak spot has something to do with her mother&#39;s death. Your son, Damon, spent years training under Dr. Denton Guzman, the famous psychologist. If you give him this page, he&#39;ll know how to decode it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a frustrated sigh. &#34;Absolutely useless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, he stood up and pulled out his phone, dialing Damon&#39;s number immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like the truth was just barely out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Damon noticed the incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as he was about to pick up, Cedric grabbed him by the arm and pulled him aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shot Cedric a confused look. &#34;What&#39;s going on? My father&#39;s calling me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught a glimpse of Damon&#39;s phone screen and nodded. &#34;Yeah, I saw who&#39;s calling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon paused before speaking. &#34;If I don&#39;t pick up, my dad totally loses it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to bring the phone up to his ear, but Cedric stepped in and blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shot Cedric a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you tell that Daniela is afraid of blood?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shrugged. &#34;Yes. My mentor is an internationally recognized psychologist. He taught me a few tricks most people can&#39;t pull off. Reading things like that? For me, it&#39;s almost second nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he didn&#39;t care about much, Damon had a real talent for odd skills like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, Cedric leaned in. &#34;Do you know anything about Arthur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon smirked. &#34;He&#39;s a nobody. Goes around pretending to be my teacher&#39;s student, but in reality,he just picked up some scraps and uses my teacher&#39;s reputation to scam people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what could he actually figure out from that chart?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon scoffed, &#34;Not a chance he&#39;d spot her fear of blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, he understood the source of Cedric&#39;s concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wicked laugh, Damon teased, &#34;Let me guess. You&#39;re worried my father might discover Daniela&#39;s weakness and use it against her, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression hardened, shadows crossing his face as his eyes narrowed dangerously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon continued, &#34;The only people who can really decode that thing are my teacher and I. Cedric, are you about to beg me to keep this secret from my dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a dry chuckle and slipped his hand into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deliberate step closer to Damon. &#34;You want me to beg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers brushed the handle of a fruit knife, sharp enough to end this conversation in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How exactly do you want me to beg?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice dropped lower, tension building in his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me stay here for good. That&#39;s my price. If you agree, I&#39;ll keep this secret for a lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at him, caught off guard. &#34;You&#39;re serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. I like it here,&#34; Damon replied, grinning. &#34;I get to hang around my idol, and your cooking actually reminds me of home. Give me a permanent room, and your secret is safe with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked, surprised by the simplicity of Damon&#39;s request. &#34;That&#39;s it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all I want,&#34; Damon answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric finally let go of the knife and nodded. &#34;Fine. You&#39;ve got yourself a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Totally unaware of how close he&#39;d come to danger, Damon turned away to take his father&#39;s call. Meanwhile, Daniela lingered in the doorway, amusement dancing in her eyes as he gazed at Cedric.&#34;See?|told you-he&#39;s not that complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;That doesn&#39;t make me feel any better.&#34; Deep down, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that only the dead could keep a secret.</p>
