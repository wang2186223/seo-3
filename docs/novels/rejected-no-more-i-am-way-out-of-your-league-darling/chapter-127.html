                <p>Ryan and Lillian observed Alexander&#39;s emotions surge and plummet dramatically, much like a rollercoaster-an amusing spectacle to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed deeply, his face etched with a somber expression as he trailed behind Daniela into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he maintained a stoic exterior, the storm raging within him mirrored Alexander&#39;s own distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been aware beforehand, he would have steered clear of any involvement with Elite Lux&#39;s ventures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of being a stay-at-home husband, once a concept he dismissed with a scoff, now seemed an unattainable dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath to ease the constriction in his chest, Cedric felt a mixture of frustration and despair after dropping Daniela off at her house. As she began to close the door, Cedric placed his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hand against it, halting its movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed at Cedric, her expression filled with bewilderment. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric implored, &#34;Daniela, listen-| was involved in the North District project, but I&#39;m not the legal representative. I&#39;m not profiting from it. To date, I haven&#39;t received a dime. We&#39;re doingthis as a pro bono endeavor, purely out of goodwill. Is that something you can accept?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, taken aback. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you that the profits would be calculated and distributed to everyone eventually?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s not it at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Daniela&#39;s face clouded with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s purely a pro bono endeavor. Honestly, we&#39;re not after any profit at all! And the project in the South and East Districts? It&#39;s entirely for charity too! Our company aims to bolster its image by engaging in these community service projects. Let&#39;s make this clear; please, linsist,no money!&#34; Cedric walked away, a throbbing headache beginning to form. Phillips Group was rolling in wealth. How on earth was he meant to spend all this cash? And if he handed it all over to Daniela, would she even take it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slid open, Lillian and Ryan emerged. Cedric fixed them with a grave look and ventured, &#34;Do you reckon if I offered Daniela Phillips Group, myself included as part of the package, she&#39;d take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s brows furrowed as she squinted slightly.&#34;Wait, what did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan shook his head. &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure her advice is to get your head checked first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric found himself at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, the North District project transitioned into its concluding settlement phase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance teams from both corporations exchanged looks of bewildered resignation. &lt;</p>
