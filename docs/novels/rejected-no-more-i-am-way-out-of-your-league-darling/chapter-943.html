                <p>Josh&#39;s brow knitted in frustration. &#34;Get someone to purify the air in this place and wipe away that jasmine smell. I don&#39;t want it lingering.&#34; From across the room, Mason, still recovering at home, looked up in surprise. &#34;Is that really necessary? The poisonous jasmines were over on Daniela&#39;s side, not ours. Are we seriously hiring someone just to purify the air?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of harsh cleaning chemicals made Masón wrinkle his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with the objections. Just do it!&#34; Josh&#39;s suspicion was obvious as he barked the order. &#34;I want it handled right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Josh paid a visit to McCoy Group,lining up a meeting with their most important business partner to talk about future cooperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in the middle of negotiations, he called home to check in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason picked up, sounding harried. &#34;We&#39;re on it,Dad. Can&#39;t you hear the machine rumbling in the background? The place smells like chemicals now. I can barely breathe in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nodded, satisfied, and turned his attention back to the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat at home when Carol approached with news. &#34;McCoy Group&#39;s biggest partner is meeting with Josh. If Josh manages to win them over,McCoy Group will lose half its power. Daniela, shouldn&#39;t you do something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s worry was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While McCoy Group boasted impressive strength, its organization was straightforward. Their leading partner held half of their business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Daniela showed no sign of worry. She offered Carol a cool, reassuring smile. &#34;We still have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Daniela&#39;s gaze drifted to the kitchen,where Hamilton was bickering with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was firm.11Apregnant woman needs proper nutrition. Chicken soup is a must! If you make it so tasteless, how is the baby supposed to get anything from it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained composed. &#34;A heavy, greasy meal isn&#39;t good for her cholesterol. It&#39;s not healthy for the baby,either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot back, &#34;That&#39;s nonsense! I&#39;ve raised a whole brood of kids, and none of them ever had cholesterol problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric just shrugged. &#34;Maybe so, but you&#39;re in my kitchen now. My rules apply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s resistance left Hamilton fuming, so he turned around and went looking for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton called out, &#34;Are you just going to stand there and let Cedric do as he pleases?&#34; Daniela met Hamilton&#39;s flushed, indignant glare.&#34;Arguing over soup is a minor issue. There are much bigger matters that demand your attention, ones you seem to be missing entirely. Have you thought about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked skeptical. &#34;You&#39;re just taking Cedric&#39;s side. What could possibly be more important than my own grandchild?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was steady. &#34;There are much bigger concerns. For one, let&#39;s not even argue about whether this baby belongs to the McCoy family.Think about what would happen if you ended up with nothing at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a derisive laugh. &#34;Me?. With nothing?Please. I&#39;m Hamilton McCoy, and poverty has never touched me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply right away. Instead, she adjusted her laptop and turned the screen his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get your hands on the latest McCoy Group financials?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s eyes widened. On a second monitor, a live feed showed McCoy Group&#39;s largest business partner arriving at the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;Isn&#39;t that Maximo Wagner? Wasn&#39;t he out of the country? Why is he suddenly showing up at McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tapped a finger against the spreadsheet.&#34;Take a look. Do you notice anything unusual?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension that had filled Hamilton just moments earlier drained away as he took a seat and leaned in,scanning the rows of numbers on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These documents were supposed to land in his inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had never truly doubted McCoy Group&#39;s stability or Josh&#39;s loyalty. But now, to his surprise, he saw a glaring red flag in an area he&#39;d never thought to check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of business acumen kicked in, and Hamilton instantly knew something was very wrong. Stripping off his apron, he muttered under his breath,&#34;I&#39;d better see to this myself. If McCoy Group goes down,there won&#39;t be anything left for my grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive over to McCoy Group, Hamilton dialed a few members of the McCoy family for backup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad answered first. &#34;Maximo&#39;s back? HHe&#39;s at McCoy Group? Everything must be legit then, right? Wait,you&#39;re saying the numbers are off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, &#34;I was just wondering about those weird figures. None of the reports made sense.The shift is dramatic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan was more cautious. &#34;Should we maybe wait until Maximo leaves before bringing this up to Josh?It might put him in an awkward spot if we question him in front of outsiders. Really, though, Josh wouldn&#39;t do anything shady, we&#39;re family. Let&#39;s just hold tight for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others seemed content with that plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, though, felt the weight of looming disaster. &#34;If we delay any longer, McCoy Group will go bankrupt.&#34;</p>
