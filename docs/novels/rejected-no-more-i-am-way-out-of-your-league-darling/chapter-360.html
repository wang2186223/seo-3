                <p>&#34;Would you like something to drink? Can I get you anything?&#34; Nina&#39;s voice floated gently, imbued with a light smile,seemingly innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at her and replied briefly,thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Nina kept up with him, her smile steady. &#34;Maybe you&#39;re not a fan of coffee? I&#39;m really good at making fresh juice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Cedric heard this, his expression slowly hardened. &#34;Nina Dury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes sparkled with anticipation as she fixed her gaze on Cedric, responding promptly,here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression showed a hint of annoyance. &#34;Remember, you were employed by Elite Lux, not Phillips Group. Your duties are to Daniela, not to me. Focus on her needs instead of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s smile abruptly stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then glanced at Lillian, who seemed to be enjoying the exchange with a hint of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you please take your colleague away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric turned and entered Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lip, her eyes welling up with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out a quiet laugh.&#34;Well, I&#39;m up for either coffee or juice. Mind making one for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, Nina nodded and walked towards the pantry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the office, Cedric found Daniela was not there but in a meeting. The previous night, he had acquired a splendid sapphire jewelry piece at an auction. Intending to surprise Daniela, he was about to place it in her lounge when the door to the meeting room swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking back, Cedric assumed it was Lillian. &#34;Keep an eye on your team members. Ensure they don&#39;t get ideas above their station.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making his point, Cedric retrieved the jewelry from its bag and set it on the lounge table, opening the box to inspect it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood behind him, holding a freshly brewved cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she glanced over, her eyes landed on the jewelry, which radiated a captivating green shimmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This piece was said to have been part of an ancient queen&#39;s dowry to her daughter, an item of immense value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many collectors had contested aggressively for it the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, a mysterious affluent buyer acquired the jewelry, leaving behind a note that read,′′Apriceless jewel for a beloved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at Cedric, her expression one of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors had circulated about Cedric&#39;s infatuation with Daniela, but could he truly justify spending billions on a piece of jewelry just to win her over?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s generosity seemed boundless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nina watched him, her heart pounded with intensity, captivated by Cedric&#39;s profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought such a man truly deserved the finest partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of admiration and yearning filled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing they were alone in the office, Nina approached Cedric and&#34;accidentally&#34; tilted her coffee cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coffee stained Cedric&#39;s immaculate white shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedricturned, expecting Lillian, but instead, he met Nina&#39;s apologetic gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared flustered, rapidly grabbing tissues. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Cedric. I didn&#39;t mean to. This was clumsy of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While apologizing, she reached out with a tissue towards Cedric&#39;s midsection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, instinctively stepping back. He was about to respond when the office door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian entered, mid-conversation. &#34;Daniela, about Nina...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted abruptly upon seeing the scene in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela entered behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize, Daniela. This was my mistake. Please don&#39;t misinterpret what happened,&#34; Nina pleaded,her voice tinged with distress as she bit her lip.</p>
