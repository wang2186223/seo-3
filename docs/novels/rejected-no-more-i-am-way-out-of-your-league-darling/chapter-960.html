            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Cold resentment flashed in Ethan&#39;s eyes as he glared at Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he ripped out the IV from his arm,tossed the blanket aside, and bolted from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left staring at the open doorway, Josh scowled and spat on the floor in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton&#39;s car rolled up to Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Ethan arrived in a rush, heading straight for Hamilton and Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to invest in Daniela&#39;s team too,&#34; he announced without preamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep crease formed between Hamilton&#39;s brows &#34;Didn&#39;t you just lose everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stung. Ethan nearly coughed from indignation.&#34;Easy for you to say, Hamilton! All you ever care about is money. Josh took me for a fool, and instead of helping me, you just stand there rubbing salt in my wounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moisture threatened to spill from Ethan&#39;s eyes. A sigh escaped Brad as he shook his head. &#34;Ethan, I tried to warn you about Josh, but you wouldn&#39;t listen.Now you&#39;ve got nothing left, and Hamilton&#39;s hands are tied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with the lectures, Brad! Hamilton, are you going to help or not?&#34; Ethan snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the old days, Hamilton would have stepped in without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d always honored their father&#39;s wish to look after the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years passed under his steady guidance, and the family flourished, everyone growing used to relying on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot offer you any assistance,&#34; said Hamilton,his tone carrying a firmness that left no room for doubt.&#34;If everything had gone the way it was supposed to,McCoy Group should belong to my future grandson.Yet you chose to disregard the ties that once bound us, tearing apart the strength that made McCoy Group formidable. From that point on, I came to see that each person walks their own road. You decided to stand by Josh, and now you must accept the consequences of that choice. I have stepped down,and there is no strength left in me to give. I need to focus on staying healthy so I can care for my grandkids. That is the end of it.&#34;With those words, Hamilton strode into the villa and didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long after,Ethan stood frozen in place, the weight of everything finally sinking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We made our mistakes from the very start, Ethan.Hamilton kept McCoy Group running all these years,and when the shares were tallied, Daniela made sure the company&#39;s wealth was included-none of that would have existed without Hamilton. He could have resented us for it, but he never did. The truth is,we never gave him the credit he deserved.&#34; A heavy sigh escaped Brad as regret weighed on his words. &#34;You put everything you had in Josh&#39;s hands, and now you&#39;re stuck with the outcome.That&#39;s the reality,even if we&#39;re family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real brotherhood would have stopped Josh from bleeding Ethan dry. Real family would have meant that Ethan&#39;s money was returned, no questions asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stability had defined the McCoy family for years,with nothing ever truly shaking them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that real hardship had struck, everyone&#39;s true character came to light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brad turned away, Ethan suddenly charged straight into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lounged in the living room, drink in hand and content. The sight of Ethan storming in, anger etched across his face, caught him off guard, he nearly spilled his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan demanded, &#34;Bring Daniela here. I need to see her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An edge crept into Hamilton&#39;s tone as he snapped,&#34;You&#39;re crossing the line, Ethan. This isn&#39;t your house,and Daniela&#39;s expecting. If you have a problem,you come to me. Leave Daniela out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t back down. I need to see her,&#34; Ethan insisted,his voice growing louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad followed close behind, his brow furrowed in concern. &#34;Ethan, listen to reason. Daniela is upstairs,resting. She&#39;s carrying twins. Father always said that no harm should come to a McCoy child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad said that not just because Daniela had been generous with the shares, but also because she was a good person. He genuinely hoped the McCoy family would thrive again. He no longer wanted to see the family fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held a firm conviction that Daniela possessed the ability to bring that vision into reality. She was worth protecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ethan refused to be moved. He dropped to the floor right there, stubborn as ever. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere until I see Daniela. You can&#39;t force me out.&#34;</p>
