                <p>The atmosphere thickened with tension, becoming almost suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding host peered around the sparsely populated hall, paused uncertainly, and then whispered tentatively, &#34;Should we go on with the ceremony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard reached his limit. Rising abruptly, he snatched his coat and bolted out, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander surveyed the few stricken faces of the Harper family with a cold, dismissive stare. With a scornful chuckle, he declared, &#34;Well, if it comes to it,we&#39;ll just sign the divorce papers right after the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for their response before turning on his heel and walking away. Joyce felt a pang of despair as she watched Alexander&#39;s back receding. Overcome with urgency,she dashed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the echoing expanse of the banquet hall, only Caiden and Katrina were left standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, the hotel manager approached them with a courteous smile, presenting a bill.&#34;Would you like to settle this with cash or a card? Also,please note the wine spill earlier has ruined a carpet valued at ten-thousand dollars, which we&#39;ve added to your total bill. The charge for today&#39;s event amounts to four million dollars. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amount struck Caiden like a punch he never saw coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was left with no option but to cobble together the last of the wedding gifts&#39; money. Pleading for any reduction, he barely managed to clear the exorbitant fee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching at nothing, Caiden stumbled from the hotel,emerging into the clamor of the city street. He stood,momentarily adrift in the ceaseless tide of passersby, his thoughts a chaotic whirl. How had his life unraveled to this point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been a beacon of kindness-the most compassionate person he knew, always protective and quick to forgive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had it come to this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux, was his own flesh and blood. If he had shown her the slightest kindness,she would never have cast him aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he was her only remaining family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fact alone should have guaranteed him a life filled with comfort and luxury during his twilight years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,what had driven them apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had caused the deep rift between him and Daniela,as well as Brylee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had he let everything fall apart so disastrously? Lost in his regrets, Caiden wandered down the street,oblivious to the chaos around him until the screech of brakes shattered his reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body was hurled through the air, tumbling, before it slammed down onto the hard asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying there, his vision dimming and pain coursing through his body, a quiet thought fluttered across his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really messed up this badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela received a call from the hospital, pressing her to settle some medical expenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon asking for the patient&#39;s name, the person on the other end hesitated, their words faltering without a clear answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Daniela. Without a word, she ended the call and chose not to visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Joyce stormed into the room, her expression clouded with anger. &#34;Dad, what&#39;s the matter with you? You&#39;re not a child anymore! Can&#39;t you watch where you&#39;re walking? I&#39;ve just started a new Chapter in my life with my marriage, and here l am, rushing to the hospital because of your carelessness. Are you trying to sabotage my happiness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, upon hearing Joyce&#39;s sharp rebuke, felt her words sting more painfully than his physical injuries.&#34;Joyce, I kneeled and begged Daniela on your behalf.I pushed myself to the edge for you. I was worn out,and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t see the car. And now you dare say that to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice cut through the air, sharp and chilling.&#34;So you kneeled before Daniela? Look, you&#39;ve secured the shares, right? If a single act of submission can bring us that much gain, I&#39;d kneel every single day. Really, you&#39;re okay now, so what&#39;s the urgency in dragging me here? Dad, I&#39;m a married woman now. You shouldn&#39;t keep burdening me with these issues. It&#39;s wearing me down. If you can&#39;t manage your own medical bills and expect me to pay for them, have you considered how much strain that puts on my relationship with my husband and father- in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze locked on her, his expression one of utter shock. &#34;What did you just say?&#34; His voice was feeble,trembling with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it clear enough? Do you think it&#39;s right to keep leaning on your married daughter like this? And don&#39;t forget-I&#39;m not even your flesh and blood. If you&#39;re in need, you should reach out to Daniela. She&#39;s your real daughter. Consider my predicament for once. My husband and father-in-law are already displeased with me, and your demands are only making my life more difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few quick taps, Joyce transferred just enough money into his account to settle the hospital bills.She offered no comforting words, no inquiries about his well-being. Without another word, she turned and left the room,leaving Caiden to sink back against his pillow, his figure deflated, motionless as a statue.</p>
