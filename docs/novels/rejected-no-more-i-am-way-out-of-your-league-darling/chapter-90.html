                <p>Caiden&#39;s life had flipped upside down in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he sat down with a grave expression,mulling over the stark contrasts between Daniela and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts consumed him so deeply that he failed to notice the Bennett family&#39;s car rolling through the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when Katrina&#39;s voice echoed in the garden that Caiden snapped out of his reverie, rising from his chair with a start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he made his way into the house,memories of the day he had cut ties with Daniela flooded back-the day she had knelt before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were Joyce, would she have made this choice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she bid him farewell with a gesture of gratitude as her parting act?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely not-she wasn&#39;t the type to do that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Joyce, her own well-being always took precedence over anything or anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dinner table, Katrina, wreathed in guilt, flashed sheepish, apologetic smiles at Richard and Alexander,while Caiden watched Joyce closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce seemed preoccupied with herself, fussing and failing to see the bigger picture.She had potential for so much more, yet she seemed to settle for less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this tense moment, Katrina shot Caiden a significant look, silently prompting him to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, please, have peace of mind. As long as you marry Joyce, everything from the Harper family will be yours and Joyce&#39;s, considering she&#39;s our only child. Isn&#39;t that right,Caiden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Caiden acutely sensed the possibility that Joyce&#39;s lack of foresight might actualy drain his personal resources to rectify her blunders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the wealth of the Harper family had been painstakingly accumulated by Daniela&#39;s mother, and while he had reaped the benefits, the idea of redistributing it, as suggested in hushed tones by the servants, was contrary to Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s wishes-and certainly not in line with Daniela&#39;s expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with the prospect of Joyce neglecting him in his later years, Caiden wondered desperately whom he could depend on. His thoughts whirled in confusion as the eyes of everyone at the dinner table turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, ever the opportunist, flashed a concerned yet calculating smile and probed, &#34;Caiden, is everything alright? You seem a bit off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence was not just social; he was there to secure a promise from the Harper family and to unearth the childhood sketches Daniela had created with that boy from years ago. His gaze, filled with faux concern, subtly urged Caiden for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina initially beamed a smile, which soon dissolved into a look of puzzlement. &#34;Caiden, didn&#39;t you mention you intended for everything to be left to Joyce and her future spouse? Wasn&#39;t that your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden smiled and took a sip of his wine. &#34;Richard, you must try this wine; it&#39;s exceptional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his response, Richard raised his eyebrow in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face stiffened, her smile vanishing as she reined in her brewing irritation, her features settling into a frosty mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tugged on Caiden&#39;s sleeve, her expression fraught with anxiety. When she could no longer contain her impatience, she leaned in and whispered urgently,&#34;Dad,why did you suddenly change the topic? Richard was only asking for your opinion. Just make it clear that the Harper family&#39;s assets are mine. Who else would you consider?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stated this as though it were the most natural conclusion, completely ignoring Daniela&#39;s existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Caiden hadn&#39;t given much thought to her dismissive attitude. However, this time, it stirred a sense of discomfort within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women, living under his roof and spending his money,seemed to constantly belittle and undermine his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glint flashed in Caiden&#39;s eyes, noticeable enough to make Katrina frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer and hissed, &#34;Caiden! What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden merely shrugged off her concern with a scoff and took another sip of his drink, ignoring her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, sensing the unresolved tension, chose not to press the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, he suggested that Alexander and Joyce might want to retire upstairs to see the study,while he himself strolled into the garden to make a discreet phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This maneuver tactfully gave Caiden and Katrina the opportunity they needed to have a private conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they were alone, Katrina&#39;s restraint shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the meaning of this, Caiden? Why didn&#39;t you say a damn thing just now? The Bennett family&#39;s finalizing everything, and all you did was sit there with your mouth shut like an idiot. What is it-can&#39;t bear to part with the family fortune? Or is it that you don&#39;t think my daughter deserves it? Let me guess-you&#39;re questioning if Joyce is even yours now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with emotion, Katrina hid her face in her hands, her body sinking to the floor as sobs racked her frame. &#34;You heartless man! I gave up the chance to have children with you because I didn&#39;t want Daniela to suffer. Now that my childbearing years are gone, you&#39;ve got the audacity to hold grudges?Caiden, you&#39;re nothing but a cruel, selfish asshole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sudden surge of fury, Katrina struck Caiden across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap echoed sharply, powerful enough to leave Caiden reeling in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, the atmosphere was starkly different.Alexander, with just a handful of gentle words, convinced Joyce to let him see Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, amidst the quiet and dust, he discovered a sketchbook. Flipping it open, he found the last message the boy had scribbled for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s meet tomorrow.&#34;</p>
