                <p>Daniela&#39;s safety was something Cedric had always insisted on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had assured him that she would not get hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the following day brought an unexpected injury for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric entered, he found Lillian tending to Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grim expression clouded Cedric&#39;s face, signaling his brewing anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his look, Lillian instinctively shrank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, Natalie and Nina also couldn&#39;t help but tense up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow was knotted with concern as he asked coldly, &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell over the room; no one dared to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up with a gentle smile,Daniela reassured. &#34;It&#39;s merely a minor accident from the elevator acting up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging her words with a nod, Cedric inspected her hand briefly before departing with a troubled frown. At the elevator, he asked Ryan, &#34;Explain what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his usual honesty,Ryan answered,&#34;There was a malfunction. The elevator stalled on the 25th floor.During the fix, it dropped. Daniela had to act fast to avoid worse harm and ended up injuring her hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasted no time and made an urgent call.&#34;Summon our elevator safety team, the manufacturers, and the designers to Elite Lux immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, the designers, manufacturers, repair crew, and safety team all gathered in the same place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They carefully examined every part of the elevator.both inside and out, until a glinting silver screw was finally handed to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze intensified, and his presence became more daunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping outside, he made another decisive call. &#34;No matter the expense, I want to know who compromised my wife&#39;s company&#39;s safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie approached,hoping to console Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she remained unnoticed, her presence overshadowed by his stern demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed so fierce, that one might think he harbored violent intentions. Previously,Natalie suspected Cedric&#39;s affection was motivated by Daniela&#39;s wealth and prestige.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,witnessing his profound concern today,she reconsidered; perhaps Elyse had been correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s love for Daniela was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the incident, the Elite Lux building saw a significant security overhaul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric set aside all his tasks. Monitoring the comings and goings at the building was his only omission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian expressed her concern. &#34;Daniela, isn&#39;t Cedric taking this too far? You&#39;ve dealt with far worse before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, sharing her frustration, gently pulled Cedric to one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she adjusted his tousled collar, she said, &#34;Cedric,this might be nothing more than an accident. Please.can you try not to worry so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s anger erupted suddenly. &#34;You&#39;re not being truthful with me! Daniela, do you think I&#39;m naive? You used yourself as bait,and you expect me not to notice?Do you really believe I&#39;m that ignorant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;I assure you, I won&#39;t endanger myself again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood in disbelief, unable to accept the thought of watching Daniela suffer once more. It was too much for him to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew convincing Cedric during his stubborn moments was useless; it would only escalate to more disputes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no alternative,Daniela agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela ascended the stairs, Natalie approached with a coffee in hand. &#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t see how much you care. It&#39;s sad, really. She&#39;s ungrateful, and you deserve better. You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s sentence was cut short by Cedric&#39;s cold stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice low and filled with barely contained fury,he asked sharply, &#34;Whom are you calling ungrateful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was taken aback by his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked in a menacing tone, &#34;Have you nothing better to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had never witnessed such fury in Cedric;he seemed ready to unleash annihilation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse observed the scene unfold from afar. Her expression turned grim. Natalie&#39;s desire for Cedric to leave Daniela for her seemed delusional; he would never entertain such thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, heartbroken and defiant, murmured softly.&#34;Cealmaur, right? Besides Daniela, I want Cedric dead too. I have a villa, and I have myself. Even if I have to sell my body, I want them dead.&#34; She would become powerful and have everything she wanted over Daniela&#39;s and Cedric&#39;s dead bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who despised her would bow down to her.</p>
