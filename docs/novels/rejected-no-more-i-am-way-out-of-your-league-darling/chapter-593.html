                <p>In the hospital, Hackett was bustling around, speaking with the attending physician. &#34;Doctor, this man is my closest friend. Please, make sure he gets a full examination-no detail overlooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the reporters, he raised a hand, his tone commanding yet measured. &#34;That&#39;s enough for today. No more pictures. Huey&#39;s been through a traumatic ordeal. Give us some space. We&#39;ll issue a statement when the time is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the press handled, Hackett made a brief stop at a nearby fruit shop, selecting a basket of fresh fruit and a bouquet of flowers before heading back upstairs to Huey&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huey, you nearly gave me a heart attack back there.&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice wNas laced with concern as he set the fruit basket down. &#34;I was terrified. What the hell happened? You were supposed to hold on. Why did you let go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey pressed his lips together, his gaze distant, offering no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett exhaled, his voice gentler now. &#34;Alright, I get it. You&#39;re still shaken. Just rest up. I&#39;ve spoken with the hospital-everything&#39;s taken care of. You don&#39;t have to worry about a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Hackett looked every bit the devoted friend-his words, his actions, all painted the picture of someone deeply concerned. To an outsider, he might even seem likea man with a genuinely kind heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Hackett departed, accompanied by the members of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped out of the ward, Marcus shot Hackett a questioning look. &#34;So what really happened back there? How did you suddenly lose your grip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley frowned, nodding. &#34;Yeah. Huey barely made it. What went wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett sighed, his face grave. &#34;I&#39;ve been thinking about that too. It&#39;s strange, really. But if I recall correctly,Cedric bumped my arm at that exact moment. That&#39;s why I lost my grip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face twisted with hurt. &#34;What are you imnplying? That I&#39;d lie about this? Huey&#39;s my best friend.Why would I ever harm him? Use your heads. Between me and Cedric, who has more reason to go after Huey? It&#39;s obvious-it has to be Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; brows knitted together. &#34;But in the end, it was Cedric who saved Huey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s shoulders slumped, his voice thick with emotion. &#34;Exactly! That&#39;s Cedric&#39;s game-he wants to turn us against each other. Do I really have to spell this out? My God, after all&#39;these years of brotherhood, you&#39;d rather believe Cedric over me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett ran a hand through his hair, shaking his head in disbelief. &#34;This is killing me, guys. I never thought you&#39;d doubt me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s display was so heartfelt, so convincing, that none of them could say for sure what had really happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled over the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, Marcus&#39; voice cut through the silence. &#34;Wait a minute. Didn&#39;t you say you called the fire department? So why wasn&#39;t there a safety cushion below?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest moment, something unreadable flickered in Hackett&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group fixed their eyes on him, their expressions unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett clutched his chest, feigning disbelief. &#34;How would I know? Are you suggesting that I deliberately kept the fire department away? The roads were packed! You saw it yourselves. The fire truck was stuck on the overpass. Are you going to pin that on me too? This is absurd!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single tear slipped down his cheek-just enough to sell the performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno exhaled, shaking his head. &#34;Hackett, don&#39;t overdo it. We&#39;re just talking things through-no need to take it personally. We don&#39;t know what really happened. From where we stood, we saw you and Cedric run out, but in the end, it was Cedric who saved Huey. Can you blame us for having doubts? Once Huey&#39;s better, the truth will come out on its own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a weary sigh, nodding as if the weight of their doubt crushed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His car pulled up first, but he hesitated. Leaving now meant giving them time to talk-time to twist the story against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus gestured toward the waiting vehicle. &#34;Go on, Hackett. Your car&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, Hackett climbed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he didn&#39;t leave. Instead, he had the driver circle the block before pulling into a discreet spot behind them, ears sharp for every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; voice was laced with suspicion. &#34;Hackett&#39;s as slippery as they come. There&#39;s something off about him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley nodded in agreement. &#34;Exactly! The fire department should&#39;ve been on-site right away. So why were they missing when it mattered most?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno frowned. &#34;From where I was standing, I caught a glimpse outside. Looked to me like Hackett let go of Huey while Cedric was holding on Huey tightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp narrowed his eyes. &#34;I heard Hackett&#39;s company is circling the drain. He&#39;s desperate, willing to use anything to make Daniela back off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense silence settled over the group as they exchanged knowing glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, their cars pulled up, and they each departed, leaving the conversation hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden in the shadows, Hackett clenched his fists. Fury boiled beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traitors.Every last one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They actually believed Cedric over him? Unforgivable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all deserved to die! And Marcus was the worst of them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t Marcus just trying to secure an alliance with Huey&#39;s family through marriage? They hadn&#39;t even sealed the deal yet, but Marcus was already acting like part of Huey&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett lowered his gaze, anger simmering as he read a text from the bank demanding overdue payment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the sky darkened, mirroring the murderous intent flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his phone and called Marcus, his tone humble-completely at odds with the cold expression on his face. &#34;Marcus, are you home? Listen, I need to talk to you about Huey&#39;s situation. Just you and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others are too worked up, but you&#39;re rational. I wanted to speak with you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus hesitated before replying, &#34;Let&#39;s just discuss it tomorrow with everyone. No need for a private conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t forgotten what they&#39;d just talked about-Hackett&#39;s company was nothing but a shell now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man was a master of deception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even tried to kill Huey today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting him alone was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hackett wasn&#39;t about to give up. &#34;Come on, what&#39;s there to be afraid of? I won&#39;t bite. Didn&#39;t you say you wanted your daughter to marry into Huey&#39;s family? You&#39;re looking for a wedding gown for your daughter,right? I have a top-tier designer at my place tonight. You should come check out the designs-he&#39;s flying overseas tomorrow, so this is your only chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marcus could refuse,Hackett ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus was known for spoiling his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was certain-Marcus would come.</p>
