                <p>Chapter in its history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two years ago, a senior executive had walked out,shamelessly dragging an entire production line with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following year, the company&#39;s top salesperson had resigned, taking their most lucrative client with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This year,the situation had deteriorated further. A slew  of key employees had defected, draining all business from the northern region. Caiden had spent hours furiously cursing and shouting, yet his efforts were futile against the rapid decline of Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had offered to sell them medicine for three hundred million, but even if they sold the entire company, it wouldn&#39;t fetch that amount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The factory workers had lost their drive, going through the motions without passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The machinery had been neglected since Brylee&#39;s demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the office,most employees were biding their time, eagerly anticipating bankruptcy to claim their severance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Katrina, Daniela&#39;s offer to salvage this floundering company seemed like a reasonable arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her view, by taking on this challenge, Daniela would effectively be serving their cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making this realization, Katrina&#39;s spirits lifted considerably, and she set about persuading Caiden.&#34;Why not show some generosity for a change? Pass the reins of the company to Daniela. With Elite Lux&#39;s backing, she&#39;ll bolster Harper Group effortlessly,Imagine us in the future, just relaxing at home while profits from Harper Group pad our bank account. Doesn&#39;t that sound wonderful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stroking his arm lightly, she went on, &#34;Daniela has everything she could possibly desire. She doesn&#39;t actually need Harper Group for herself. She&#39;s only interested because it holds sentimental value-Brylee built it from nothing. As long as that emotional tie remains,Daniela will never let Harper Group falter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden looked over at Katrina, skepticism flickering in his eyes. &#34;Do you really believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Let Daniela deal with the hard stuff while she works her ass off making us money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This reassurance seemed to ease Caiden&#39;s concerns somewhat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing down at the newborn cradled in his arms,his mood brightened even more, and he declared, &#34;You&#39;re right! Let Daniela accumulate wealth for our little treasure-plenty of it! Tomorrow, I&#39;ll head over to the company.Honestly,these years in charge have been nothing short of grueling!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always felt out of place in his role. His subordinates held little regard for him, and his series of missteps had led to a string of disasters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing significant orders time and again, his standing in the company had deteriorated irreparably.Even he had to admit that he was in over his head and  it was time for him to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a renewed sense of resolve, Caiden took out his phone and composed a message to Daniela, asking her to join him at Harper Group the following day to discuss the management transition. He was prepared to relinquish his position as chairman and pass on the leadership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard and Alexander walked away from the hospital room in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they strolled down the hallway, Richard broke the silence. &#34;Katrina&#39;s cunning and manipulative ways are something else. And with Daniela&#39;s tenacity, don&#39;t be surprised if Harper Group makes a swift comeback,especially with Elite Lux in their corner. Considering Katrina&#39;s influence, Joyce&#39;s prospects are looking pretty solid. It&#39;s something you might want to ponder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard glanced over at him, only to find Alexander&#39;s face devoid of any reaction, as if the words had passed him by unheard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard let out a quiet sigh. It was clear Alexander still hadn&#39;t gotten over Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they returned to Alexander&#39;s ward, Caiden burst in. &#34;I&#39;ll be seeing Daniela tomorrow at Harper Group to wrap up the handover. Alexander, you have a knack for these negotiations. Could you join me? And about Joyce and the baby-we owe you so much,Alexander.Once things calm down, we&#39;ll throw a grand banquet in your honor. Would you mind accompanying me tomorrow? Daniela... well,you know her tactics. She&#39;s sly and full of maneuvers. There&#39;s no way I can take her on alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard shot a look at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, Alexander signaled his agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden departed with a joyful stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he was gone, Richard emitted a sharp scoff. &#34;What an impudent request. If it weren&#39;t for your intervention, their baby would be undergoing surgery right now. And all they promise is a banquet in the future? He didn&#39;t even bother to bring a gift for you, and now he brazenly asks for your help again tomorrow? It&#39;s astounding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Alexander, Richard&#39;s expression darkened with fury. &#34;Are you actually planning to go with that bastard tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging the blanket over himself, Alexander settled into the hospital bed and replied, &#34;Yeah.&#34; Richard opened his mouth to protest, but Alexander had already shut his eyes, cutting off further discussion.</p>
