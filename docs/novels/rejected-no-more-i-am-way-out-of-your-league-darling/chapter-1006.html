                <p>The following day arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around midday,Daniela sat in the living room, quietly focused on a stack of research notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the housekeeper approached Carol and said,&#34;Miss Blake, there&#39;s someone at the door asking to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still absorbed in her game, Carol glanced up and spotted Nikolasstanding outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meaning to, she paused the screen and turned to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, calm as always, said gently, &#34;Since he&#39;s already come, you might as well hear what he wants to say. It&#39;s better to have clarity than let things stay muddled. That&#39;s not like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a nod, placed her phone down without a word, and rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas remained at the entrance, looking far less certain than usual. His confidence seemed to have taken a hit. &#34;Carol,&#34; he said in a quiet tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood still, her expression blank. The usual indifference in her eyes had deepened into distance. &#34;Didn&#39;t Daniela already speak to you yesterday?&#34;she asked. &#34;What she said sums up everything I think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a small shake of his head. &#34;I know,but I&#39;ve been thinking things over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol responded with a slight smirk, &#34;And what exactly do you need to think about? If it&#39;s whether or not to turn your back on your own family for my sake, then don&#39;t bother. Once you start weighing pros and cons,your decision&#39;s already made. You don&#39;t have to reach out again. Let&#39;s leave it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned away and stepped back inside, her steps firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stayed frozen on the doorstep. Brad, having witnessed what happened, hurried out of the villa and closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the narrow gap, Brad&#39;s voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, have you lost your mind? What on earth are you doing here? You&#39;re really throwing away Miss Rowe for Carol? Are you trying to give your father a heart attack? Get in the car. NJow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word,Brad shoved Nikolas into the vehicle. As the engine came to life, he took out his phone and dialed Hamilton&#39;s number. &#34;Hamilton. I&#39;ve got something big. Nikolas just came to see Carol.He still won&#39;t give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hamilton said something, Brad answered, &#34;Carol didn&#39;t even give him a chance to speak. He&#39;s the one chasing her like a fool. Wasn&#39;t he supposed to meet Miss Rowe today? Keep an eye on him to avoid any mishaps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chuckled to himself. As far as he was concerned,Hamilton wouldn&#39;t be interfering anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Daniela was going to die soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Brad had even asked Hamilton about Nikolas &#39;meeting time with Miss Rowe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a look at Carol&#39;s blank expression and narrowed his eyes with a grin that didn&#39;t reach them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, turning to Daniela, he walked over with a familiar smugness. &#34;You&#39;ve been so kind to me. l haven&#39;t done much to show my thanks. How about dinner tonight? There&#39;s a new upscale place I know. I&#39;d love to take you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up from her reading.′′NOinterested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t turn me down so fast. This place just opened and it&#39;s getting great reviews. I had to pull some strings to get us in. It&#39;s located in Oiscoll&#39;s Landmark building. The chefs there are supposed to be good-looking. Carol&#39;s been in a mood lately. Maybe seeing a few charming faces will lift her spirits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flipped to the next page and let out a quiet snort. &#34;No, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad froze. His grin slipped. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;That fancy restaurant you picked-Red Maple? It&#39;s owned by Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad froze on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went on, &#34;You see where I&#39;m going with this?We&#39;ve eaten there plenty of times. Those dishes you talked up? We already know they&#39;re good. Carol&#39;s the one who picked the chefs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t know how to respond. How rich were these people? They even ran a restaurant in a place that upscale. Not even the McCoys splurged like that when they were still riding high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling annoyed, Brad turned and wandered off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Carol stopped by the same restaurant to check on things. She spotted Nikolas dining with Miss Rowe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even glance their way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, on the other hand, caught sight of her and panicked so badly he tipped his wine glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spill landed straight on his trousers. Across the room,Hamilton saw it happen and frowned. Hamilton followed Nikolas&#39; nervous gaze. While Nikolas looked guilty, Carol remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even told a waiter to bring over napkins and had a nice bottle of wine delivered to Nlikolas&#39; table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after, she turned to the kitchen. Nikolas sprang to his feet and started after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a long breath and turned to Egan.&#34;Please excuse me.&#34; He got up and hurried toward Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind? Do you even understand what&#39;s going on right now? Why are you headed to the kitchen? Miss Rowe is right there watching you.Turn around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stammered, &#34;Carol saw us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shut his eyes tight, fighting the urge to scream.Unbelievable. What kind of mess was this? He wasn&#39;t even the romantic type. How had he ended up with a bunch of kids who couldn&#39;t think straight?Totally lovesick fools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares if she saw you? What are you even afraid of? You&#39;re not even dating her. What&#39;s there to be afraid of? Stop acting like she&#39;s already your wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas ignored him and pressed forward, but Hamilton grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back. &#34;If you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re feeling. Sit down and eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave the kitchen one last look, but then sank back into his seat.</p>
