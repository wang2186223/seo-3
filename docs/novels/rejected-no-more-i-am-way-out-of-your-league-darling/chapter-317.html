                <p>As soon as Alexander noticed Daniela, he sat up quickly. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, realizing he was awake,started to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Alexander called out. &#34;Are you really going to just walk away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;What? Haven&#39;t you been beaten enough? You want me to stay and hit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain flickered in Alexander&#39;s eyes. &#34;After everything we&#39;ve been through, can&#39;t you at least speak to me kindly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed he had intervened to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought she should be thankful, not harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart ached, his spirits sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt his sincere efforts wvere completely ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed his feelings as ridiculous. &#34;Just keep out of my affairs next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at Daniela in shock. &#34;I saved you! Is this your thanks to someone who saved you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued walking without replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Alexander yelled, &#34;Daniela, doesn&#39;t my risking my life for you deserve another chance? Am I inferior to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped briefly, then chuckled. &#34;The audacity, comparing yourself to Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained motionless. He was bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Daniela was fiercely loyal to those she cared about. To others, she was indifferent. Yet, here she was, vehemently defending Cedric. This realization chilled Alexander. &#34;What do you mean by that? What exactly is happening between you and Cedric that makes you defend him so passionately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t see the need to elaborate. Her relationship with Cedric was clear and uncomplicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, due to Alexander&#39;s close relationship with Katrina, Daniela chose not to disclose details that might reach Katrina. It simply wasn&#39;t worth the risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re just friends,&#34; she remarked casually, looking down at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was reading Cedric&#39;s message when footsteps approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quirked an eyebrow. &#34;Cedric, did you hear that?&#34; he exclaimed with evident glee, his eyebrows raised in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela understood that Alexander had tricked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Alexander pretended to be disappointed, eyeing Daniela. &#34;Just friends, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Cedric disappointed was a rare sight for Alexander, and he was visibly pleased by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s mood remained uplifted even after Daniela had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to hope as long as Daniela was not officially with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never become a couple, leading him to believe they never would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt confident, considering his recent close encounter with Daniela during the kidnapping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on their shared ordeal, Alexander smiled and started browsing the trending news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrolled but found no reports on their kidnapping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brow furrowed deeply in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seemed incorrect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was there no news? Shouldn&#39;t the police have caught those criminals by now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their level of influence, Alexander expected some media coverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to search without success and eventually contacted a few media outlets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They confirmed having no information on the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s last memory was being punched by one kidnapper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela had not informed the authorities, how had they escaped without issue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What more did he not understand about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce was taken aback by Daniela&#39;s unharmed condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even more troubling, Joyce had just received a menacing message from Flash, her debt collector,threatening to sell her if she failed to pay within five days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Joyce shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was groggy as she answered a call from her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, you&#39;re aware that Joyce has only five days to clear her debt, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Katrina responded, her brow furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your thoughts? It&#39;s quite urgent. We&#39;re out of options. Remember that affluent man I told you earlier? What do you think about meeting him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hesitated, biting her lip. &#34;Mom, could you possibly lend me some money instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence lingered on the line,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, over the years, I&#39;ve contributed a lot to you. Surely you have some savings left. I&#39;m really in a bind and have no other options. Could you lend me a part of it? I promise to repay you once I&#39;mn back on stable ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a detached, terse tone, Erika responded, &#34;I&#39;Il see what&#39;s available, though it might not be much. Why must you be so stubborn? You have an opportunity with a good man now, yet you choose to stay with Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What do you gain from that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, Mom. I just need a little support,&#34; Katrina replied,maintaining a neutral tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation concluded abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was nervously awaiting Katrina&#39;s decision to assist, only to receive a brief message instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, your grandmother has agreed to lend you the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Infuriated by the disappointing outcome, Joyce threw her phone across the room, watching it smash into pieces.</p>
