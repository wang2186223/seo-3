                <p>Daniela was reviewing reports in her office when Lillian entered. &#34;Daniela, Hackett and the others are here to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the data, her lips curling into a faint smile. &#34;They certainly didn&#39;t waste any time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian crossed her arms. &#34;They&#39;re here to plead with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, set aside the reports, and rose from her desk. &#34;Let&#39;s go meet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked down to the reception room on the ground floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group waited until Daniela was seated before they took their own seats, showing a marked deference from their previous encounters.  &#34;Ms. Harper, we understand you appreciate fresh seafood. We&#39;ve brought you some premium deep-sea fish that just arrived in the city this morning.Perhaps you&#39;d like to try it,&#34; Hackett suggested,signaling his secretary to hand the gift box to Lillian,who was standing behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The box was heavy, prompting Lillian to call over a security guard to take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it pleases you, I can arrange for more to be sent,&#34;Hackett added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other six members of the group exchanged looks, their expressions souring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t Hackett inform them to bring gifts too?How could he manage this alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This oversight left their smiles forced, a hint of resentment towards Hackett coloring their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile broadened slightly. &#34;Thank you, Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Graves. What brings you all here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett glanced at his colleagues. They straightened up, their faces serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, always quick to speak, broke the silence first.&#34;Ms. Harper, it seems there has been a significant misunderstanding between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice carried a hint of amusement. &#34;Oh,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno interjected, &#34;Yes, a severe misunderstanding.We only just realized ouur mistake and thought it crucial to clarify things with you, Ms. Harper. We wouldn&#39;t want to be misjudged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow. &#34;That sounds quite grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett also added, &#34;Indeed, it&#39;s mainly my fault for not grasping your intentions earlier. We came here today to set the record straight. You know,when your mother&#39;s company, now Harper Group, rose to prominence and became an industry leader, we genuinely wanted her to join the association.However, because of one person, a misunderstanding arose between us, and that led to the tension and distance that followed. After your mother passed, we deeply regretted not resolving these issues with her. Now that you&#39;re here, we hope to correct that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett spoke eloquently, his tone filled with remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other six nodded emphatically. &#34;Yes, we truly regretted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed them quietly, offering no immediate response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room&#39;s atmosphere tensed up, but Hackett continued, &#34;In fact, we&#39;ve always held your mother in high regard. It&#39;s remarkable that she built such a large business as a woman. Unfortunately, she was cursed with a malicious sister and a foolish husband,which led to her tragic demise. Such a pitiful situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett sighed deeply before continuing, &#34;What we need to clarify today involves the structure of our association. Originally, we had eight leadership  positions and the rest were members. We intended to elect your mother as a leader, but another individual yearned for that spot. When he discovered our plans to nominate your mother, he took drastic actions against her. It&#39;s bewildering to us. It was just a leadership role. Why would someone resort to harming a woman over it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other six members nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno interjected, &#34;I suggested at that time we could simply create an additional leadership position.It wasn&#39;t a big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley added, &#34;Exactly, rules were rigid, but there was always room for flexibility. Some people just took things too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc said, &#34;Some people would do anything to get what they wanted. It&#39;s completely perplexing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several members voiced their thoughts in succession. They were attempting to deflect blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled thinly. &#34;What do you mean? I&#39;m confused.Are you suggesting my mother&#39;s death wasn&#39;t merely an accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her query visibly shocked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Who are you referring to when you mention &#39;some people&#39;? Are you indicating that this person was responsible for my mother&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were momentarily speechless, their thoughts scrambled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did this mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t aware of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did their admissions make them look foolish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Daniela&#39;s focus on them stem solely from a business rivalry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could that be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces fluctuated between pale and flushed, displaying both embarrassment and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked around calmly. &#34;Who exactly are you talking about when you say &#39;some people&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes swept the group. &#34;Oh, Winslow isn&#39;t here today. Did you deliberately exclude him, or are you implying he&#39;s the one responsible? If you believed he killed my mother, why didn&#39;t you go to the police then? Why bring this up only now, after so much time?&#34;</p>
