                <p>The moment the word &#34;wife&#34; slipped out, Nikolas&#39;brows tightened ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the tense circumstances, Cedric calling Daniela his &#34;wife&#34; feIt almost too personal-like stepping over an invisible line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas always saw Cedric as dangerously smart-and that sharp intellect now made him uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When you tangled with the sharp-minded, one misstep could land you checkmated before you even saw the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nikolas knew he had no better option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all people, Cedric was the,one man Daniela wouldn&#39;t want to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking you to do anything else,&#34; Nikolas said, his voice tight. &#34;All I need is for you to keep Daniela in check.&#34; Cedric chuckled, the sound dripping with scorn,like he&#39;d just heard the biggest joke of the century.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can give you something in return!&#34; Nikolas blurted,panicking as Cedric turned to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t even flinch. To him, Nikolas had nothing of value-nothing worth staying for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Nikolas cried out, a last-ditch plea spilling from his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Cedric froze. He turned back slowly, eyes narrowing like a blade being drawn. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas jumped at the chance to respond, &#34;I said Daniela! Cedric, she&#39;s lost her memories. Right now,to her, you&#39;re just another face in the crowd. Maybe there&#39;s a flicker of connection, but it&#39;s faint, barely there. And you know that better than anyone. You also know she&#39;s in the middle of sorting out Elite Lux&#39;s holdings. She&#39;s making plans to go to Oiscoll-with Charles by her side. You&#39;re not part of that plan,Cedric. She doesn&#39;t intend to bring you along. But if you work with me, you&#39;ll have every right to go with us to Oiscoll. And once you&#39;re there, you&#39;ll have the chance to win her back. Isn&#39;t that a better shot than waiting here? Daniela&#39;s forgotten everything. If she heads to Oiscoll alone, can you honestly sit back and feel at peace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas eyed Cedric&#39;s sharply defined profile and swallowed hard, nerves tightening in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, believe me-I&#39;m only asking you to help keep Daniela in check. That&#39;s all. I have no hidden agenda. This is strictly a McCoy family issue, and truthfully, her interference doesn&#39;t make sense. You love her deeply, don&#39;t you? Then I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think about what&#39;s best for her. You know how powerful and deeply rooted the McCoy family is. Even someone as capable as Daniela would be walking into danger alone, and you can&#39;t honestly say she won&#39;t get hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was banking on the hope that Cedric still had no idea Daniela led a mercenary force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused before pressing on, &#34;Daniela may be strong-willed, but at the end of the day, she&#39;s still just one woman. Asking her to face the McCoy family head-on-it&#39;s too much. I know she&#39;s going there to uncover the truth about her mother&#39;s death. I won&#39;t stop her. That doesn&#39;t interfere with my plans. In fact, I&#39;mn even willing to help, as long as she stays out of the family&#39;s power struggles. I came to you because this helps you too. Call it an alliance with me if you want, but really, it&#39;s a way to keep her safe.Isn&#39;t that the smarter move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas genuinely believed his argument was airtight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after all that talking, Cedric&#39;s face didn&#39;t flinch-not ev/en a twitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas cursed under his breath. Just how stubborn could this couple get?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tight-lipped, he asked, &#34;So, what&#39;s your take?&#34; His eyes clung to Cedric, desperate for even the slightest nod of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a frosty smirk. &#34;Who do you think you&#39;re fooling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face hardened in aninstant. Cedric said evenly, &#34;She&#39;s taking me with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was momentarily stunned-he hadn&#39;t expected Cedric to sound so certain. &#34;Daniela? You really think she&#39;s taking you? You&#39;re not even part of the plan she made with Charles. I checked the McCoy family&#39;s private jet manifest myself-your name&#39;s not on it. If she truly wanted you wwith her,would you still be standing here? Has she told you to pack? Given you any company tasks to wrap up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was nearing his breaking point. &#34;How does someone so sharp end up so completely blind when it ccomes to love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t breathed a word about bringing him,yet Cedric clung to the idea like it was gospel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t bother to reply. He just turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, mentally unraveling. He&#39;d armed himself with every possible angle to win Cedric over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he hadn&#39;t anticipated this-Cedric&#39;s unshakable belief that Daniela would take him along. Where did he get that unbreakable trust?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nearly lost it. He yelled after Cedric&#39;s retreating figure, &#34;Come find me when you&#39;ve changed your mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he muttered to himself, &#34;Who knew the McCoy family could birth a lovesick fool?&#34;</p>
