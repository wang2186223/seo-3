                <p>Daniela could practically feel the smugness radiating off Nikolas recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We needn&#39;t rush into collaboration. We can revisit it in a few days. I&#39;ve never been to Olisvine before, so I&#39;d like to take my time exploring the city,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed him skeptically. &#34;Seriously? Are you sure you&#39;ve never been to Olisvine before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric excused himself to give instructions to his secretary, Nikolas snapped, &#34;How long will you drag up ancient history? I&#39;ve told you before that I only had your father released from the asylum because I was worried Cedric would seize control of your assets. His growing influence was a threat, and I couldn&#39;t ignore it. That&#39;s all there was to it. I had nothing to do with that explosion at your villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted the notebook, her eyes drifting to Nikolas&#39; signature as she examined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was noticeably different from the handwriting on the note Joyce had given her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant someone else had saved Joyce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela squinted, her expression darkening. Cedric walked in, his gaze landing on Daniela&#39;s expression before he turned to Nikolas with a frown.&#34;What did you say to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scoffed, &#34;None of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Nikolas&#39; eyes, Cedric was utterly useless and nothing more than Daniela&#39;s pet project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, a man like Cedric, obsessed with women,rarely accomplished anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should he even bother competing for the family estate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had no choice but to wait for Ghost to arrive and take Daniela&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas left Elite Lux, Alexander approached him.&#34;Who are you? I&#39;ve seen you go in and out of Elite Lux for days now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that any of your business?&#34; Nikolas sneered, eyeing the man who looked obsessed with plastic surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Daniela&#39;s ex-husband!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; jaw dropped. &#34;Excuse me? What did you just say?&#34; Daniela had another man besides Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you? Elite Lux isn&#39;t a place you can just enter and exit as you please.&#34;The man standing before him bore a striking resemblance to Cedric, putting Alexander on high alert. He couldn&#39;t shake the thought that Daniela had grown tired of Cedric and was now looking for someone new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite spending a fortune on facial reconstruction,Alexander&#39;s appearance was still far from flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He despised Cedric and wished he could end him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas studied Alexander for a few moments before scoffing, &#34;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re Daniela&#39;s ex-husband.Even wth Cedric&#39;s disability, at least he has a decent face. With your looks, Daniela wouldn&#39;t choose you even if she were blind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face twisted with rage as he felt insulted.&#34;Go ask Cedric yourself if I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s ex-husband!Cedric is the home-wrecker! He stole my wife! And now he has the audacity to refuse to give her back.Cedric is the most shameless man in the world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squinted when he heard this. &#34;You still have feelings for Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded,&#34;Of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint flickered in Nikolas&#39; eyes. &#34;If she really means that much to you, fight for her. Be a man! Cedric&#39;s got a lame leg. Sooner or later, Daniela will grow tired of him.&#34; Alexander&#39;s frustration boiled over. &#34;But I can&#39;t even get close to Daniela. She won&#39;t let me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s security was strict beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas handed over his badge with a casual shrug.&#34;I&#39;ll have them make me another one later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ally against a shared enemy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander could manage to take Daniela and leave Cedric behind, there would be no need for Ghost to intervene. Nikolas could dismantle Phillips Group with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, exhilarated, asked Nikolas, &#34;May I ask who you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked, his tone dripping with arrogance. &#34;I&#39;m Nikolas McCoy, the eldest son of the world&#39;s richest man,Hamilton McCoy.&#34;</p>
