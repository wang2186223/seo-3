                <p>Lilian was a bundle of nerves as she went to Daniela&#39;s room. &#34;Daniela, Cedric has been behaving rather oddly lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was engrossed in her puzzle, hardly looking up as she mirrored Ryan&#39;s earlier dismissive tone.&#34;Oh,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liflian grasped Daniela&#39;s hand. &#34;Seriously, don&#39;t brush this off. Men either simmer in silence or erupt without warning. I think he&#39;s teetering on the edge, about to lose it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time Daniela had encountered such a colorful portrayal. She burst into laughter, unable to contain herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian squinted with a hint of mischief. &#34;Daniela, I suspect his eccentricity stems from his long, unsuccessful campaign to win your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Cedric was channel surfing, unimpressed by the offerings. His gaze drifted upstairs,restless. No television drama could hold a candle to the intrigue of observing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley approached with a bottle of juice, leaning in to subtly showcase her figure. &#34;It&#39;s sweltering today.Have some juice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric barely acknowledged her, nudging her aside with the remote. &#34;You&#39;re blocking the view!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s grip on the bottle tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Cedric even interested in women?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just passed up a golden opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps his interests lay elsewhere?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley studied Cedric&#39;s chiseled features. A sudden realization dawned on her, widening her eyes in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned incredulously to glance at Ryan sitting nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Cedric preferred Ryan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s voice wavered. &#34;What do you think of Ryan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at her, reading her like an open book. After a brief pause,he nodded.&#34;He&#39;s great,&#34; he affirmed, giving Ryan&#39;s leg a casual pat. Ryan remained oblivious, but Shirley&#39;s world seemed to crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like men?&#34; Shirley lowered her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Cedric responded without missing a beat. But in truth, his heart yearned for women, Daniela in particular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s face turned pale and she forced a smile. &#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll keep your secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I hold a high position, and discretion is paramount. It could impact my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded. &#34;Okay, thank you for trusting me! I promise I won&#39;t tell a soul!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded internally, adding silently,&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s mind was abuzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a moment to find her footing, moving with awkward haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, she hastily gathered her belongings and departed, leaving Katrina confused and perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the sudden exit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted to intercept her, but Shirley didn&#39;t even glance back, rebuking, &#34;Before matchmaking, you should at least get your facts straight. You&#39;ve wasted so much of my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, puzzled, responded, &#34;What do you mean?&#34; &#34;What do I mean? I mean exactly what I said! I promised not to tell anyone, but now I see why Cedric frequents Daniela&#39;s room as if it were his own, and why she trusts him impticitly. Now it all makes sense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Shirley stormed off, teaving Katrina standing there, utterly thrown off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was really happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth had gone down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Katrina tried to follow her, Shirley was already out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the living room, Ryan was doubled over with laughter. &#34;Does Shirley has a brain? What was she even thinking? How could she possibly believe you like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dealt with the situation silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katrina reentered the room, her expression stormy, she demanded, &#34;Cedric, what did you say to Shirley? Why did she leave in tears? Did you mistreat her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t bother to be polite, turning with a sharp, cold stare. &#34;Do you really think I&#39;m someone to be trampled upon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was piercing, sending a chill down Katrina&#39;s spine.</p>
