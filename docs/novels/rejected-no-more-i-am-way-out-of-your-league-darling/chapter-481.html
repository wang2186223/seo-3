                <p>Daniela had checked with Cedric&#39;s secretary, and Cedric would attend tonight&#39;s charity auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, the moment Daniela wrapped up work, she went straight to Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary met her downstairs and escorted her up. As they reached his office, she caught his voice mid-conversation.&#34;You still can&#39;t find it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply was too faint to hear, but Cedric&#39;s face tightened,disappointment flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, thanks. Let me know if anything else comes up,&#34; Cedric said,ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he turned around and noticed Daniela standing at the door, unsure of when she had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped inside. &#34;What are you searching for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew she hadn&#39;t heard much. He tightened his grip on his phone and shook his head. &#34;Nothing important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved. &#34;You&#39;re going to the auction,right? I came to get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fingers pressed into his phone. He was direct-sometimes,being tough was necessary to make things clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he met Daniela&#39;s steady gaze, the words caught in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped in frustration. &#34;Daniela...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela only smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exhaled.&#34;We&#39;re still fighting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, unbothered. &#34;I know. Forgiving me too fast feels too easy. doesn&#39;t it? You&#39;re still not satisfied, That&#39;s fine-I can keep pacifying you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt his resolve slipping. Daniela was flawless.except for one thing-she was just as stubborn as he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need you to pacify me, Daniela.I just want to know-who are you really after? Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s just Natalie and Elyse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Daniela, Natalie and Elyse were nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was being this careful, there had to be a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the way she had rejected him before-cold and absolute-told him there was something bigger lurking beneath. Cedric was sharp. Lying to him was pointless. She wasn&#39;t going to lie, but she wasn&#39;t ready to tell the whole truth either. Instead, she repeated what she&#39;d told him a dozen times before. &#34;Just wait a little longer.I&#39;ll tell you everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed, that familiar frustration washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had run out of options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela made a decision, nothing could change it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew he wasn&#39;t her exception and that realization cut deeper than he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I won&#39;t be attending the charity auction with you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s anger simmered beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could never understand why Daniela had to be so stubborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he was sure-he didn&#39;t matter to her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip, hesitated, then stood up with a light chuckle. &#34;Well... alright. I&#39;ll leave. Don&#39;t be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck a nerve, igniting what little patience he had left.Cedric let out a sharp laugh, his eyes dark with frustration. &#34;Do you even care if I&#39;m upset? Acting like you&#39;re doing me a favor-it doesn&#39;t make me happy at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Cedric truly lost his temper with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze. She wanted to comfort him,but she didn&#39;t know how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost her mother at five, and from that moment,she never learned how to comfort anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how to make Cedric happy or how to ask him to wait just a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Alexander, money had been enough to buy peace.But with Cedric,it wouldn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d see it as an insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t know any other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she pressed her lips together, forcing back a smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;Then...&#34; She blinked, her vision burning. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had nothing else to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other than an apology, she had nothing to give Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back, unable to even pretend to smile She turned and left,leaving Cedric&#39;s secretary in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, what are you doing? You were anxiously waiting for her to come, and now that she&#39;s here,why are you pushing her away with such harsh words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had ever seen Daniela look so lost. One of the wealthiest people in the world, yet she had no idea how to comfort the man she loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary frowned. &#34;Mr. Phillips, that was cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lowered his eyes, his jaw tightening. He had already taken the first step-hesitating now would only make him look weak. So, he braced himself and took the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his grip on his phone, frustration twisting in his chest. When he looked up, his expression was cold, unreadable. &#34;Tonight, have Lydia Vargas accompany me to the charity auction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia Vargas was a fresh-faced starlet under Phillips Group&#39;s entertainment division.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was bold in her actions, even bolder in her wardrobe. Rumors swirled that she had only signed with Phillips Group to get closer to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even declared in interviews that her only I was towin him over. In the entertainment industry, moral standards were often flimsy, and so-called principles were easily cast aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter if someone was married, as long as they got what they wanted-power,wealth, a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, why don&#39;t you just talk to your wife? Is provoking her like this really a good idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern etched across the secretary&#39;s face.</p>
