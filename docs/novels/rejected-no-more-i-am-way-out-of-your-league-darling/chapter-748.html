                <p>As the final word echoed in the air, everyone&#39;s gaze snapped to the paper in question, their eyes alight with anticipation of Daniela&#39;s imminent disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles wore a smug grin, his voice dripping with condescension. &#34;Daniela, if you apologize now, I might still treat you with a shred of dignity. Otherwise, prepare for a spectacular downfall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Daniela folded her arms and retorted with icy calm, &#34;Really? I&#39;m rather eager to see that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles clenched his jaw, frustration mounting. &#34;We&#39;ll see how long you can maintain this facade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen interjected, &#34;Why even bother with pleasantries? Her arrogance is unbearable. Just reveal the results and let everyone see how clueless the former world&#39;s richest person truly is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles shot Daniela a piercing look before whispering sharply, &#34;You&#39;re mistaken this time. Our equipment is flawless-state of the art, unmatched worldwide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, frowning, pulled Charles aside. &#34;Why are you siding with an outsider? Do you think she&#39;s going to back you up? Come to your senses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran rolled his eyes, exasperated. &#34;Enough chatter! I&#39;m eager to see Daniela put in her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed, on the verge of retorting, but Daniela&#39;s subtle pull on his arm halted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to her, catching the slight shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists tightened in frustration, yet Daniela whispered, &#34;Hold on, let&#39;s just watch how this unfolds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Cedric quelled his rising ire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas eagerly summoned the cluster of reporters nearby, his voice booming with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gather around! Today, you&#39;ll witness the unveiling of our latest medical equipment, a creation solely nurtured by the McCoy family. It surpasses even our earlier innovations and is set to hit the market next</p>
                
                
                
                <p>week. Behold its debut and its unmatched precision!&#34; With a proud smile, Nikolas extended his hand to grasp the paper. &#34;This equipment represents the pinnacle of accuracy worldwide. The McCoy family has poured extensive effort and resources into it, with the vision of setting a new...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the results briefly and looked up with a triumphant grin.&#34;&#34;New standard for the industry! To become...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trailed off suddenly, the confidencein his expression faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if time had ground to a halt for Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth fell open, a look of utter astonishment washing over his face. His thoughts evaporated into a void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung heavy for a drawn-out moment, pierced only by the low buzz of puzzled whispers rippling through the crowd. Gradually, Nikolas&#39; gaze dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words on the paper in his grasp struck him like a thunderbolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The test confirmed the unthinkable: the two were father and son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word Nikolas had prepared was smothered by the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shook uncontrollably, his entire frame rigid with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That couldn&#39;t be real!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father and son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The equipment, a crowning achievement of the McCoy family, was supposed to be flawless. They had staked everything on its accuracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mix of defiance and despair, Nikolas nearly hurled the damning paper into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen intercepted him, his voice charged with excitement. &#34;This is the perfect moment to showcase our new technology to the press! Show them the results now!&#34; Damon eagerly backed him up. &#34;Exactly! Let Daniela have a taste of her own medicine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran added fuel to the fire. &#34;Absolutely! It&#39;s time to put Daniela and Cedric in their place and send them packing from Oiscoll!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the paper, Nikolas masked his anxiety with a taut smile. &#34;Here&#39;s the situation. It&#39;s time we put past conflicts behind us. The results are known amongst us, and there&#39;s no need for public spectacle. Even if Cedric is not a McCoy, he remains a player in the business arena. Let&#39;s not sever ties completely. We might find common ground in future endeavors. That&#39;s all for now. I appreciate the reporters, our friends, and family for your support. Let&#39;s remnember this is a family event and enjoy the remainder of our time together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was desperate to cover up the whole thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could intervene, Kohen cut in, incredulous. &#34;Hold on! Weren&#39;t you the one pushing for the DNA test? And now you want to just let it go? What&#39;s really happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles caught the undercurrents of tension and glanced instinctively at Daniela, who remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon drew Charles to one side, his voice a whisper but firm. &#34;Nikolas, why the hesitation? This is the perfect moment to topple Daniela. Reveal the results to everyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to seize the paper himself, Damon lunged forward. Nikolas sidestepped, evading Damon&#39;s grasp. However, he wasn&#39;t quick enough to escape Duran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a decisive motion, Duran snatched the paper and ascended a nearby chair. He grabbed the microphone, his voice resonating powerfully as he declared, &#34;The findings of this test confirm with a probability of 99.999% that the individuals in question are father and son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation thundered across the room, Duran&#39;s voice booming off the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock painted Duran&#39;s face as he re-examined the results. His head bowed, eyes scanning the words again -no error could be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conclusion was unequivocal-they were father and son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence enveloped the room. Then, all of a sudden, peals of laughter filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a cold glance at the group, arching an eyebrow. &#34;Who was it again who boasted they&#39;d humiliate me by slinging that results in my face? What did the results reveaI, exactly? Would you mind reciting them once more for everyone? This is the equipment that&#39;s supposed to set a new standard in the industry? It can&#39;t even differentiate between humans and animals. Are you really sure it&#39;s ready to be launched? Or..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, a sly smile creeping across her face. &#34;Or are we to believe that the lapdog over there might actually be a MAcCoy? Perhaps it&#39;s just a case of unusual genetics!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room burst into renewed laughter, while Nikolas seethed with rage.</p>
