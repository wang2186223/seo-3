                <p>Getting rid of Doug wasn&#39;t a tough challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was a man of strong sexual desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simply upping the dose of his medication before he slept with a woman would be enough to get the job done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real problem was the grudge burning inside Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That snake Natalie! Daring to take her man,fantasizing about marrying Doug, stealing everything she built?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce refused to let this slide; she&#39;d never allow it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lounged stiffly on the sofa, as Doug pawed at her eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed her gaze on the ceiling, eyes narrowing slightly.&#34;Darling,&#34; Joyce cooed, voice dripping with honey, &#34;I have a friend&#39;s birthday tomorrow. Will you join me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was well aware Doug rarely denied bed-time requests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she predicted, Doug nodded, trapped between desire and her teasing charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, before heading out, Joyce looped her arms around Doug&#39;s neck and grinned. &#34;Bring some of those pills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug, who normally found such gatherings dull,suddenly showed interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smirked. &#34;The spot today is super exclusive.I heard the elevator has mirrors everywhere. Baby,I wanna test it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Doug quickly dug into the drawer, grabbing two packs and shoving them into his pocket.Watching him, Joyce let out a soft chuckle and nudged his hand back into the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Doug pulled out five packs. Doug protested, &#34;These work wonders, but too many can put serious strain on my heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce leaned in close, whispering, &#34;Baby, I want to do something wild with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug,eyeing Joyce as she licked her lips, let out a laugh. &#34;I love how bold you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug took Joyce&#39;s hand and led her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got into the car, Doug turned to Joyce. &#34;Is Daniela coming today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shook her head. &#34;Not sure. Probably not.Daniela never cares for these types of gatherings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s expression darkened at her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between Joyce and Daniela, he&#39;d much rather indulge in a wild elevator rendezvous with the latter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of sleeping with Daniela felt like an unattainable fantasy turned real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before stepping out of the car, Doug&#39;s face hardened. &#34;Don&#39;t forget what I told you. I&#39;m dead serious. I poured a fortune into Alexander&#39;s surgery.If you fail to get Daniela into my bed, you can kiss your title as my wife goodbye. You&#39;ve got two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce bowed her head slightly, a flicker of cold malice flashing in her eyes. &#34;Alright, I got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hadn&#39;t anticipated Daniela&#39;s arrival let alone with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease washed over Joyce; Daniela&#39;s presence could throw her entire plan off course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Daniela remained seated, nibbling on the fruit Cedric offered, appearing as if she was merely there for the celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, you&#39;re related to Daniela. Do you have any idea why she decided to attend my birthday party?&#34;The birthday girl beamed with excitement. &#34;I barely know Daniela, but I took a chance and sent an invitation. I never thought she&#39;d actually come, let alone bring Cedric! This is a story I&#39;ll be bragging about forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, disinterested, cast a glance towards the entrance. &#34;Maybe Daniela got bored of baby preparations,&#34; she muttered, sounding distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl let out an excited giggle. &#34;Guess what?Daniela&#39;s birthday gift to me is a custom Elite Lux brooch! It&#39;s worth over half a million dollars online!|can&#39;t wait to show it off-everyone&#39;s going to be so jealous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce barely reacted,uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, what&#39;s got your attention?&#34; the grl inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one special, just waiting on someone,&#34; Joyce answered smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s stiff expression didn&#39;t ease until a poised figure stepped inside, allowing a faint hint of relief to cross her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned away, satisfied, only to lock eyes with Daniela, who sat quietly in the corner, nibbling on a small cake with a faint, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s heart lurched in surprise. Steeling herself,she approached Daniela cautiously. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply continued eating her cherry tomatoes,offering no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Daniela, whatever happens today has nothing to do with you. Stay out of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded casually, &#34;I&#39;m just here to enjoy myself.Carry on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s words, Joyce&#39;s nerves eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Daniela wasn&#39;t the type to lie.Yet having Daniela see through her so easily was irritating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding it wasn&#39;t worth arguing, Joyce shifted her focus, her gaze landing on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wore a dress that exuded both elegance and grace, its hem rippling like a glistening stream beneath the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Natalie stepped in, Joyce caught Doug&#39;s eyes locked onto her. Joyce scoffed, observing the scene with icy indifference.</p>
