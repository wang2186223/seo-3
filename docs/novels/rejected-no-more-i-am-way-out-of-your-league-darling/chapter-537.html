                <p>Daniela laughed lightly. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you&#39;d all agree on this. Bruno it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno was the second most powerful figure in the commerce association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raised in poverty, he relied on borrowed money to complete his education. When the internet boom hit,he was among the first to seize the opportunity,securing his initial fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He later married into an influential family in the tech industry, using his father-in-law&#39;s connections to ascend the social ranks quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his father-in-law&#39;s passing, the old man entrusted the internet company to his daughter-Bruno&#39;s wife. But within a few years, Bruno manipulated events, stripping his wife of control and claiming the company for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he solidified his position, he discarded his wife without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Bruno had masterminded a horrifying event-having a group of men raping his wife,leaving  her emotionally shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next day, she had taken her own life, leaving behind one chilling statement-Bruno would pay for his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years went by,yet Bruno continued to rise, backed by Hackett&#39;s support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno once smugly declared on camera, &#34;Justice? It doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s just another luxury for the wealthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having clawed his way up from nothing, Bruno had no qualms about resorting to dishonorable tactics. He valued money more than anyone else in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when Cedric demanded a hundred billion,Bruno was the first to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight remained seated in the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno slammed his fist on the table. &#34;Are you all just going to sit there while Cedric walks all over us? I&#39;m telling you, a hundred billion dollars would ruin me!Forget it-I&#39;m not handing over another cent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett sighed,his brows furrowing. &#34;Bruno, you&#39;re as impulsive asever. We haven&#39;t even decided if we&#39;ll pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Bruno planted his hands on his hips. &#34;We have to get rid of Cedric. I&#39;ve had enough of his arrogance.No one has dared challenge me like this in years. It&#39;s  infuriating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno grabbed his glass and downed the water in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow, leaning back, spoke with quiet composure.&#34;If you ask me, just pay and move on. Whether we like it or not, Daniela is recognized as the world&#39;s richest person. A hundred billion is a steep price, but with new members constantly joining the association, we&#39;ll make it back in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow wasn&#39;t like the others. He had crossed paths with Elite Lux before. He didn&#39;t know them personally,but he recognized that Daniela wasn&#39;t just there as Cedric&#39;s plus-one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Winslow, if you&#39;re just going to bow down, then keep quiet!&#34; Bruno spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow might&#39;ve been ranked lowest among them,but he was the most calculated. When he spoke,there was usually a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett shot Winslow a hesitant look, reluctant to part with such a large sum. &#34;Why don&#39;t we hold off a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow gave a casual shrug before standing up. &#34;I won&#39;t argue. If we&#39;re paying, just give me a heads-up so I can plan accordingly. But if you&#39;re thinking of going against Daniela or Cedric, don&#39;t count me in. I&#39;ve  got family obligations, so I&#39;m out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno scowled at Winslow&#39;s retreating figure, seething.&#34;Spineless coward! It&#39;s just Daniela! What&#39;s there to fear? Look at him scurrying away like he&#39;s being hunted! Afraid of a woman? Pathetic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett ran a frustrated hand through his hair.&#34;Enough about Daniela-she&#39;s irrelevant. Cedric is the real problem here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others murmured in agreement and launched into quiet deliberation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno headed back to his newly acquired villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By his side was his latest conquest-a second-rate celebrity barely clinging to fame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exuded a captivating, seductive energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Bruno was about to indulge, his phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, he picked up. &#34;This better be important!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary&#39;s frantic voice crackled through the line.&#34;Mr. Deleon! We&#39;ve had several major order cancellations tonight! You might need to come immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the woman close, Bruno scoffed, &#34;So what?  The company&#39;s thriving, and our new game is about to drop. A few cancellations aren&#39;t the end of the world.Stop overreacting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s secretary stared in horror at the crashing player count for the new game, his anxiety mounting with each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare call again, opting instead to flood Bruno&#39;s inbox with updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno,too preoccupied,ignored his phone the entire night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleepless secretary watched the game&#39;s numbers nosedive, a sinking sense of doom settlingin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five billion dollars had been poured into this game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was supposed to be their gateway into the international market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with such dismal engagement, they&#39;d have to give it away for free just to get players.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Bruno finally showed up at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crowd had formed outside his office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tech,marketing, and PR teams were all clustered  anxiously outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is this?&#34; Bruno eyed his secretary&#39;s exhausted face and sneered. &#34;You look like the world&#39;s ending. What&#39;s with the long face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, the secretary lifted his gaze to meet Bruno&#39;s.</p>
