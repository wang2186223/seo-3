                <p>Alexander made his way back to the country without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the flight, he frequently glanced at his own reflection in a small hand mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A certain flight attendant appeared to be observing him intently. When Alexander gave her a disapproving look, she approached without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes, wide and gleaming with admiration, revealed her excitement. &#34;Mr. Phillips! Is it really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander came to the startling realization that the flight attendant had confused him with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t help but take silent pleasure in the misplaced admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside his mirror, he straightened his posture. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.Do you know me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; she replied, struggling to modulate her excitement. &#34;I&#39;m your biggest fan. I&#39;ve seen your interviews on the financial channel so many times. It&#39;s unfortunate you&#39;ve stopped appearing on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed smile, Alexander responded, &#34;Work has kept me quite busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flight attendant nodded,her gaze still fixed on Alexander with shameless admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others on the flight began to take notice, casting appreciative looks in Alexander&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander received exemplary service for the rest of the flight. Upon landing, the flight attendant requested his autograph and even left her contact details, hopeful for further interactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight grin, Alexander handed her a piece of paper with Cedric&#39;s contact information and left the airport in high spirits,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the flight attendant sent Cedric a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Cedric, could I use your phone to set up a new game account?&#34; Ryan asked, just as Cedric was peeling an orange for Daniela. Without pausing his task, Cedric passed his phone to Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ryan unlocked the device, a message notification caught his attention. Curiosity got the better of him,and he tapped on it. A photo loaded on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela finished eating the orange, Ryan was still in the same position, holding the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan gave no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave him a gentle push, and Ryan finally turned to face Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, busy fitting socks on Daniela, remarked, &#34;It&#39;s chilly. You need to wear socks. Let&#39;s head upstairs now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela resisted, shaking her head, but Cedric picked her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, he said, &#34;Ryan,hand over the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan passed the phone to Cedric, his eyes never straying from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of Ryan&#39;s intense stare, Cedric focused solely on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, after tending to his own needs, Cedric entered the room to find Daniela already asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric placed his hand under the blanket, touching Daniela&#39;s side tenderly, his voice rough with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have you been so tired lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela often dozed off while watching TV on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I go with you to the hospital tomorrow?&#34; he offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning over with a lazy sigh, Daniela murmured, &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed, pressing his body closer, and a faint smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips as she slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Ryan utilized his hacking skills to gain access to Cedric&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baffled, Lillian asked,&#34;What are you up to?&#34; Ryan squinted and swiveled the computer screen to show Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A suggestive photo came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the photo, a woman posed in a sheer, see-through top paired with black stockings, with just enough coverage to leave little to the imagination. It was the kind of image that could make any man&#39;s face flush with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the image was a provocative message. &#34;Mr. Phillips, do you like what you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian paused, digesting the image and text, and said, &#34;It&#39;s not shocking. Cedric&#39;s high profile might attract such advances from women attempting to seduce him. It should...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was cut off by another alert on Cedric&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new message appeared. &#34;Mr. Phillips, you complimented my figure on our last flight and expressed a desire to know me better. I&#39;m available these days, Shall we arrange a meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, another message arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The news mentioned your upcoming business trip to Alveranna in three days.Coincidentally, my flight also lands there then. If you&#39;re occupied now, I eagerly anticipate our encounter overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Ryan&#39;s and Lillian&#39;s expressions grew increasingly concerned as they read on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another image surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the photo, the woman adopted a provocative stance, clutching a paper to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian looked closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s name was clearly inscribed on the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s anger flared immediately, and she was about to confront Cedric when Ryan restrained her. &#34;Should we watch a bit longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, the flight attendant endured a long night. Just as she was losing hope,the doorbell echoed unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week later, a scandal erupted as the top story online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Sleeping with Fans!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A video surfaced showing a flight attendant, her ID in hand, tearfully addressing the viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi everyone, I work for Chaubray Airlines. Today, I must expose Cedric Phillips, CEO of Phillips Group, for deserting me after a brief affair. Our encounter began with love at first sight on a flight, leading to three passionate days in a hotel, after which he vanished. Given his influential position, I feel powerless and seek only justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the same day, images of Daniela and Cedric en route to the hospital appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Phillips Group&#39;s PR team attempted to suppress the rising scandal, rival firms fueled the fire, amplifying the allegations against them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to enter the consultation room, Ryan burst in, phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, the scandal is spiraling. The attendant is now making rounds on the media circuit. I planned a discreet meeting with her, but she&#39;s now under the custody of the commerce association. They&#39;re protecting her, and she&#39;s becoming bolder, making the digital backlash quite severe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated at the door of the consultation room, then stepped back. &#34;Let&#39;s head back to the company first.&#34;</p>
