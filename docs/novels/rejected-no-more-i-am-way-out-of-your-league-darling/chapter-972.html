                <p>Carol peered at the color-drained expressions of the individuals across from her and let out a dismissive chuckle,lips curled into a smug grin. &#34;Everyone must take responsibility for their actions. Josh does,and so do,you! There&#39;s no escaping fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Carol flashed a frosty grin and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining trio kept their eyes glued to the bank card clutched in Ethan&#39;s grasp, unmoving. Something about this card brought a wave of heavy discomfort over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela came back from her lunch, she discovered the McCoy brothers still rooted at her doorway,appearing as though they&#39;d seen a ghost.The scene was equally laughable and pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paid them no mind and proceeded straight into her workspace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, they noticed a familiar figure-Josh&#39;s wife. Wearing a charcoal ensemble and a matching facial cover, she moved past the McCoy brothers as if they were invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, can I divorce Josh now?&#34; Victoria McCoy inquired, her tone devoid of hope, her features sunken &#34;Another minute around him feels unbearable! Just thinking about him makes my skin crawl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed the fatigue beneath Victoria&#39;s eyes and responded with composure, &#34;Is this decision final?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Droplets cascaded down Victoria&#39;s cheeks. &#34;What choice do I have? I know Josh inside out. He&#39;s calculating and self-centered! Now that the facts are public, he&#39;ll start shifting wealth and shielding everything. I&#39;ll be left destitute. This morning,I caught a glimpse of the six daughters he shares with his lover.The oldest is beyond Mason in age. Josh tied the knot with me for status and leverage. It explains why after the honeymoon phase, he never stayed in the same bed again, which is why I only have Mason. I once blamed myself for the coldness between us, but now I realize he had an entire secret life. I must ensure he walks away empty-handed. I won&#39;t forgive him-or her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria appealed to Daniela, &#34;Please assist me, Ms.Harper. Once those assets are mine, I&#39;ll sell everything to you and disappear from Oiscoll for good. I want no more memories of this misery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Very well, sign this arrangement contract. Tomorrow, a legal representative will arrive at your residence to begin the official divorce procedure.&#34; Gratitude poured from Victoria&#39;s lips. &#34;May I address you as Daniela? Thank you so much. Without your help, I&#39;d still be trapped in ignorance, and my future would&#39;ve been ruined!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a restrained smile. &#34;This benefits us both. No need for appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria understood that someone with Daniela&#39;s capabilities could&#39;ve easily exposed Josh to the media and destroyed his standing-but she chose not to, out of empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Daniela had proven her previous words true -girls help girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Victoria was about to step out, Daniela hesitated briefly. Once Victoria neared the exit,Daniela suddenly called out, &#34;Mrs. McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoia halted and turned toward Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a piece of advice. &#34;From this moment forward,do not return to your home.Leave everything behind. I&#39;ll arrange a temporary home for you until everything is resolved. Then I&#39;ll see to it you leave Oiscoll without difficulty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria recognized the concern in Daniela&#39;s gesture.She nodded and replied with a faint smile, &#34;Fine,I&#39;ll go along with your plan. I never want to cross that doorstep again.&#34; Daniela acknowledged her response,feeling reassured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at Daniela and said warmly, &#34;The next time our paths cross, I&#39;ll no longer be Josh&#39;s partner.Just call me Victoria-that&#39;s who l am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled in return. &#34;Certainly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria exited peacefully, refusing to acknowledge the McCoy brothers waiting nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the three finally stepped inside, they caught Daniela instructing Carol, &#34;Assign a team to shadow Victoria and protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked in disbelief. &#34;But once she&#39;s in the house we arranged, Josh won&#39;t be able to reach her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a breath, gently placing her hand on her belly, and murmured, &#34;You&#39;ve never experienced motherhood, Carol,so you wouldn&#39;t understand. The strongest emotion in existence is a mother&#39;s devotion.It fuels you, yet it can be the thing that breaks you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that point, Carol didn&#39;t quite grasp what Daniela meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply did as asked and coordinated a security detail for Victoria&#39;s protection.</p>
