                <p>Chapter, one that hadn&#39;t resurfaced in years. Yet,now..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because of Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had never anticipated Cedric&#39;s influence on Daniela would be so profound. It had never been about curing depression-it was about keeping it in check, knowing it would always come and go. The moment emotions spiraled,the symptoms found their way back. It all showed in the symptoms-proof that emotions weren&#39;t just in the mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Just a minor thing,&#34; Daniela insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s brow furrowed with concern. &#34;Did something happen at Phillips Group today? Did Cedric say something to upset you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers caressed her numb palm as she reached for her phone, her expression veiled and unreadable. &#34;No. What could he possibly say to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Lillian considered it, but she knew Cedric wasn&#39;t the type to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as they arrived at the charity event that evening and glimpsed the figure in the red dress standing beside Cedric,both Daniela and Lillian froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury ignited within Lillian, propelling her forward with fiery resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela was rooted to the spot, her reaction stifled by shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her world narrowed to the sight of Cedric, standing beside him Lydia-the undeniable center of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dia was radiant her allure magnified hv the vivid red dress clinging to her curves. She leaned towards Cedric, her head tilted in a gesture of intimate familiarity, her every word dripping with an effortless.seductive charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood regally, his silhouette sharply tailored in a custom-made suit, cradling a glass of wine. A faint smile played at the corners of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, clutching her purse as if it were a lifeline,felt the room suddenly tighten around her. Her breath became shallow; the whispers and stares of the gathered elite felt suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze seemed magnetically drawn to her and Cedric-this was the kind of drama the high society thrived on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all remembered Cedric&#39;s protective aura around her,and now, here he stood, barely a year into their marriage,with another woman by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the elite, ravenous for the latest tale of intrigue.this was a feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s world narrowed to Cedric alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied his subtly curved lips, her grip on her purse tightening involuntarily, her heart drumming a frantic rhythm before she forced her fingers to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, with a flare of protective fury, broke through the crowd and yanked Lydia from Cedric&#39;s side.&#34;Cedric, this is too much! After your argument with Daniela, did she try to make amends? Quarrel all you want, but why involve a third party? Do you know she 一</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian,&#34; Daniela interjected as she approached and pulled Lillian back. Her right hand trembled slightly as she gripped her purse, the movement so subtle that only a keen eye would catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, Lillian,&#34; Daniela whispered. &#34;There are reporters all around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters didn&#39;t matter to Daniela. The only thing on her mind was Cedric and his Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside Cedric, Lydia appraised the woman known as the richest in the world with keen interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s beauty was effortless, her complexion radiant even without a hint of makeup. Her eyes,particularly striking, shone with a clarity that was both rare and enviable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Ms. Harper. I&#39;m Lydia Vargas.&#34; Lydia greeted her with a calculated casualness, extending her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian tensed, her gaze sharpening, as if she were about to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela stopped her with a gentle touch,accepting Lydia&#39;s handshake with a warm, disarming smile. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. That&#39;s a stunning dress you&#39;re wearing tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia returned the smile. &#34;Thank you. Mr. Phillips chose it for me; he believes red is my color.&#34; Daniela nodded, her response dripping with grace. &#34;It certainly is. If you&#39;ll excuse me, I must be going. Enjoy your evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia watched her go, a flicker of surprise crossing her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t thought it would go this way. Daniela stayed composed, unruffled, and completely unfazed by the provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed a few sharp words would break Daniela&#39;s composure, provoking Daniela to snap at her so that Cedric would feel bad for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This caught her completely off guard.</p>
