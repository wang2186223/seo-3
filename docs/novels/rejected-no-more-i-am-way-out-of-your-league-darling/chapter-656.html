                <p>A few mninutes later, the rumble of a car engine echoed up from downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ascended the stairs wearily, her footsteps resonating faintly. Carol peeked from her room and asked cautiously, &#34;Wasn&#39;t that a bit too harsh? You won&#39;t cry in your room later, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply and went straight to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spent the whole night gathering information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning,it was raining heavily outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky was covered as if a vast curtain had been drawn across it, darkening the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela descended the stairs, even Jack hesitated to approach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A somber mood hung over the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce murmured to Caiden, &#34;Daniela is so irritable now.No one wants to upset her.&#34; It seemed a risk to life to irritate Daniela at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden agreed with a nervous nod, saying,&#34;We better keep our distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned to Elite Lux, readying for the upcoming season&#39;s fashion show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time,she was causing a real commotion,signaling to everyone the dramatic return of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was set on regaining everything she had once lost,no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s reputation made many in the elite circles disregard her inability to have children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several individuals,like Alexander,attempted to forge a connection with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, usually composed, grew concerned when he learned that his friend&#39;s son was attempting to get close to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was a walking treasure. This time, he was determined to not let anyone else seize the opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He promptly called Alexander, but the call went unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s anxiety increased. and he sent Alexander many voice messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, what are you up to? Why aren&#39;t you picking up? Do you realize someone else is pursuing Daniela? How much longer will you stay overseas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is surgery really that complicated? Once you&#39;re finished, come back quickly. What will we do if Daniela chooses someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has set up a sensational nationwide show this time. Just look at the trending topics-they&#39;re all about Elite Lux! Even Eternity Glory, which split off from Elite Lux, is being overshadowed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander! You need to return and win Daniela back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s messages repeated over and over in the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander held his phone tightly, his gaze filled with dark and vengeful determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his fist struck the mirror, breaking it into fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was furious and stormed out to confront the plastic surgeon. &#34;What did you promise me earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pointed to his face and added, &#34;You promised you were a professional, that you could make my face look just like it did before. I&#39;ve paid over eighty million. Does this look the same to you?&#34; The surgeon apologized, saying, &#34;Mr. Bennett, the injuries to your face were severe. Recovery takes time,as human skin has its limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was not interested in excuses. &#34;How long will it take? Don&#39;t you know I have urgent business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon smiled and held up three fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes and asked, &#34;Three days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon shook his head, still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Thirty days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon let out a soft laugh. &#34;No,it&#39;s thirty years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was shocked, nearly collapsing. &#34;Thirty years? Might as well wait until I&#39;m dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon responded with a touch of humor,&#34;Cosmetic surgery is for the living, not the dead. If you&#39;re unhappy with my work, feel free to visit another clinic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Alexander quickly arranged his discharge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away, the assistant asked, puzzled,&#34;Are we really just letting him leave like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon smiled knowingly and said, &#34;He&#39;ll return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The injuries were too severe for a quick fix. Once Alexander realized he had no alternatives, he would come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In thirty years, nobody would recall today&#39;s conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant nodded,understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, no one else dared to treat Alexander like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressured by Richard, Alexander decided to head home first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his plane&#39;s arrival, Alexander was informed that Daniela was to attend a banquet that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home and get ready. Put on a new outfit,&#34; Richard instructed as he looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A piercing scream rang through the Bennett family&#39;s household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face was filled with shock as he stared at Alexander,asking, &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander closed his eyes for a moment. &#34;Dad, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,taken aback, scrutinized the figure before him repeatedly to confirm it was indeed Alexander.&#34;What your face restored? Why do you still look so awful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was disappointed. &#34;You&#39;re going to the banquet looking like this? How could Daniela possibly notice you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw and said, &#34;Cedric has a limp, and he still meets Daniela. Why can&#39;t l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Richard took another look at Alexander&#39;s disfigured face. &#34;But your face is horrifying! My goodness! It unsettles me. Don&#39;t go tonight. You&#39;ll only upset people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned and said,&#34;Dad,what do you mean?Aren&#39;t you supporting me? Don&#39;t you believe I can win Daniela over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Alexander decided against attending the banquet. He was acutely aware of his dreadful appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He merely wanted to catch a glimpse of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a brief look would suffice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he didn&#39;t see Daniela; instead, he encountered Joyce.</p>
