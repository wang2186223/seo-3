                <p>Natalie quickly checked the balance inher account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after adding Elyse&#39;s money, their total assets barely reached five million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she handed over three million,only two million was left-an amount that, in her world, wouldn&#39;t even cover the cost of a decent evening gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the financial strain, she turned to Elyse and asked, &#34;Mom, it&#39;s time to use your savings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was referring to the shares Daniela had given Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux was massive-its dividends alone were enough to support a lavish lifestyle for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression turned to shock. &#34;Every penny I have is right here. What savings? Natalie, I barely recognize you these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, their heated argument escalated like never before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware,they were being watched by a pair of cold,calculating eyes,silently taking in everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rhe next day. Lillian was playing a game on her phono.  while chatting with Daniela. &#34;Natalie is desperate to get rid of you. She&#39;s selling designer bags at a flea market just to scrape together three million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, letting out a low chuckle &#34;I suppose I should thank her for the effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later, Natalie stared at her almost empty account and took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With resolve, she transferred the money to Russell and called him. &#34;Hey, the three million&#39;s been sent.Check it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell, busy with a game of cards,responded lazily,&#34;Alright, let me see... Yep, three million dollars received.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to press him to take action,Russell&#39;s indifferent voice came through. &#34;So, when are you sending the remaining three million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Natalie nearly shouted, &#34;I just sent you three million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s tone remained casual. &#34;Yeah, but the rest of the payment is still missing. You think we don&#39;t charge interest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was floored. &#34;Interest? Since when? And why should you make so much money for doing nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell nodded as he replied, &#34;The terms in the contract are straightforward. Didn&#39;t you read it? If the principal isn&#39;t paid in full, interest is charged on the  whole amount. For a hundred million,three million in interest isn&#39;t that big of a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie froze, her eyes scanning the contract in disbelief. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll just find someone else! Give my money back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell was blunt, his tone cold. &#34;Sure, I&#39;ll deduct a hefty processing fee of $50 million and send the rest back to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s heart sank. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of cards shuffling on the other end of the Hne abruptly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bone-chilling silence followed, and then a deadly.low voice responded, &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Natalie&#39;s spine.&#34;I mean once the three million is transferred, you&#39;ll kill Daniela,right?There won&#39;t be any more charges,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of cards shuffling resumed on the other end, as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s response was almost casual. &#34;Of course.We&#39;re professionals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie ended the call quickly, her mind racing. To avoid more interest, she sold off both her and Elyse&#39;s cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, on the edge of tears, couldn&#39;t keep her distress in check.&#34;Mom,stop crying!&#34; Natalie snapped, her patience thin &#34;It&#39;s so annoying! Once Daniela is gone, we&#39;ll have everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and desperate, she called Russell once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s voice was laid-back as ever. &#34;Alright, full payment&#39;s in. Just wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huge sigh of relief escaped Natalie. &#34;So, how soon will Daniela be gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said, we&#39;re professionals. Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll happen soon enough,&#34; he responded wvithout a hint of urgency</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Natalie smiled with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, however, was troubled, her brow furrowed.Daniela had already assured her of everything she desired. Yet, after all this chaos, she had lost her favorite car and was still stewing over the villa that had been sold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Natalie&#39;s profile, feeling more cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her then-Natalie wasn&#39;t as easily manipulated as she had thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela entered a charity auction,and as soon as she arrived, the lights dimmed. Someone quietly took a seat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nudged Daniela,her voice curious. &#34;Daniela, why is Cedric here?&#34;Daniela, eyes glued to her phone,responded without looking up, &#34;He had a signing ceremony this afternoon He shouldn&#39;t be here in Olisvine right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned over the seat to get a better look.&#34;Huh?Isn&#39;t that Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued typing away on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked up, the man in the front row stood and made his way towards the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her angle, she could now clearly see the man resembled Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian spun to Daniela, wide-eyed. &#34;Isn&#39;t that him?Why is Cedric here? Why didn&#39;t he tell you he was coming? He knows we&#39;re here at the auction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood up and was ready to greet him but froze when she saw him walk past everyone and sit next to Joyce in the front row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth fell open in surprise. She turned to Daniela,shocked. &#34;When did Cedric get so close to Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers buzzed through the room as Lillian and Daniela looked up to see &#34;Cedric&#34; leaning in.whispering intimately to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Daniela and Cedric were well-known figures in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not too long ago, Daniela had made a public announcement about her marriage to Cedric, and  everyone knew how deeply he adored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how could he suddenly be so close to Joyce of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore,everyone in the room turned their gaze from &#34;Cedric&#34; to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right there, and &#34;Cedric&#34; had been caught in the act,leaning intimately with Joyce.</p>
