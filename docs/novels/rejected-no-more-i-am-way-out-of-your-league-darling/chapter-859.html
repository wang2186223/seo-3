                <p>Daniela was on her way back from the hospital when she saw Cedric near the company building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with everything on Cedric&#39;s plate, he was standing there,waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her car approached, Cedric walked toward it. &#34;Did you visit the hospital?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grinned. &#34;Yeah. I saw someone wrapped up like a mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a scoff. &#34;That&#39;s what caught your attention?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped out, took his hand, and they walked inside together. Her light laugh chased away whatever jealousy he might have been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Daniela had barely stepped into the lobby when Kohen came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike his last visit, this time, Kohen wore a tailored suit that gave him a touch of class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s eyes flicked to Daniela&#39;s and Cedric&#39;s hands,lingering there before he forced a polite smile. &#34;Hello.&#34; Cedric&#39;s expression darkened the moment he heard Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Daniela. &#34;Go and eat something.It&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen tried to follow, but Cedric lifted a hand,blocking him with no expression at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen had clearly been waiting for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed distant, but talking to her wasn&#39;t hard.Cedric, on the other hand, was impossible. There was no way to break through that wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Kohen could do was stand there and watch Daniela leave. &#34;If you&#39;ve got something to say, then say it to me,&#34; Cedric said, his voice steady and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hesitated, then muttered, &#34;So, she listens to you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;For minor things, I decide. This sounds minor. Say what you need to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen felt a bit intimidated by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a ruthless person Cedric was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had broken every bone in Alexander&#39;s body. And the pain-Kohen didn&#39;t even want to imagine it. Kohen had always known Cedric was harsh. But after seeing what happened to Alexander, he was too scared to act impulsively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Alexander step down?&#34; Kohen tried to keep his voice steady. &#34;I&#39;m managing the branch company&#39;s business now. Cedric, you&#39;re part of the McCoy family too. Father once wanted to pass everything to you.Isn&#39;t this too much? You&#39;ve almost drained the branch company. Isn&#39;t that going too far? What about Father&#39;s dignity? If you keep pushing like this,don&#39;t expect to be welcomed back into the family. Return what you took. If you do that, I&#39;ll speak on your behalf.Father and the board will listen. Sound fair to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen lifted his chin as he spoke, his eyes filled with smugness and pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol considered slapping him but held back because of the crowd. She didn&#39;t want to draw the wrong kind of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not everyone cared about appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Kohen&#39;s face hit the thick glass with a loud thud. The impact left him dazed. Everyone nearby froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol popped her lollipop out of her mouth. &#34;Whoa,&#34;she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment made headlines that very day. Kohen had been slammed into glass in full view of the public. It wasn&#39;t a good look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When reporters asked Cedric about it, he smoothed down his jacket and looked at the camera. &#34;Fighting in public isn&#39;t right. But I couldn&#39;t stop myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen held his cheek and shouted, &#34;This wasn&#39;t a fight! You just hit me for no reason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary pushed up his glasses. &#34;You&#39;re free to file a lawsuit if you want. But we&#39;ll defend ourselves fully. And we also have the right to sue you for spreading lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of Kohen&#39;s failed provocation spread like wildfire in business circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at him, eyes narrowed. &#34;Are you seriously this useless? You couldn&#39;t handle one simple task? What else am I supposed to expect from you?You and Cedric-same blood,totally different. Tell me who I can count on in this family now. I told you to approach Daniela quietly. You were supposed to get her to convince Cedric to ease up on the branch company.But what did you do instead? I watched the whole thing from the window. Your smug face made my hand itch. Now everyone knows you begged for mercy and got beaten up instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton raised his hand and struck Kohen across the  face.&#34;What excuse am I supposed to use to clean this up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen elutched his cheek,his eyes burning with rage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option,he shoved down his pride and went to look for Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of Daniela,Kohen ran right into Cedric again</p>
