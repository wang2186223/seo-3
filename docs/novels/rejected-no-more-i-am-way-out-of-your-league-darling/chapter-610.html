                <p>Alexander caught the sharp gaze Cedric locked onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of satisfaction coursed through him at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric might have been powerful, but the title of the country&#39;s richest man now belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric might have loved Daniela deeply, but after three long years, he found her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t grasp why even Cedric believed Daniela was gone, but this time, he had found her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like a decade ago, it was Daniela who had taken the first step towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he would take every opportunity and ensure Cedric had no chance to turn the tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought sent a wave of exhilaration through Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smug smile, he strode towards Cedric. &#34;Hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained unreadable; he didn&#39;t spare Alexander a single glance. Alexander wasn&#39;t the least bit shaken by Cedric&#39;s coldness. &#34;All these years and you&#39;re still just as impossible. Daniela must have had a hard time dealing with you when she was alive. Three years have passed -she wouldn&#39;t hold it against you for moving on.You&#39;re still young. Maybe it&#39;s time to start living for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a light chuckle.&#34;Or maybe you should tell me your type. I&#39;d be happy to set you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Cedric finally turned his head, his gaze settling on Alexander&#39;s self-satisfied expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then spoke in a voice as cold as ice.&#34;What exactly are you so pleased about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s words caught Alexander off guard. He blinked.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scoffed. &#34;Has no one ever told you not to wear your emotions on your sleeve? What&#39;s got you so thrilled? Or are you trying to rub something in my face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief second, Alexander stiffened, as if Cedric had peeled away his mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly in that fleeting silence.&#34;Alexander, if I ever find out you put up a tombstone for my wife without my permission and kept it hidden,I&#39;ll personally ensure you lose everything-starting with your title as the country&#39;s richest man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat in Cedric&#39;s voice was unmistakable-undiluted and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So blatant, in fact, that Alexander found himself momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after Cedric had been gone for some time did Alexander finally let out the breath he&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that he realized-buried beneath his tangled emotions was a sliver of fear. A wry smnile tugged at his lips as he watched Cedric&#39;s retreating figure, a curse slipping from his mouth. &#34;You won&#39;t be smug for much longer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped out of the banquet hall, pausing at the entrance as he lit a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary followed closely behind, but Cedric didn&#39;t even glance his way. &#34;Watch Alexander closely.Something about him doesn&#39;t sit right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That air of superiority was the same as when Daniela had first divorced him-back when he was still chasing after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded. &#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric slipped into the car, yet it remained idle. His gaze stayed locked on the banquet entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hesitated before speaking carefully. &#34;Sir,the doctor said your leg has only just started to regain sensation. You should get some rest; it&#39;s already past ten. I&#39;ll have someone keep an eye on things here Why don&#39;t you head back? If anything happens, I&#39;ll notify you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat motionless in the back seat, his cold stare never wavering from the banquet entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than thirty minutes later, Alexander finally emerged from the banquet and stepped into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was low and firm. &#34;Follow him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the drive, Cedric gave another order.&#34;Find out where Alexander&#39;s flying to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat later, the secretary responded, &#34;Fiarantian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows knitted together before he issued his next command. &#34;Prepare my private jet. We leave for Fiarantian in thirty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary blinked, momentarily stunned.&#34;Alexander&#39;s company has been handling multiple deals lately-he&#39;s been flying all over. Are you really going to chase a gut feeling? And your leg...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent. The secretary exhaled a quiet sigh of resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Daniela&#39;s death in the fire three years ago.followed by Ryan and Lillian vanishing, Cedric had been a ghost of himself. He no longer seemed to care about anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>NNot the company. Not even himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary often thought Cedric might have ended it all just to reunite with Daniela-if not for his duty to his grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His leg was only beginning to recover, yet he treated it as if it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he be so reckless with his own health?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he kept this up, he would slowly wither away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like flowers abandoned in a forgotten garden, left to wither from neglect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been fading away for three long years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Alexander stepped off the plane, he hurried straight to the address his secretary had provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric trailed close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His leg was still weak, and Alexander was moving fast.But Cedric, unwilling to lose sight of him, pushed himself to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Cedric in his current disheveled state, the secretary&#39;s eyes welled with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, he had a perfect family. Now, it lay in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a vast flower field in Fiarantian, Carol Blake,Daniela&#39;s subordinate, hurried after Daniela, her voice laced with concern. &#34;Daniela, you just woke up. You really shouldn&#39;t be wandering around like this. Let&#39;s go back. Dr. Aston already chewed me out! He said if l don&#39;t bring you back soon, he&#39;ll come drag you back himself. You know how relentless he is. If he catches you this time, slipping away again won&#39;t be so easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s go. I divorced Alexander,cracked my head open, and spent three years in a coma. Now that I&#39;m finally awake, I barely get a few days to enjoy myself before they start reeling me back in. Dr. Aston&#39;s just overly diligent about my health,that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;The car&#39;s waiting outside.&#34; But inwardly, she corrected Daniela-it had been more than three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They climbed into the car and reached the airport thirty minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved through the terminal, a figure rushed past,accidentally colliding with Daniela. &#34;Sorry,&#34; the stranger muttered, steadying her briefly before disappearing without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instinctively turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did the back of that figure look so much like Alexander&#39;s?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned, her breath hitched-standing right before her was Cedric. His eyes shimmered with unshed tears, his expression a storm of emotions too raw to hide.</p>
