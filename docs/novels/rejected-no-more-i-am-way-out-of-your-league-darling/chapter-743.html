                <p>Charles was taken aback. &#34;You didn&#39;t secure a prenup with Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked in disbelief, trying to make sense of the revelation. &#34;Daniela, this could cost you dearly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Daniela understood well that heirs to substantial fortunes typically ensured their interests were meticulously arranged before marriage. This usually involved detailed negotiations and signing comprehensive legal documents to protect family assets before even considering marriage registration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This approach primarily served to protect the assets of the rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone assumed Daniela held the advantage in her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, lacking a prenup meant that, in the event of a divorce, Cedric could claim a significant share of her wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Phillips Group, which Cedric managed,paled in comparison to Daniela&#39;s Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re usually so intelligent, but this seems like a major oversight,&#34; Charles couldn&#39;t resist commenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Daniela remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles grew more worried. &#34;You&#39;re serious, aren&#39;t you? How could you even consider divorcing Cedric without a prenuptial agreement? That would be madness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coolly, &#34;If he insists, I&#39;ll concede the assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was dumbfounded, momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced to the villa, where Cedric was engrossed in his phone, and whispered to Daniela, &#34;After your divorce, do you plan to remarry? Could you ever see yourself with someone like me?&#34; Daniela responded with a sarcastic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles tightened his lips, accepting the unlikelihood of a relationship with her. &#34;But you&#39;ll still support me,correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s merely a partnership of convenience,&#34; Daniela clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded in understanding. &#34;My father will announce his retirement from McCoy Group at next week&#39;s board meeting. He&#39;ll introduce the new CEO then. We have just one week left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded back, her demeanor as cool and measured as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles found Daniela&#39;s independence and secrecy infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible to predict her moves or influence her decisions. She appeared all-knowing, yet she shared nothing, compelling others to merely execute her commands without ever being true partners in her schemes. This feeling of powerlessness reminded him of his past frustrations with Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Daniela evoked the same sense of helplessness in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of Daniela&#39;s sight, Charles&#39; expression hardened,his eyes flashing with a menacing resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He concluded that Daniela was too dangerous to be left unchecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He detested being a pawn in someone else&#39;s game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, he decided it was time to take matters into his own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cedric saw everything within the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Charles departed, Cedric hurried to Daniela&#39;s side. &#34;Charles is a problem. He&#39;s not reliable and won&#39;t be easy to control,&#34; he warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela began ascending the stairs, tired from the day&#39;s events, Cedric stepped in front of her,blocking her way.  Without missing a beat, she responded, &#34;His obedience isn&#39;t necessary. I only need a valid pretext to infiltrate McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Charles became the new CEO of McCoy Group,she could join the group as a technical consultant.Whether Charles ultimately secured his position as the successor didn&#39;t matter to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, clearly concerned. &#34;And once you join McCoy Group, what then? What if Charles turns on you after securing his ambitions and stops cooperating? You need dependable allies, Daniela.That&#39;s the only way to ensure your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling cornered and exasperated, Cedric pleaded,&#34;Why won&#39;t you trust me? I&#39;m capable of handling this. Let&#39;s work together on this, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced Cedric, whose stubbornness was noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t exactly known for her kindness. If she chose to, she could say something so cutting it would shatter Cedric&#39;s spirit. As she stood before him, she caught the unwavering determination reflected in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m your safest bet.&#34;</p>
