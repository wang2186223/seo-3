                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t remember ever feeling so cornered.Not even his father had managed to back him into a wall like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, with Carol refusing to let up, he finally understood what it meant to have no way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself frozen under her intense stare,feeling as though every secret he&#39;d tried to hide was suddenly exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not scared, alright?&#34; Any hint of defiance he&#39;d had was gone, replaced by an uneasy flicker in his eyes. He looked away and asked, &#34;What&#39;s there to be afraid of anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small laugh slipped from Carol. &#34;Is that so?Because I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration crept onto Nikolas&#39; face, and he moved forward,trying to bridge the gap between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol lowered her head, her eyes locked on him as he tried to close the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet before anything else could happen, Nikolas pressed his lips into a thin line and backed away,suddenly hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only made Carol&#39;s lips curl into a sly grin as she folded her arms, looking every bit like she was enjoying the standoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re walking out of here, whether you like it or not,&#34; Nikolas said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol arched a brow, her eyes gleaming with challenge. &#34;Really? You&#39;re going to force me? Tell me, Nikolas, would you risk everything just to keep me safe? Or do you honestly believe my life matters more to you than your own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Carol had pushed him right to his breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A straightforward answer was all she&#39;d hoped for. Instead, what came next wasn&#39;t even close to what she wanted to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine. Trust me, I know exactly what I&#39;m doing,&#34;Nikolas insisted, already beginning to pull back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol watched him for a moment, then whispered,&#34;Coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her voice, she turned to the group waiting upstairs. &#34;You three, that&#39;s enough waiting. Come down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light lauugh slipped from Daniela as she made her way down, Cedric and Damon following after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Daniela didn&#39;t say a word to Nikolas, the look she gave him said plenty. When it came to affairs of the heart, she always kept her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t stop Nikolas&#39; cheeks from turning pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sidling up beside Carol, Daniela leaned in and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t tease him too hard. He&#39;s sensitive.If he bolts, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34; Carol kept her mouth shut, her lips pressed into a line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never liked prolonging situations like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While there was plenty she wanted to clear up with Nikolas, now wasn&#39;t the moment for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Carol finally let the matter drop, Nikolas breathed out in obvious relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching that, Daniela just shook her head in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get to what really matters,&#34; Nikolas began,quickly launching into his plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he finished explaining, he shot a look at the clock. &#34;We&#39;re almost out of time. Bags are ready, so you all need to get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a crooked smile. &#34;You honestly think the guards sent by your uncle scare me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t believe how unfazed Daniela seemed. He&#39;d figured she&#39;d bolt the moment she heard the details. But that calm, steady look never left her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll take your dad&#39;s advice and leave with Damon,&#34; Daniela added, her voice cool and measured. &#34;The rest of us can manage what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered across Nikolas&#39; face. Daniela&#39;s confidence just made him more anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning toward Cedric, Nikolas nearly pleaded,&#34;This is crazy! Talk some sense into them, please!We&#39;ve only got thirty minutes before those guys get here. They don&#39;t mess around-l&#39;ve seen what they do.Breaking a man&#39;s neck isn&#39;t even hard for them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; gaze darted over to Carol, worry written all over his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her size, Nikolas figured she&#39;d be no match if those guards came crashing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, catching the desperation in Nikolas&#39; eyes,couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;Me? You know I have zero authority here. Whatever my wife says, goes. Still, I&#39;d suggest you leave now. If this turns ugly, it&#39;s not going to end well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made sure to soften the edge in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, Cedric wanted to tell Nikolas that he and Damon would only slow them down. But seeing Nikolas so on edge, he just couldn&#39;t say it outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scanned the group, confused by their unshaken calmness. &#34;Are you all seriously not worried about dying? Not even a little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His entire life, he&#39;d met all kinds of people who would do anything to save their own lives. Self-preservation was almost a given, at least until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet somehow, these three stood out. They were the only people he&#39;d ever seen who didn&#39;t flinch at the thought of dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. We&#39;ll handle things here. You and Damon should go. Come back the day after tomorrow,&#34;Daniela said as she waved off his concern with a reassuring nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she headed outside and started dialing for a car, glancing back to say, &#34;Carol,get Nikolas and Damon in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol wasted no time pushing Nikolas and Damon into the car, then snapped the door closed behind them. Nikolas didn&#39;t even manage a protest before the car&#39;s engine revved, and they tore down the driveway at rapid speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden acceleration nearly sent Nikolas sprawling across the seat. &#34;Wait, stop! I can&#39;t leave right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, a burly man with a wild beard, just grinned. &#34;Sorry, kid. Orders are orders. I&#39;m supposed to deliver you both safely to your father&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rose in Nikolas&#39; voice as he said, &#34;If we don&#39;t go back, we&#39;ll miss our chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, the driver pressed harder on the gas pedal.A few moments later, the man glanced in the rearview mirror and asked, &#34;So, which one of you is Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am,&#34; Nikolas snapped, barely containing his irritation. &#34;What&#39;s it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver shot him a quick look and nodded as if he&#39;d just checked off something on a list. &#34;Alright.Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he said nothing more, letting the silence stretch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home, Hamilton stormed around the courtyard,shouting into his phone, &#34;What do you mean you failed to pick them up? What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tirade was cut short when a car stopped outside the house, screeching to a halt.</p>
