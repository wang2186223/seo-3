                <p>Damon stood still, his eyes fixed on the ground,shoulders tense and low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton called out, &#34;Damon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon slowly lifted his head, his eyes locking with Hamilton&#39;s in a wordless exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face tightened. The look in his eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton spoke again, his voice dropped,every syllable thick with weight. &#34;Damon, I told you to come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Hamilton felt as though the world had spiraled into madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s this? You&#39;re just throwing your life away now? Is that the plan? You&#39;re going back to seek death too? You&#39;ve never been the type who handles pain well. You know what those assassins are capable of. They&#39;ll kill you if you go back. Just come home with me. I&#39;ll let the past go. I mean it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t raise his voice again. Instead, it softened with each word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had already turned his back on him. Hamilton wasn&#39;t sure he could handle losing another son the same way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause. Then Damon pressed his lips together, steadying himself. His voice came out firm.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t walk away from someone who means that much to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon turned and ran off without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood still for a long time, unmoving as rain pelted down from above and drummed on the ground around him. Damon&#39;s figure faded farther with each step, but his conviction never wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of all his children, Hamilton had always favored Damon-he was the bold one, the wild one, the kind who acted like nothing could ever touch him.Arrogance seemed stitched into his bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Damon, Hamilton saw echoes of his younger self.Maybe that was why he&#39;d always leaned toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, even his most beloved child was leaving him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing outside his villa, Hamilton stared out at the endless curtain of rain. His voice dropped to a whisper. &#34;Joseph, do you think l&#39;ve completely failed as a father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph kept his voice soft. &#34;They&#39;re still young, sir.Loyalty and friendship come first for them. But time changes everything. One day, they&#39;ll understand that loyalty isn&#39;t enough. You need power. You need wealth. That&#39;s what keeps a family safe. That&#39;s what keeps it standing. And the McCoy family has lasted because of you. You&#39;ve done more than most fathers ever could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton said nothing at first, just stood quietly letting those words sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he nodded, eyes distant. &#34;Maybe someday,they&#39;ll understand what I&#39;ve sacrificed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunder cracked overhead. Hamilton turned to Joseph. &#34;Send Scarface and his men. Bring back Nikolas, Damon, and Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone rose sharply. &#34;What are you standing there for? If we don&#39;t act now, they&#39;re as good as dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph lowered his voice. &#34;If we don&#39;t take Daniela back too, Cedric won&#39;t come with us. And if she stays behind, Carol won&#39;t return either. Without Carol, Nikolas won&#39;t move. And without Daniela, Damon won&#39;t budge. So if Daniela stays, we lose them all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clenched his jaw, his eyes narrowing. &#34;So she&#39;s the reason none of them will listen? You&#39;re telling me she&#39;s the one calling the shots now? Fine!Drag her back too, if that&#39;s what it takes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain slammed harder into the pavement, its rhythm digging into Hamilton&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled slowly, voice cold as steel. &#34;Bring her back. I must&#39;ve been cursed to raise such impossible children!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph hesitated. &#34;And... should I get Carol too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s temper snapped. &#34;What now? I&#39;ve already backed down once. Do you expect me to just keep surrendering? How many times do I have to give in before it&#39;s enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph dropped his gaze, quiet again. Hamilton shut his eyes and stood there, tense and bitter. He didn&#39;t speak for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton finally opened them, his tone was flat. &#34;This situation is a disaster. I&#39;l let it go-for now.But don&#39;t get confused, Joseph. I&#39;ll never accept Nikolas marrying some nobody. Never!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph nodded quickly. &#34;Of course, sir. Nikolas deserves someone worthy of his status. That woman is delùsional. I&#39;ll go now. We&#39;ll pull them all out-you&#39;ll get the chance to set things straight soon enough.&#34;</p>
