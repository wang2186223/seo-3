                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile, stepping closer to lend Elyse a hand to her feet. &#34;I need you to draw out Mr.Perry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse trembled at the weight of those words. &#34;l..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile widened, her voice soft but chilling. &#34;Or would you prefer to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse crumpled to the floor, her gaze fixed vacantly on Daniela, her heart heavy with a tide of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she had known then. If only she had killed Daniela too after getting rid of Brylee all those years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other option, Elyse nodded in resignation. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was dead, and Natalie had gone abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Alexander&#39;s backing, Joyce had taken the reins of Fairburne Group, her fortune soaring past the billion-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dollar mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a way, it was a masterstroke of a comeback, all thanks to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened as he turned his gaze to Joyce. &#34;Don&#39;t forget I want Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smiled sweetly at him, playfully pushing him back onto the bed. &#34;No rush. You want Daniela, and I&#39;ve got my/ eyes set on Cedric. Let&#39;s let the cards fall where they may.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Joyce made a beeline for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, she crossed paths with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes roamed over him, from head to toe. The real one truly outshone the fake one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That natural authority, that boldness, that self-assured swagger... It was something Alexander coud never hope to grasp, something he lacked deep in his core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an innate arrogance, woven into the very fabric of his being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Cedric was the man she had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, however, was oblivious to her presence, lost in admiration for a finely crafted jade bracelet he planned to gift to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the elevator, his focus remained glued to the bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tilted her head to steal a glance at him, letting out a chuckle. &#34;I never knew you could be such a devoted husband, Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before speaking,Joyce instinctively adjusted her outfit. When she finally spoke,her tone was laced with playful mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Cedric turned his head.Upon noticing Joyce, his brows knitted together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First Natalie, and now Joyce. When would he finally find peace to pursue his dream of having a child with Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression was anything but pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t care less. Wearing a cheerful smile, she sauntered over with an air of mischief. &#34;You seem rather displeased to see me. Did I do something to offend you in the past? Let&#39;s not forget-I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s stepsister. Technically speaking, doesn&#39;t that make us family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Joyce had wealth on her side, confidence clung to her like a second skin. She had a knack for teasing men, especially those who seemed unseasoned. Her playful remarks often left her targets fumbling,blushing,or both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lived for the awkwardness. It was a game she savored. So, with a glint of mischief in her eyes, she fixed her gaze on Cedric, waiting for his telltale reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t so much as flinch. With calm, he stepped aside. &#34;My wvife cut ties with the Harper family long ago.Let&#39;s not waste time dressing this up with all that &#39;family&#39; nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile faltered. &#34;Well, aren&#39;t you the protective one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slid open, Joyce took a deliberate step out, glancing back at Cedric with a lingering gaze that danced over his broad chest for just a moment too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips then curved into a smile of intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Nina emerged from the secretary&#39;s office and happened to catch the tail end of the scene. Nudging Lillian with her elbow, she whispered, &#34;Did you see that? Joyce was totally checking out Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes flicked to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight poured through the tall windows, gilding the room in a warm glow. Cedric stood tall and poised,his tailored suit hugging his frame with surgical precision, exuding both sophistication and restrained power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that golden light, a faint, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his lips, andhis shadow stretched long across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Cedric seemed to glow with a golden aura, effortlessly commanding admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian crossed her arms and clicked her tongue, then turned to see Nina&#39;s face filled with infatuation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric passed by, Lillian muttered under her breath, &#34;What a dangerously captivating charmer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paid her no mind and walked straight into Daniela; s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, his priority was to have a child with Daniela. Everything else was secondary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pushed the door open and entered, while Joyce&#39;s gaze naturally followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela noticed the way Joyce&#39;s eyes followed Cedric, and frowned ever so slightly, though the expression was fleeting, and Joyce didn&#39;t catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now seated across from Daniela, Joyce carried herself with the smug air of someone who had clawed their way to the top and wanted the world to know it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daniela, I&#39;m here to discuss a potential collaboration with you.&#34; Only she knew how satisfying it was to say those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the whispers had followed her: Katrina&#39;s daughter would never measure up to Brylee&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had endured years of hardship and suffering just to sit on equal footing with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as this moment finally arrived,it all felt worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Daniela less than a second to see through Joyce&#39;s newly-rich bravado. She smiled faintly.&#34;What kind of collaboration are we talking about?&#34;</p>
