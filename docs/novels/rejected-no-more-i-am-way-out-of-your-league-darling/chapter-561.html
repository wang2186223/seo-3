                <p>Hackett and the other association members had retreated to the seclusion of the mountains, finding solace in the natural hot springs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their choice of refuge was strategic, aimedat dodging any accusations of plotting against Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, reveling in the comforting warmth, narrowed his eyes contentedly. &#34;Ah, this is the life we deserve!&#34;he exclaimed, contentedly slapping his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin spread across Huey&#39;s face as he relaxed.&#34;Cedric won&#39;t get away so easily this time! I&#39;m eager to see him grovel and lose that smug arrogance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley laughed heartily, reminiscing about a recent encounter. &#34;Last time I bumped into Cedric at Elite Lux,I was so tempted to smack him. His arrogance is unbearable! He thinks he&#39;s some kind of business prodigy, but he&#39;s nothing compared to us who have weathered many storms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, nursing a glass of wine, brooded over his recent losses in their conflict with Daniela. His gaze was cold, his intentions dark. &#34;We should eliminate them both, if you ask me! And for Daniela, let&#39;s find a  group of men to rape her. No one will want her after we&#39;re done. That&#39;ll wipe the allure right off her face!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow was absorbed in his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett looked over at the preoccupied Winslow and chuckled.&#34;You won&#39;t find any reception here,Winslow.Relax, we&#39;re here to have a good time. Besides,Cedric has been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. No matter what Daniela tries, she won&#39;t be able to extricate him. Once we&#39;re back, we&#39;ll simply seize control of his business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around him roared with laughter, though Winslow kept his eyes glued to his phone. &#34;I can&#39;t shake this feeling of discomfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno burst out laughing. &#34;What&#39;s there to worry about, Winslow? Daniela hasn&#39;t even made a move against your business yet, so why the nerves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;re overthinking it, Winslow,&#34; Farley chimed in. &#34;This time, Cedric doesn&#39;t stand a chance against us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus looked at Winslow, hesitated, and then said,&#34;Winslow, why hasn&#39;t Daniela targeted you yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At ease, Winslow continued to stare at his device.&#34;Who knows? Maybe she&#39;s too busy. My firm is hardly on her radar; it&#39;s the smallest fish in the pond.&#34; A thought struck Hackett, an image flashing through his mind of a figure resembling Winslow when he went to see Daniela. &#34;You haven&#39;t gone behind our backs to strike a deal with Daniela,have you,Winslow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence suddenly enveloped the hot springs. All eyes in the group fixed on Winslow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting his phone aside, Winslow looked up slowly.&#34;What nonsense is this? Me,make a deal with Daniela?Come on, Hackett. You know as well as I do that l couldn&#39;t offer her anything substantial. What&#39;s mere pocket change to you is my entire operation. If she&#39;s willing to go after you, why would she let me off the hook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone paused to reflect after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno nodded slowly. &#34;That makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow shrugged off the comments lightly, saying,&#34;Perhaps Daniela just overlooked my company, or maybe she was too busy. You guys really expect me to join your financial misery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey chuckled and patted Winslow on the back.&#34;Come on, we&#39;re in this together. Remember, it was your plan to deal with Brylee. Daniela won&#39;t forget that.&#34; It was meant to ease the tension while also serving as a warning to Winslow. Winslow&#39;s gaze was cold as he stared off into the distance, a smirk playing on his lips. &#34;Afraid of Daniela?That day will never come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter erupted around him as the others nodded in hearty agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lingered in the comforting warmth of the hot springs for several hours, basking in relaxation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they emerged from the water, their phones,now within signal range, buzzed relentlessly with a flood of notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they gazed at their screens, the unfolding drama rivaled any prime-time soap opera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the stroke of midnight, headlines screamed with scandalous revelations like &#34;Shameless Commerce Association!&#34; and &#34;Apology Demanded from Commerce Association!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their own schemes against Cedric had spectacularly rebounded on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a state of panic, Hackett barely took the time to dry off before he was rushing to get dressed and out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, in his haste, slipped and tumbled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though they claimed there was no rush, their voices  quivered with a palpable sense of urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Racing down the mountain, they were glued to their phone screens, absorbing the latest updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno said, &#34;Who had the bright idea to retreat to these remote hot springs? We&#39;re cut off from everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley retorted, &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter now. We&#39;re already too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey said, &#34;Whoever&#39;s backing Cedric is a genius! How did they flip the script so completely, even with such damning evidence against him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc yelled from the back seat, &#34;Enough chatter! Just speed up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow peered out the window, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olisvine was going to change a lot.</p>
