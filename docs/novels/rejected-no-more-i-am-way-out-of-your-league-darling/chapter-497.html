                <p>Daniela paid no mind to Caiden&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her attention to the doctor beside her.&#34;How is he? Will he make it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, his refined demeanor betrayed by a sly smile, adjusted the IV drip. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.If you want him to live to a hundred, consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s body started to shake as terror gripped him.Trapped in this bleak, godforsaken madhouse, he knew death would be a mercy compared to the torment of staying here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! If you have any real guts, just kill me already!&#34; he bellowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill you? That would be too merciful. I doubt my mother would want to see you so soon.&#34; Daniela turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A furious voice rang out behind her. &#34;Daniela Harper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to see Caiden pushing himself up on the bed, his voice quiet, his eyes cast downward.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It was all my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lifted his gaze to meet hers. &#34;I loved you.l held you, cherished you. Are you really going to leave me here? Daniela, I&#39;m begging you. Don&#39;t be so cruel.I was wrong-l admit it! Take me home, please! It&#39;s freezing here at night. The wind screams through the windows. I can&#39;t sleep. Just take me home. Think of me as a harmless pet, something you keep around,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was sharp, her smile sharper. &#34;What are you thinking? A sinner like you doesn&#39;t deserve comfort. If you truly regret it, then repent properly in this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Caiden shouted as she turned to leave.&#34;know what you&#39;re looking for. Daniela, I know what you want to find out. Let me out, and I&#39;ll tell you everything!&#34; Daniela froze mid-step. She slowly turned her head,her piercing gaze locking onto Caiden. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re digging into your mother&#39;s death. You think someone else was behind it. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve kept Brylee and her daughter on edge. You know there are more people involved in your mother&#39;s death. You&#39;re searching for the real mastermind,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frost settled in Daniela&#39;s gaze. Her stare dropped to him as if he were nothing more than discarded filth. &#34;So, you knew all along. You knew someone else was behind my mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her piercing glare, Caiden&#39;s bravado wavered.But he also knew he wouldn&#39;t always get another chance. He couldn&#39;t keep faking suicide just to see her. This was his only shot-he had to take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, l&#39;ve always known. Katrina was just a maid.How could she have pulled the strings on her own?There had to be someone else behind her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes stayed cold. &#34;And how do you know Brylee and her daughter aren&#39;t acting alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden scoffed, &#34;I just know. But I won&#39;t tell you now.Get me out of here! Take care of me in my old age. If you agree, I&#39;ll tell you everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice sliced through the air, sharp and cold.&#34;You knew someone else was behind my mother&#39;s death all this time, yet you did nothing. You lived off her legacy, stood over her grave, and indulged yourself without a shred of guilt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden flinched under Daniela&#39;s piercing words.&#34;had no choice. Brylee made her own enemies. What did that have to do with me? You know what I&#39;m capable of. What could I have done? You were just a child. Did you expect me to fight those people and leave you orphaned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a cold laugh. &#34;Haven&#39;t I been an orphan all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden swallowed, his voice growing desperate.&#34;At least to the world, you were still a wealthy heiress.You know I&#39;m powerless. Who could I possibly take on? All I could do was protect myself. But listen-if you get me out of here, I&#39;ll tell you everything.I swear it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow, her tone mocking. &#34;And if |don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression darkened, his eyes glinting with ruthless resolve. &#34;Leave me here, and this secret dies with me. You&#39;ll never know who killed your mother,Daniela. You&#39;ll be trapped in this nightmare forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft, amused chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stiffened. &#34;Why are you laughing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly. &#34;Do I look scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated. &#34;Haven&#39;t you always been desperate to know who did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Of course, I wantto know. But I&#39;m patient. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s desperate, Caiden.After all, people only kill for love, power, or reputation. And now that I stand higher than my mother ever did, it&#39;s only a matter of time before they come for me, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Caiden stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied smile curled at Daniela&#39;s lips-she had hit the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked, silently cursing Caiden for being such a fool.</p>
