                <p>Nikolas&#39; fists tightened into hard knots, as he silently weathered over an hour of scathing insults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out of the room, a painful bump swelled on his forehead, the result of a brutal blow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon lingered in the doorway, his eyes cold as ice,unblinking and sharp. &#34;You nearly brought tragedy to McCoy Group, trying to kill five people! Have you completely lost your mind in your madness to become the heir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; expression remained frozen. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Don&#39;t you want to become the heir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I want it! But I&#39;d never reduce human lives to a mere joke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Well, that&#39;s where we differ. That&#39;s the difference between you and me, the future head of McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon locked eyes with Nikolas, his voice ice-cold.&#34;You&#39;re unworthy of being the heir of McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; anger flared in an instant. &#34;Oh? And who do you think is fit for it? You?&#34; Damon&#39;s voice rose in indignation. &#34;Daniela is the only one truly worthy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a scoffing laugh. &#34;What absurdity is this?Daniela? Is she even part of the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shot back without hesitation, &#34;Cedric is part of the McCoy family, and Daniela is his wife. That makes her one of us. Do you know who stepped forward and saved us in the midst of the crisis? It was Daniela!Without her level-headed and decisive actions,McCoy Group would have faced a catastrophic scandal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scoffed, dismissing the concern. &#34;McCoy Group is far too powerful to crumble over something so trivial. You&#39;re overthinking it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon quickly realized that further conversation with Nikolas was futile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, he shot a messagge to his brothers. &#34;I nearly died today! All thanks to NJikolas!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; hand shot out, seizing Damon by the collar &#34;Take it back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shot him a fiery glare. &#34;I&#39;m simply speaking the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, he shrugged off Nikolas&#39; grip and stormed off, not sparing a single glance behind him. Nikolas stood frozen, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all Daniela&#39;s fault!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of it, everything,was because of her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her, he wouldn&#39;t be clashing with his own flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted nothing more than to bring Daniela down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the winds had softened, their fury dwindling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy concern gnawed at Cedric&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Daniela sending him away terrifiedhim to his core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To stave off the anxiety, he threw himself into tasks,keeping his hands busy to avoid stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol cast a glance at Cedric, who was in the garden planting flowers alongside the gardener, then turned to Daniela, her voice laced with concern. &#34;Are you still thinking of sending him away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;You saw the danger today. If he remains here, these dangers will find him sooner or later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol hesitated, uncertainty clouding her voice. &#34;But l don&#39;t think Hamilton will allow Cedric to leave. His sons have shown themselves completely incapable.and it seems he has other intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grasped the truth of it During her visit to Hamilton, she had noticed his softened attitude toward Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood all too well what that shift in demeanor signified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The McCoy family is riddled with cunning and ruthless individuals. There&#39;s no reason for him to remain here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric entered from the garden, his ears catching Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face clouded with resolve. He locked eyes with Daniela and stated firmly, &#34;I&#39;m not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The events of the day had been too perilous. He couldn&#39;t leave Daniela to face it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can manage on my own,&#34; Daniela declared with unwavering certainty. &#34;When the wind calms this afternoon, you can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood frozen, taken aback. &#34;Why do you always push me away? This is the second time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the rising tension, Carol quietly slipped out of the room,leaving them alone. Cedric&#39;s gaze locked on Daniela, unwavering and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always do this. You act so strong, like you can carry everything on your own. But I worry about you!I wonder if you&#39;re struggling when I&#39;m not here.Daniela, do you really think so little of me? You&#39;d rather face danger with Carol than with me. Do you trust Carol more than you trust me? Daniela, we&#39;re a couple. Do you even know what that means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was on the edge, his temper about to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already reached his limit the first time Daniela had left without a word, leaving him hanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d tried to hold it in, but now, it was impossible to keep it buried any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience was never Cedric&#39;s strength. Yet for the woman he loved, he&#39;d instinctively buried all his sharp edges, holding back his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Cedric&#39;s gaze, her eyes searching his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice hardened with resolve. &#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that. This isn&#39;t negotiable. I&#39;m giving you two choices-I&#39;ll either stay here with you, or I&#39;ll go to Hamilton and tell him I&#39;m  returning to the McCoy family. The decision is yours.&#34; Daniela furrowed her brow. &#34;You have no interest in the McCoy family. Why would you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to, but you&#39;re leaving me no choice,&#34;Cedric snapped. &#34;As long as you&#39;re in Oiscoll, I&#39;m staying. If you send me away, I&#39;ll return and fight for the inheritance. Don&#39;t underestimate me. I can do anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a furious glare, Cedric stormed out, his anger blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the garden, the sharp snip of pruning shears cut through the air as he unleashed his anger on the plants, his frustration spilling over</p>
