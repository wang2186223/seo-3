                <p>Nikolas&#39; voice cut through the air,sharp with bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a knowing nod. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to Carol when I get back. Maybe she has some plans to make a match between you and the princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had no words to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft chuckle, just as his phone began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced over and saw Hamilton&#39;s name flashing on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he slid quietly to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric picked up the call. Hamilton&#39;s booming voice filled the car. &#34;Cedric! Have you lost your mind? Do you even know what you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s furious roar was so loud the driver recoiled in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you realize what the royal emblem means? It&#39;s the master key to royal power! With it,you claim Loglil&#39;s royal blessing and join the royal family.Do you know how much effort I&#39;ve put in to get the princess to notice you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gripped the phone, voice cool and detached.&#34;Effort? Isn&#39;t it just about getting that so-called princess to glance my way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared in disbelief at Cedric. He silently gave a thumbs-up,impressed despite himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s fury boiled over. &#34;You think it&#39;s that simple?Who gave you your bloodline? Me! Without my superior genes, would the princess even glance your way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really?&#34; Cedric sneered. &#34;I heard the princess met your five sons but wasn&#39;t impressed. Now she likes me.so clearly your so-called &#39;genes&#39; don&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned, mouth hanging open, staring at Cedric in sheer disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice stayed steady. &#34;So don&#39;t take all the credit for the good stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s rage flared again. &#34;Cedric! This was my hard -earned plan! Aren&#39;t you moved at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moved?&#34; Cedric shot back. &#34;In case you forgot, I&#39;m already married, and my marriage is solid. Does the princess know about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton replied, &#34;I&#39;ve already told her you&#39;ll get a  divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smirked. &#34;Oh really? Well, I have no intention of divorcing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone chilled. &#34;Cedric, do you realize what you&#39;re blindly throwing away? Think your life&#39;s fine as it is? It could be so much brighter. Daniela isn&#39;t worth you losing such a golden future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained calm. &#34;Is that so? But to me, Daniela is the only one who truly matters. If you treasure Loglil&#39;s power so much, why don&#39;t you go win the princess yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared in awe, momentarily speechless. He raised his thumb toward Cedric&#39;s face. &#34;Impressive! No one talks back to Father like that. He must be boiling!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lounged with quiet grace, voice cool. &#34;You never dared to talk back to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton acted like he ruled the world, believing he could bend everyone&#39;s will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, Cedric warned Nikolas, &#34;Keep this from the others,especially Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas typed on his phone, not glancing up. &#34;Why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how Daniela would react if she found out. What if she dumped him? He didn&#39;t want to be left behind again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too slow.&#34; Nikolas looked up, phone in hand. &#34;I&#39;ve already told her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned,eyes dropping to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; message read, &#34;Cedric has captured the Loglil princess&#39;s attention,and she wants him as her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon thrived on the drama and asked, &#34;Is this the princess who rejected all of us brothers for lacking charm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas responded,&#34;Yep, that very same princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol teased, &#34;Well, the princess has good taste.Guess she&#39;s not into misfits,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon threw up his hands in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shared the same helpless sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol laughed and tagged Daniela. &#34;Someone has taken a fancy to your husband. What&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
