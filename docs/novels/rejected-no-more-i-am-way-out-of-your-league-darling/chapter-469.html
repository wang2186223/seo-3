                <p>&#34;Well... Uh... I...&#34; Elyse stammered, her panic evident as she struggled to find her words. &#34;That recording-it&#39;s not my voice. Linden must have manipulated it.I never said those things!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of urgency, she continued, &#34;I stand by my words. That&#39;s not my voice, Daniela. You can&#39;t hold me responsible for your mother&#39;s death just because it&#39;s difficult for you to come to terms with.Honestly, I&#39;m being falsely accused here. Consider our relationship-we&#39;re family. What reason would I have to hurt your mother? She was practically a financial lifeline for me. Why would I harm someone who has given me so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela maintained a calm expression, her smile slight.&#34;Indeed,why would you,Aunt Elyse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes pleaded for understanding as she looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile softened as she continued, &#34;After my mother died, I was baffled as to why someone so full of life would leap from a building. And when my father quickly remarried,I couldn&#39;t grasp how he could move on so soon from his beloved wife. Years passed with just me,without the warmth of family, and my confusion only grew. But eventually, I accepted that  some things in life, especially human nature, are beyond understanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela concluded her thoughts, then stood up decisively. &#34;Elyse, you will face consequences for your actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze then turned to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light smile, she said, &#34;I recall how much my mother adored you when we were children. Did you ever imagine you&#39;d find yourself in such a predicament when you and your mother schemed against her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled lightly. &#34;Just be patient. This is merely the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela had disappeared from view that Elyse exchanged a look with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, disheveled and scantily clad in a towel,was a picture of despair and shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by emotions, Natalie burst into tears &#34;Mom! Everything&#39;s fallen apart. Daniela has shattered my life. All because of her vendetta tied to her dead mother, she&#39;s resorted to every underhanded tactic to ruin me. Now, I&#39;m a scandal in Olisvine. Daniela must be stopped.I need her gone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished her outburst, a knock sounded at the door. The hotel manager entered, dressed in a suit.holding a hefty bill. &#34;Madam, please settle your bill.The total comes to 8.8 million dollars.&#34; Upon hearing the enormous amount,Elyse collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile. Daniela exited the hotel and drove straight to her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone was silent, devoid of any new messages from Cedric for several hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sensed his displeasure was profound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped by a cupcake shop on her way.picking up a box of treats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they neared the villa, the building appeared mostly dark,save for a lone light in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan greeted her at the door with a worried look &#34;Daniela,he&#39;s extremely upset this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned sigh, Daniela entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped off her shoes, donned her slippers, and while walking to the living room, she flashed a cheerful smile. &#34;I grabbed your favorite cupcakes from the shop. Care for some?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, though typically easygoing, had an imposing presence when angered. His features were set in a stem expression, his eyes cold,fixating on something below,in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric...&#34; Daniela set the box of cupcakes on the table. &#34;I was just out managing a situation, nothing dangerous.I stayed within your boundaries.&#34; The dim lighting in the room cast dramatic shadows.slicing Cedric&#39;s face between light and darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you upset? I&#39;m sorry, Cedric. You have the final say here, alright?&#34; Daniela reached out to touch his hand,her fingertips lightly scratching to indicate her willingness to yield. &#34;I really am sorry. Please, let&#39;s not fight,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze slowly rose, his hand pulling away from Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in Daniela&#39;s stomach as she braced berself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say more, Cedric said,&#34;I saw the news coverage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was quite a spectacle. Elyse aimed for you and Linden, but instead, Natalie and Linden were caught.the police got involved, and it all ended in a public scandal for the Dury family. After the journalists left.you faced Elyse, didn&#39;t you? She must have been scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then turned his face away, shrouding it in shadow,his eyes gleaming with a stark,resentful cold.&#34;You emerged without a scratch. Quite remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip, sensing that her efforts to calm him were likely in vain. &#34;l...&#34; just can&#39;t take itanymore.&#34; Cedric murmured wearilyDaniela stared at him,her shock evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why am I always the last to find out? What have you done to make Elyse believe there&#39;s something between you and Linden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lifted his hand, signaling her to stop. &#34;There&#39;s no need to explain.&#34; He knew that she always had her reasons. &#34;It seems like you never really put me first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fists tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued without allowing her to interject.&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m not invincible. I feel fear, and I overthink things. Each time you leave, I&#39;m struck with worry about your safety. If anything were to happen to you.who would even tell me? It feels like I&#39;m always an afterthought to you. You know me so well, yet you don&#39;t seem to grasp what I truly need. What I desire is all of you, Daniela. I crave the fiery passion we share in our private moments and the fierce determination you display against your adversaries. Whether you&#39;re calm.composed, detached, elegant, courteous, or employing any tactic necessary. I want every part of you.&#34;</p>
