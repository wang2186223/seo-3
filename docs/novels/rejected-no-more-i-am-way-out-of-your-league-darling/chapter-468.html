                <p>Daniela walked through the crowd with Lilian at her side. &#34;What is going on? Natalie? You and Linden...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you two involved in an intimate relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly denied it. &#34;No! I&#39;m not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the chaos swvirling in her mind, she knew she couldn&#39;t confess. Admitting to a relationship with Kinden would bind her to him forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With such a disgusting man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was nowhere close to Cedric in any regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being tied to Linden was unbearable:she would rather face death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you&#39;re saying there&#39;s nothing between you? Yet here you are, caught in such a compromising situation in my hotel? Natalie, I had no idea you were so indiscreet. It&#39;s disappointing, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the situation escalated, Elyse stepped in to defend Natalie and said, &#34;It was all Linden&#39;s doing! He raped Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Daniela acted shocked as she grabbed the camera from a nearby journalist. &#34;This pose, this look of pleasure on her face... You say he raped Natalie.  yet it seems she enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was trapped; she could neither confirm nor deny the accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Linden, who had wrapped a scarf around himself for modesty,remained cool under the scrutiny of the cameras, a stark contrast to Natalie&#39;s visible panic. &#34;How could it be forced? Officer, everything was agreed upon. I often record such encounters,and the footage will show that Natalie was the initiator.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Natalie initiated it?&#34; one of the journalists blurted out,stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden confirmed with a nod,saying,&#34;Absolutely,why else would I be interested in a loose woman like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden continued, &#34;I have my own standards and preferences. Being with someone like Natalie,that&#39;s practically an act of charity on my part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His remarks were captured and repeatedly aired on the day&#39;s trending news broadcasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, Natalie&#39;s image plummeted from that of a revered woman to someone pitied even by Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police collected statements and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Journalists took photos and left with content smiles. Natalie remained on the bed,stunned,her mind utterly blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse,seething,confronted Daniela.&#34;You orchestrated this! You planned all of this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Daniela responded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden,now fully dressed, said to Daniela respectfully.&#34;Ms. Harper,I will take my leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled at Linden and asked, &#34;Did you get what you wanted? Are you pleased?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden shrugged and said, &#34;Not particularly. It was intriguing to pursue her when she was admirable. Now that she&#39;s been reduced to nothing, she&#39;s lost all appeal. If she begged me in the future, I wouldn&#39;t give her a second glance. Ms. Harper, I&#39;ll be just outside.Should you need anything, just call. As always,I remain at your service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words,Linden left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse wwas overwhelmed by the turn of events.&#34;Daniela,yor actions are merciless! You&#39;ve destroyed Natalie, and I swear you&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm and unthreatened. Seated elegantly on the sofa, silhouetted by the light, she played a recording from her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice filled the room. &#34;What&#39;s there to clarify?I was after their wealth, and they were too affluent for their own good. I ended Brylee&#39;s life, and Daniela  end will be by my hands as well-her fate will mirror her mother&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence suddenly enveloped the once chaotic room.</p>
