                <p>&#34;Hey, Joyce, life must be good to you lately, huh? Looks like you&#39;ve put on a few pounds.&#34; Ronald, seated across from Joyce, made the remark offhandedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to her daughter at his words. How much weight could Joyce have really gained?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina subtly lifted her hand and pinched her daughter&#39;s arm, feeling the unexpected softness. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she inquired in a subdued tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,looking somewhat bothered, responded, &#34;I don&#39;t know! l&#39;ve just been really hungry all the time.&#34; As she spoke, she reached for a side dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brow furrowed, about to comment, when the door to their private room burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard and Alexander entered, smiling as they presented a thoughtfully wrapped gift to Katrina. &#34;Sorry for the delay, Mr. and Mrs.Harper. Traffic was a nightmare,&#34; Richard apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina eyed Alexander, who seemed disengaged, more interested in his phone than the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina beamed, encouraging Alexander to sit next to Joyce and addressing Richard warmly, &#34;Oh, please,there&#39;s no need for formalities here. You can call my husband Caiden and me Katrina. Let&#39;s keep it relaxed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was skilled at smoothing over any awkwardness, her words weaving a sense of unity and ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her approach made it clear to all present; this gathering was more than a mere family dinner. It was a strategic move to cement an alliance between the two families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This contrasted sharply with Daniela and Alexander&#39;s hastily arranged wedding, which had lacked a formal introduction to family members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,with Alexander present, they nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was mature and composed-a perfect match for Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I&#39;m Joyce&#39;s second uncle, Wyatt. Over there is her third uncle, Ronald. We haven&#39;t had much interaction before, but from now on, let&#39;s keep in touch. We&#39;re family, after all.&#34; With a swift motion, Wyatt finished his drink in one gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he set down his empty glass, he noted that Alexander had only sipped his water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened momentarily, but he quickly masked it with a smile as he refilled his glass. &#34;So,Alexander, I hear your business is flourishing. You&#39;re in the renovation industry, correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt, who also owned a small renovation company, made a modest living with orders just in the hundreds of thousands annually. &#34;Should you have any upcoming projects, consider involving me.&#34; He clapped the young man sitting next to him on the shoulder. &#34;This is my son. He&#39;s green but eager.It would mean a great deal if he could shadow you and learn from the best. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt had done his homework before the dinner, aware of Alexander&#39;s significant status in the industry.Securing a position for his son under Alexander could potentially elevate their family&#39;s standing in the fiercely competitive local business environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed silent during Wyatt&#39;s proposal, prompting Katrina to intervene. &#34;Let&#39;s focus on the meal,everyone.Alexander, don&#39;t worry about drinking. Make yourself at home, relax and enjoy the food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Wyatt&#39;s attempts to steer the conversation back to business, Katrina smoothly redirected each time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,Wyatt slammed his glass onto the table, chuckling scornfully. He realized that while Daniela, not being Katrina&#39;s bioogical daughter, could be subjected to familial pressures without much concern from Katrina, Alexander was a different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander represented a direct benefit to Katrina, and she would not allow any encroachments on what she considered her personal asset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt rolled his eyes at this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina remained unfazed. In her view, only she was entitled to reap benefits from her daughter or her prospective son-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meal progressed, a plate of steamed fish was served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fish, cooked to perfection without a drop of wwater, was tender and flavorful, a dish Joyce always relished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina slid the dish towards Joyce with a warm smnile, then turned to engage Richard. &#34;Richard, when we first met, we were both in our early thirties. Now here we are, our children grown, time slipping by. It&#39;s remarkable how fast the years go, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard recognized Katrina&#39;s tactic immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone at the table understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was subtly setting the stage to steer the conversation towards Joyce and Alexander&#39;s impending union.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard offered a polite smile in return. &#34;Yes, indeed, time does fly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, en route to the dinner, Richard had discussed the situation with Alexander. He viewed Daniela as a coveted match currently beyond reach. For the moment, maintaining stability with Joyce was prudent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By neither accepting nor dismissing the proposal outright, he could delay decisions until Daniela&#39;s intentions became clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoud she show signs of a change of heart, a reunion might still be feasible. If not, Joyce would serve as an adequate alternative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling it was the right moment, Katrina began to extol Joyce&#39;s virtues enthusiastically. &#34;Joyce is a wonderful girl. She&#39;s charming and unlike some young women who flounder at the sight of a suitor. No,Joyce has always shown exemplary discipline. She embodies the grace of a genuine lady, groomed to be the ideal spouse for a distinguished family. The man who marries her will indeed be fortunate. And you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh!&#34; Joyce interrupted with a sudden gag, cutting Katrina off mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina fixed her with a stern look. Now? At this critical moment while she was lavishing praise?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sat there, her face ashen, overwhelmed by the strong scent of the fish that she normally loved. Now,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it was repulsive, the smell invading her senses, triggering waves of nausea that coursed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the plate away and muttered, &#34;Please, go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s irritation was palpable as her eyes narrowed, but she quickly masked it with a forced smile,turning back to Richard. &#34;Now, where was I? Oh yes, Joyce&#39;s character is impeccable. She&#39;s truly a wonderful-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh!&#34; Joyce gagged again, cutting Katrina off a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression turned stormy with frustration. &#34;Remove that fish!&#34; she commanded the waiter sharply,her annoyance spilling over onto the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she faced Richard again, her expression had reset to one of calm and control, as if the previous outbursts had never occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard couldn&#39;t help but be struck by her ability to maintain poise. Despite the awkward interruptions, she appeared utterly unruffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, he cringed, feeling a secondhand embarrassment for her situation.</p>
