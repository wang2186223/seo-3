                <p>Cedric was well aware of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his neck back just a little. &#34;I&#39;ll speak to them about it later,&#34; he said, his mind working on a way to shorten the ten-year term, maybe with a bet. &#34;Please don&#39;t be mad,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Joyce and Caiden shifted their gaze toward Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face showed no emotion, leaving it unclear whether she was angry or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wanted to elaborate, but the presence of Joyce and Caiden, coupled with the need to rush to the airport to pick up Nikolas, left no room for further discussion. &#34;I&#39;ll fill you in tonight after I return. I must head to work now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching the entrance, Cedric heard Caiden click his tongue and tell Daniela, &#34;Cedric&#39;s lost all of his money in gambling, hasn&#39;t he? Daniela, I&#39;m saying this for your own good-Cedric&#39;s broke now. You&#39;ve lost your memories, right? It&#39;s best you leave him while you have the chance.&#34; Joyce smiled, picturing Cedric&#39;s striking features.&#34;Daniela, just break it off with him. I&#39;ll gladly take him in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was as good-looking as a star. If Daniela didn&#39;t want him anymore, Joyce was more than happy to take her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Cedric&#39;s expression darkened as he turned and departed for his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Cedric had left, Caiden whispered to Daniela, &#34;If you do end up divorcing him, don&#39;t let him off easy.Isn&#39;t he the son of Hamilton McCoy? Hamilton doesn&#39;t even know Cedric is his son. Reaching out to Hamilton could lead to a substantial payoff. And if Hamilton takes Cedric in, you won&#39;t even need to divorce him.He&#39;s the heir to the world&#39;s wealthiest man-you&#39;d hit the jackpot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished speaking, Daniela gave him a cold, piercing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Caiden asked, &#34;What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was indifferent as she said, &#34;I&#39;ve told you before-this stays secret. Never mention it again.If I hear you bring it up, I will make you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden recoiled, muttering, &#34;Cedric isn&#39;t even here.Why so secretive?&#34; Daniela fixed a cold stare on Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lips tightening, Caiden said, &#34;Alright, alright, I&#39;ll pretend I never knew. But you&#39;re missing a golden opportunity here. Did you catch what Cedric said earlier? He&#39;s off to pick up Nikolas from the airport.Cedric might not fight for Hamilton&#39;s fortune,but Hamilton&#39;s sons might not see it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bowed her head, focusing on her phone.&#34;Just stay out of it. I&#39;ll handle it and arrange for you to meet Nikolas. Then you&#39;ll see if he was the one who helped you escape from that asylum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden muttered resentfully,&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Landing, Nikolas repeatedly tried to contact the head of the mercenaries, but to no avail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow furrowed, yet he was somewhat confident they had dealt with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Cedric was merely a businessman-what chance could he have against professional assassins?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Nikolas, killing Cedric seemed like an easy task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WVith a self-satisfied smile, Nikolas made his way to the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he saw a face strikingly similar to his own.His steps halted abruptly, and his eyes narrowed. Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant hurried over. &#34;Mr. McCoy, why is Cedric here? I thought you had him dealt with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas furrowed his brows in frustration. &#34;Get in touch with those incompetent fools! Is this how they manage things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While issuing commands, Nikolas caught Cedric&#39;s eyes shifting in his direction. A slight frown formed on Cedric&#39;s face as he looked at Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Cedric march towards him, Nikolas noted the man&#39;s uneven pace; Cedric was limping, as if he had suffered a serious injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a neutral face, Nikolas met him halfway. Cedric offered a handshake warmly. &#34;Mr. McCoy, a pleasure to meet you. I&#39;m Cedric Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s goal was to seal the business deal first, then negotiate with Clarinda to shorten his ten-year term to just five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile was warm, but Nikolas eyed it skeptically and left Cedric hanging,hand outstretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had navigated the business world on his own,battling every step of the way. A bit of cold treatment was insignificant to him. &#34;Mr. McCoy, you must be weary. I&#39;ve arranged accommodations at a local hotel where you can relax first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a nonchalant grunt in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the way,Cedric moved forward with Nikolas trailing. Observing Cedric&#39;s limp, Nikolas said, &#34;You&#39;re quite the committed man, Mr. Phillips, meeting with clients despite your leg injury. If I didn&#39;t have all the facts, I&#39;d believe Phillips Group was facing financial trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary noticed the sarcasm in his tone and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric just laughed it off. &#34;There&#39;s always room for growth, isn&#39;t there? Despite your empire, Mr. McCoy,here you are in Olisvine, seeking more opportunities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This comment shadowed Nikolas&#39; face with annoyance.However, he quickly masked it. &#34;Mr. Phillips,your injury-how did it happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Cedric offered a slight, assured smile,displaying neither discomfort nor embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of the circumstances, his demeanor exuded unshakeable confidence, even on a weakened leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was from an explosion a few years back,&#34; he said  casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas watched Cedric&#39;s indifference with frustration.It seemed as though Cedric had already come to terms with his leg&#39;s condition, and that irritated him.</p>
