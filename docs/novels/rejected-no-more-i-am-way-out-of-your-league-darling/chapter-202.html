                <p>The following morning, as Caiden stepped out of his room, he caught sight of Daniela leaving hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Cedric appeared, his head lowered and his entire demeanor radiating frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden paused for a brief moment before walking over to Cedric. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Did you get chewed out last night? Why the sour face so early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot him a sharp, icy glare, his whole being emanating cold hostility. &#34;Get lost,&#34; he retorted coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The issue with Cedric&#39;s money stilI not reaching Caiden&#39;s account remained unresolved. With no other options, Caiden reluctantly turned to Alexander for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden explained the situation, Alexander&#39;s face twisted in disbelief. &#34;Three hundred million?&#34; Then, as realization set in, a smirk tugged at his lips.&#34;Ah,so you&#39;re playing both sides? You asked me for fifty million, while trying to squeeze Cedric for three hundred million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden scratched his nose, his embarrassment evident on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t seem overly bothered by the fifty million. He&#39;d long been aware of Caiden&#39;s despicable nature. What confused him, though, was why Cedric would so willingly hand over three hundred million to Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it to keep the truth buried?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logically, Cedric should have been the one desperate for Daniela to know who had been there for her as a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why would Cedric be willing to pay to keep that secret?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t wrap his head around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to press Caiden for more answers, but Caiden wasn&#39;t interested in discussing it further. All that mattered to him was when the money would finally show up in his account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Alexander agreed to assist Caiden but laid down one condition: Caiden had to return the fifty million he had given him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s frustration bubbled over. &#34;Is it any wonder Daniela left you? You can&#39;t even compare to Cedric when it comes to generosity. Last night, he ended up moving more than three billion! And here you are,bartering over fifty million like it&#39;s a fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden assumed Alexander&#39;s request was rooted in concerns about security or some other bureaucratic nonsense, but to him, it just seemed petty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine! I&#39;ll return it. With three hundred million coming my way, your fifty million won&#39;t even be noticeable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden handed the money back to Alexander and reached out to Cedric&#39;s secretary to settle the issue. Cedric had received notifications that the failed transfers had been refunded. Annoyed, he handed the matter over to his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the secretary double-checked Caiden&#39;s account details and initiated the transfer once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, just like before, the money left Cedric&#39;s account,but it never made its way into Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Caiden could hardly believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his desperation, he turned to Alexander, pleading for the return of the fifty million, only to be met with a firm refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his breaking point, Caiden stood in the courtyard,hands on his hips, and said to Cedric&#39;s secretary,&#34;Withdraw it in cash! Tell Cedric to come to the bank with me when he&#39;s free!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the secretary passed this message to Cedric,he soon received a text from Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to the secretary. &#34;Forget the transfer.Head back to the Harper family.&#34; By the time Cedric reached the Harper family villa,Lillian was already standing at the door,suitcase in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asked. &#34;Didn&#39;t she agree to let me stay here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly looked away, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pointed to the villa, and Cedric breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Caiden was trying to smooth things over.&#34;Daniela, this is going too far. Cedric&#39;s been nothing but kind to you. He&#39;s wealthy, but he&#39;s willing to stay in this shabby house with you. How could you push himn away like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden opened his mouth to say more, but Daniela turned her head slowly, her cold gaze sweeping over him like a sharp wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer intensity of her gaze silenced him instantly. He shrank back, wisely choosing not to  speak another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped into the living room, then knelt down on the floor, facing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up. Her head tilted slightly as she sat on the plush rug, absently scrollingthrough her tablet, lost in the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Just give me a reason,&#34; he asked.</p>
