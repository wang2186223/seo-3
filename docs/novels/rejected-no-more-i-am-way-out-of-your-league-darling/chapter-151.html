                <p>Daniela&#39;s phone vibrated, announcing a video message from Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the footage, Katrina lingered near the bathroom entrance,gripping her smartphone.She whispered into the device, &#34;Mom, I&#39;m doing everything I can to handle this mess, but if Caiden&#39;s decided to sell the company, there&#39;s nothing more I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply from the other end was muffled and indecipherable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression contorted with vexation as she retorted, &#34;Doesn&#39;t that just prove Brylee had it coming?Damn it, I should&#39;ve listened to you and finished her too back then. Now she&#39;s become an immense threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Katrina stiffened, her eyes flickering anxiously towards the security camera overhead. Then,she terminated the call smoothed down her dress,and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated in her office, Daniela clutched a pen so fiercely her knuckles blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s mother had been dead for years, hadn&#39;t she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could Katrina possibly mean by those ominous words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Caiden returned to the hospital bearing the new medication. Remarkably, the child became the first in the nation to show clinical improvement with this treatment, sidestepping the need for surgical intervention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical team buzzed with excitement, eager to document this breakthrough and glean insights that might benefit others facing similar predicaments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden dismissively rejected the pleas from parents with sick children. His face twisted into a sharp,disdainful sneer as he snapped, &#34;This is the health we paid for! Fund it yourselves! Why should you benefit from our child&#39;s plight? Dream on! Our child is a treasure, not a public spectacle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the hospital room,desperate patients begged for assistance, but Caiden strode past them, utterly indifferent to their suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, his own interests always took precedence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in the hospital, Alexander was recovering from a skin graft surgery when he overheard a news broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, his eyes wide with astonishment, gestured  towards the television. &#34;300 million for a single pill?That&#39;s astounding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smirk crossed Alexander&#39;s lips, pulling painfully at his fresh stitches, making him grimace.&#34;Daniela&#39;s making quite the spectacle. She&#39;s using this to embarrass Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. &#34;But why didn&#39;t she just seize control of the entire company? It was her mother who established it, after all. What stopped her from going after the entire company? Is there still a part of her that cares about Caiden, even after everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s scoff was tinged with scorn,his expression growing sterner. &#34;That kind of emotion doesn&#39;t exist in Daniela&#39;s world. Look at my scars-do you really think a person capable of this harbors any kindness? Her beauty is merely a facade, a tool for devastation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard cast a glance at Alexander. It sounded like Alexander had moved on from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when the surgeon posed a question about whether Alexander desired his post-operative appearance to mirror his former self or to be altered,Alexander wanted it to be as it was before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard believed Alexander still had lingering affections for Daniela. As Alexander and Richard ambled near the maternity ward, Caiden&#39;s loud curses came from within. The whole corridor echoed with his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard and Alexander slowed their steps, drawn by the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! What a fucking nightmare she is! If I&#39;d known the hell Brylee was bringing, I&#39;d have stopped it before it started!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out a soft sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden continued, &#34;For fuck&#39;s sake, now that she&#39;s holding 51%, she thinks she&#39;s untouchable, turning Harper Group into a playground for her lackeys.What&#39;s her endgame? To push her own father out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the glass door, Alexander observed as the veins on Caiden&#39;s neck stood out starkly,his fury palpable and filling every corner of the room.</p>
