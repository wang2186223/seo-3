                <p>Without sparing even a backward glance, Nikolas turned and walked off after saying his final words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a weary sigh, the secretary quickly followed behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got it wrong, sir. Your father may be harsh,but everything he&#39;s done is for your sake and the family&#39;s future. His ways might feel cruel, but his heart has always aimed for what he believes is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping in his tracks, Nikolas lifted his gaze toward the upper floor with a hardened expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs in the study, Hamilton&#39;s voice rang out like a strike of iron. &#34;If he&#39;s so eager to walk away, then let him! He&#39;s been living as the McCoy heir for too long.He&#39;s clearly forgotten where his success actually came from. Go ahead and let him leave! Let the world see how far he gets without the McCoy family behind him! Joseph, get in touch with the PR and the legal departments. If Nikolas wants to cut ties,then we will make it official. Release a public statement declaring that from this moment forward, he has no connection to the McCoy family whatsoever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any remaining sliver of attachment Nikolas felt toward the McCoy family shattered completely beneath Hamilton&#39;s merciless declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm nod, he answered with conviction,&#34;Fine!I&#39;m walking away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not pausing for a second, he walked off again. His brothers trailed behind for a few steps, but Nikolas stopped them. &#34;Don&#39;t follow me. This isn&#39;t sudden.I&#39;ve wanted to break free for a long time. I only want the life I&#39;ve never been allowed to live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with those final words, Nikolas left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice rang out again, louder than before.&#34;If he&#39;s walking out, then make sure it&#39;s clean.Joseph, alert the finance department. Cancel every</p>
                
                
                
                <p>card in Nikolas&#39; name and freeze all his accounts. Tell every partner we deal with that Nikolas is no longer one of us. No privileges, no favors, no exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned silence fell over the McCoy brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had every intention of wiping Nikolas&#39; name from influence entirely, turning him into an outcast across the nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no longer any tie between Nikolas and the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now stripped of the McCoy family&#39;s support, Nikolas looked more like an abandoned stray, wandering with no home and no identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Nikolas took with him was a few thousand in cash and the clothes he wore, which now served as his only true possession of worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that same evening, Hamilton laid down a strict order to every member of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone dared to assist Nikolas in secret, even by the smallest money, they would be cast out of the family without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, in one cruel night, Nikolas was completely forsaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He managed to rent a hotel room for two nights, but before long, his money dwindled down to a few scattered coins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they exited their car, Daniela and Cedric noticed a figure hunched near the villa in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly on guard, Cedric stepped in front of Daniela, blocking her wth protective instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Daniela studied the silhouette more closely and murmured, &#34;That looks like Nikolas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After squinting for a moment, Cedric nodded. There was no doubt-it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hand clasped around Daniela&#39;s, Cedric guided her forward and asked, &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lifted his head. The first thing he saw was  Daniela&#39;s and Cedric&#39;s intertwined hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow passed over his face, and his expression turned grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within Oiscoll, Daniela stood as one of the rare few that could challenge Hamilton&#39;s authority and still succeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anywhere else to turn,&#34; Nikolas answered,his voice heavy with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, clearly taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric showed just as much surprise, momentarily silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a McCoy, and yet you&#39;re saying you have no place in Oiscoll? A city practically ruled by your own family?&#34; Cedric asked, struggling to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a quick look at Daniela, who now stood quietly behind Cedric with a blank face, Nikolas answered, &#34;I&#39;m no longer a McCoy. They&#39;ve already released an official notice, taking away every title l held in the group. Have you not seen the news?&#34; Even in his decline, he still held on to the pride of someone who had been the heir for far too many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet neither Daniela nor Cedric were the type to offer sympathy easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kindness had never been their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ignored Nikolas and turned to Daniela. &#34;Come on inside. I&#39;ll cook that dish you love. The fish we picked up today looks perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Nikolas another look,Cedric walked forward,leading Daniela forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas remained rooted to the spot, his eyes fixed on Cedric and Daniela as they entered the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door opened gently, spilling golden light across the ground, then shut quietly behind them,leaving Nikolas alone in the quiet, growing dark.</p>
