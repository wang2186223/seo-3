                <p>Cedric immediately figured out what Hamilton had in。mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton always knew how to test limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was ready to tell him to drop it, but right as he opened his mouth, he remembered how Hamilton had shielded Daniela from danger at the door. So he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept muttering, &#34;This is too risky. How are you and Daniela supposed to handle this alone if we leave? How are you going to manage? Josh has completely lost it. If something happens to either of you,no one will even know. And honestly, what&#39;s the point of living in a mansion like this? We don&#39;t even have neighbors!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got to his feet, stubborn as ever. &#34;I&#39;m staying!Cedric, I&#39;m not talking to you. I&#39;m talking to Daniela.This isn&#39;t your conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers stepped out of their rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw Hamilton making his way upstairs and turned to Cedric. &#34;&#39;If he stays, then we&#39;re not leaving either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t expected it to be this hard to make them leave. Even Cedric couldn&#39;t manage it. Truthfully, -she wasn&#39;t much better at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Cedric had grown up practically without parents, facing danger and cruelty most of their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had met a few kind souls along the way, but real family had always been scarce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela still wasn&#39;t sure how to deal with these types of relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a soft approach, saying, &#34;Please go home,Hamilton. I just want you to be safe. If something happens to you, my babies will have one less person who loves them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at her, his eyes wide. &#34;I&#39;mn afraid-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to say he was scared she wouldn&#39;t survive to give birth. But once he realized how heavy those words sounded, he stopped himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a gentle smile. &#34;Part of the reason l came to Oiscoll was to find the person who killed my mother. But that&#39;s not the only reason. Want to know the other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked at her,his expression saying loud and clear that nothing she said would change his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,she continued, &#34;I wanted to meet Cedric&#39;s father.I wanted to knowN what kind of man he was. Honestly,I was disappointed at first. I thought-oh, so Cedric&#39;s father was just another man chasing money.&#34;Hamilton&#39;s face darkened. &#34;And now?&#34; he asked,urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled again. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you when we meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she finished, she gave Carol a quick signal. Carol nodded and sent a bodyguard to escort Hamilton out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he was being led away, he called back, &#34;But what about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, a few people poked their heads out and stared upward. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; one of them asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply said, &#34;Everyone, hurry and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas grabbed his luggage from his room. On his way out, he told Cedric, &#34;Call us if anything happens.We&#39;ll come right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon pointed toward the stairs and chuckled.&#34;Looks like Daniela has the final say in this family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being taken home, Hamilton tried to return that very same day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he prepared to leave, the weather forecast suddenly announced a rare hailstorm, trapping him at his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet soon settled over Daniela&#39;s house. She watched TV without a care, Cedric busied himself in the kitchen, and Carol sprawled on the sofa playing games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the rain fell hard, pounding against the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Daniela&#39;s eyes shifted toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,noticing her, looked up and met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes passed before Daniela finally said,&#34;They&#39;ve gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol let out a breath. &#34;Great.&#34; Then she turned her attention back to her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a message flashed across Carol&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Nikolas. &#34;Any updates?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol swiped it away, choosing to keep playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, another message came. &#34;Are you playing games? Should I come join you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet another text popped up. &#34;What server are you on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp tap, Carol blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Daniela&#39;s phone began to ring.</p>
