                <p>Natalie was caught off guard when Daniela spun the laptop back toward herself and said, &#34;Fine. Carol, call the police and have her taken back to prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was stunned. She burst out, her voice rising. &#34;Daniela! You can&#39;t do this to me. Did you forget that we&#39;re cousins? Just let me go, and I&#39;ll tell you who helped me escape prison back then.Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol grabbed her and pulled her out of the room without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been watching from the side, stepped forward. &#34;You&#39;ve done all this just to trace the one behind Natalie. Are you sure it&#39;s wise to send her away now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;She has no clue who helped her. We&#39;ve tracked her for weeks-she&#39;s been searching for explosives all on her own. That tells me she&#39;s no different from Caiden and Joyce. They&#39;re just pawns sent to take me out. She&#39;s not in on the bigger plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned in. &#34;Does the mastermind have accomplices?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Yes. Winslow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked, surprised. &#34;What makes you so certain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged slightly. &#34;Call it a gut feeling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that had happened pointed toward someone linking up with the one called M. With every other member of the commerce association gone, Winslow was the last man standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow, unlike the rest, had been saved-but after that, he kept completely quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That in itself raised a red flag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why she concluded Winslow had to be the one holding the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M, who engineered her mother&#39;s death years ago, now manipulated Natalie into killing her with a bomb. What was the endgame behind it all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he go to such extremes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed as Cedric walked out, phone already in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed Mose. &#34;I need you to track someone down for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are we talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered, &#34;Winslow Flores.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Winslow? Word is Clarinda is hunting him too. Boss,you&#39;re after him as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused. &#34;Clarinda&#39;s after Winslow too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but it is said that Winslow has been spotted recently in Zentara. Boss, are you planning to compete with Clarinda for him? That could get complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;I don&#39;t care how tough it gets. Just bring him to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got it, Boss! I may not be as strong as the Cealmaur members, sure-but if it&#39;s about tracking and grabbing someone, you can count on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lone Wolf&#39;s specialty had always been tracking people down and controlling them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, tracking down Winslow was no challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Cedric headed back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was reviewing surveillance footage on her laptop when her phone suddenly buzzed with a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was from Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you free tonight? I&#39;d like to have dinner-just the two of us. There are some things about Cedric I need to talk to you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela read the message but didn&#39;t respond right away. She was about to set her phone aside when it buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, this is about my father coming to Olisvine. I know you and Cedric aren&#39;t interested in the inheritance, but he&#39;s incredibly stubborn. Just thought I&#39;d give you a heads-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric, who was occupied in the kitchen. Then she typed a short reply.、&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile tugged at Nikolas&#39; lips as he read Daniela&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Richard. &#34;She&#39;s showing up tonight. Make sure you finish her off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glint lit upin Richard&#39;s eyes. &#34;Count on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Nikolas was stunned to see Carol and Cedric following Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I thought we agreed to talk alone,&#34; Nikolas said, clearly irritated. She was always full of surprises.He could never keep her under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did we?&#34; Daniela lifted her chin a touch, her eyes locking onto Richard seated opposite her. &#34;Is this your idea of a private talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a strained smile. &#34;We bumped into each other, that&#39;s all. McCoy Group&#39;s been working with Bennett Group lately. He wasn&#39;t specially invited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Richard a quick look. He carried himself with the air of someone used to being in control. Not for a moment did she believe it was just a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, take a seat,&#34; Nikolas said as he shot Richard a look filled with silent instruction-once Carol was out,it would be time to eliminate Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gave a firm nod, fully on board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied gleam spread across Nikolas&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone was seated, Nikolas leaned toward Carol and said,&#34;Carol, I&#39;m sorry, but this is a private matter concerning the McCoy family. It might be best if you step outside for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked over at Daniela. Daniela&#39;s eyes moved to Richard, who clearly wasn&#39;t planning to leave. She looked at Nikolas. &#34;If this is about the McCoy family, shouldn&#39;t Richardstep out too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The point was clear-if someone had to go, Richard should be the first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hesitated. &#34;Well, he&#39;s already familiar with the situation. We&#39;ve talked about family issues before-he&#39;s good at managing things like this. But Carol, maybe you could excuse yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept his eyes fixed on Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t budge. She stayed quiet, firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was steady. &#34;Say what you came to say, or we&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
