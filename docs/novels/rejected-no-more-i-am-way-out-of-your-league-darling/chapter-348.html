                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t move right away, and Joyce wasn&#39;t in a hurry either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out lazily, starting a game on her phone-it was one made by Daniela&#39;s gaming company. The sound of gunfire from the game echoed through the room, and Alexander couldn&#39;t help but think Joyce was a little nuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the round wrapped up, Alexander finally walked to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t look surprised at all. She gestured for him to sit on the sofa, then casually draped her legs across his lap. &#34;Give them a good rub.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Aren&#39;t you worried Doug will find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce burst out laughing. She laughed so hard she had to hold her stomach, unable to stop.&#34;Worried? Not at all. And you&#39;re not either, are you, Alexander? Otherwise, what are you doing here? Seriously, stop acting all high and mighty with me. At the end of the day, we&#39;re both cut from the same cloth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce caught the disapproval in Alexander&#39;s furrowed brow when she mentioned&#34;we&#39;re both cut from the same cloth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at her lips as her confidence grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved the feeling of getting under his skin, especially when it came to someone like Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, do you even understand why Daniela chose Cedric in the end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Joyce felt a little more pressure on her legs. It wasn&#39;t painful, just a subtle discomfort, but she didn&#39;t mind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something twisted about the way she enjoyed seeing Alexander&#39;s strained expression. &#34;You&#39;re so full of yourself. You always think the world revolves around you. When Daniela came back, you were convinced she still loved you. But Cedric? He was different. He made her his world. He put everything into her, and no woman can resist that kind of devotion. While you were still stuck in your ways, Cedric had already claimed her heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alexander&#39;s hands stopped moving, and his eyes grew cold, locking onto her. A flash of something dark passed through his gaze-murderous,even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce saw it, and it only made her laugh harder. &#34;You know, when I was messing around with men and had a kid, your father once said Daniela wouldn&#39;t have done anything like that. He said I was no match for her. If Cedric were in your shoes today, he wouldn&#39;t be crawling back to me, begging for money like you. He wouldn&#39;t lower himself. So you&#39;re not better than Cedric either. You were never worthy of Daniela.You and I?We&#39;re the same. So stop chasing things that are beyond your reach. Do you really think you deserve it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s words cut deep, offering no space for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughedagain, but this time, it was more maniacal. &#34;Do you honestly think rebuilding your company will change anything? That Daniela will look at you differently? What do you think-you&#39;re going to make it that big? How laughable! Every time your business hit a crisis, who was there to bail you out? Daniela,remember? Your so-called &#39;business talent&#39; doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to hers. You&#39;re just like everyone else-ordinary. And that&#39;s why, when Daniela left, you couldn&#39;t even handle a small setback. And here you are again, begging me for money. Let me guess, are you going to say it again tonight? That you&#39;ll &#39;serve me just this once&#39;? Go ahead, say what you want, but in the end, you&#39;ll always crawl back to me, using my money to feed your fragile pride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit like a series of heavy blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sprang from the sofa, his chest rising and falling with barely controlled anger. &#34;Joyce, that&#39;s enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t move, staying stretched out on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice turned icy. &#34;Just because you toss me a few scraps doesn&#39;t give you thé right to humiliate me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the last straw. Alexander stormed out of the house, his anger palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed behind him, the force of it echoing with a sharp bang. Joyce didn&#39;t care at all, a smirk curling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve gone too far? What if he doesn&#39;t come back?&#34; Erika stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t even glance up, her focus still on the game. &#34;If I don&#39;t crush his pride, how else am I supposed to keep him as my little pet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika hesitated. &#34;But what if he really doesn&#39;t come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shrugged, still not looking up. &#34;Then he doesn&#39;t come back. What do I need with a disobedient man?I already have to put up with Doug. Why would I bring another man into my life to step on me? With money, I can have any man I want. Alexander&#39;s not worth this kind of stubbornness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric&#39;s determined face flashed in Joyce&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had been Cedric, she might have given it some thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, you&#39;ve got more going for you than your mother. Well, your mother seems to be plotting to take you away,&#34; Erika said, concern creasing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce kept playing her game. &#34;Relax, I&#39;m not going anywhere. I&#39;ll make sure you get the money every month,and I&#39;ll even send more-just give it to my mom and tell her to drop those crazy ideas. I&#39;m perfectly fine here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika&#39;s weathered face lit up with a smile.&#34;Yes, moments like these don&#39;t come often. How could you leave?You can&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
