                <p>&#34;How is this possible? That room gets the best sunlight in the whole house. It&#39;s the biggest and the most comfortable! Joyce has always stayed there,&#34; Katrina protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s high time we fix that mistake,&#34; Daniela said without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Katrina paused, fists clenched, &#34;Joyce just had a baby! What do you expect her to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone stayed calm. &#34;She can share a room with the baby. What&#39;s the problem with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly shook her head. &#34;That&#39;s out of the question! Joyce has always had everything she wanted.She can&#39;t stay in that small room with bad airflow. The baby is still so young, he can put up with it. And once the child gets older, we&#39;ll need more space. Joyce simply can&#39;t stay there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela just smiled lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric came out of another room, dragged a chair over, and took a seat next to Daniela.His calm presence felt like a shield of reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s usual confidence seemed to wither under his piercing gaze. She glanced at Cedric, then forced a stiff smile. &#34;Mr. Phillips, this is a family matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric returned her look with a playful grin.′′|sthat so?&#34; He didn&#39;t even move, staying completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling uncomfortable, Katrina turned to Caiden with a look that begged for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was about to ask Cedric to leave when Daniela interrupted in a cool, collected tone. &#34;This house was part of my mother&#39;s inheritance, and I&#39;m her only child.In my mother&#39;s house, I can invite whoever I want. If )some people aren&#39;t happy with that, they&#39;re welcome to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit hard, and Caiden&#39;s face twisted in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to his reaction. Katrina, irritated but trying to maintain composure in front of their guest, forced another smile, though it didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Daniela, if you&#39;re so determined. But Joyce can&#39;t move out of the room just yet. How about this?There&#39;s a nice guest room downstairs. You can stay there for now. Once the baby&#39;s a bit older,we can switch. Surely, you wouldn&#39;t take a room from a newborn and her mother, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suggestion was cleverly made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clapped her hands in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, who needed more protection than a new mother and her baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had a plan in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela would settle into the guest room for now, and later, whether she moved back or not would be entirely her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she found the guest room uncomfortable and chose to leave, that would be ideal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t one to make a fuss over things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always accepted the smallest, stuffy room upstairs without a word of protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was sure this time would be no different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed that as long as she offered Daniela a half-hearted excuse, she&#39;d quietly comply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s leave it here,&#34; Caiden said, clearly agreeing. At least, in his eyes, Daniela never stirred up trouble. &#34;Now, everyone go get cleaned up for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood up, and everyone thought the matter was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Daniela spoke again, her tone cold and composed. &#34;Feel free to eat if you want, but I&#39;ll be clearing out that room this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words took them by surprise, quickly erasing the smug expressions from their faces. Joyce blinked, staring at Danielá in shock. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to stay silent,&#34; Daniela said, her lips curling into à cold half-smile. &#34;But I&#39;ve realized there are fights worth engaging in. Otherwise, some people around here might start thinking they have control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disdain in her voice was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face turned bright red with fury. He hissed, &#34;You&#39;re such an ungrateful daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful?&#34; Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed as she turned to Caiden, her expression sharp and unwavering. &#34;If l were truly ungrateful, would you have ever married Katrina? When my mother passed,who swore he&#39;d never marry again? Were those tears of yours ever genuine? And who, in the dead of night, staged a dramatic display of sorrow, saying the senior shareholders didn&#39;t value you and your shares were too small? Who manipulated me into signing that share transfer agreement? And after that, what happened? Just days after my mother&#39;s funeral, you married Katrina. Do you have any idea what people were saying about my mother at the time? They claimed she was too controlling, that you&#39;d drifted apart from her long before. They said her strong personality wastoo much, and if she&#39;d stayed alive, you&#39;d never have achieved anything. You heard it all, didn&#39;t you? But you never said a word in her defense. Not once. So what do you really have to show for yourself? Everything you have now came from my mother. I tried to be the bigger person, tolerated your new family, and never caused any trouble here. And what did I get for it? A cramped, windowless room.And I couldn&#39;t eat at the table. I was given threadbare blankets in winter and had to walk in the rain without a ride.Joyce, on the other hand, always had a driver ready. But me? | couldn&#39;t even get someone to hold an umbrella for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to a frigid tone. &#34;You call me ungrateful, but l&#39;ve given up enough for your second chance at happiness. From now on, I won&#39;t be making any more sacrifices.&#34;</p>
