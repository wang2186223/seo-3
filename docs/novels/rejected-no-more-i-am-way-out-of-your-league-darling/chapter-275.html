                <p>Alexander was quite taken aback to see Daniela at the mall. She never liked shopping and even when chasing after him, she seldom wished to spend time with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Daniela, shopping was a complete waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle and clear amusement, she remarked, &#34;Mr. Bennett, you&#39;re concentrating on the wrong aspects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to reply, yet there she stood, ready to engage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Alexander was indifferent to her comments, but today, something changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s readiness to converse delighted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even smiled, his voice growing gentle. &#34;What do you mean? Where should my attention be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled faintly. She observed Joyce reaching up to kiss the man next to her and coyly snuggling into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Alexander inquired, noticing Daniela&#39;s silence. &#34;Why did you stop talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela redirected her gaze back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued, &#34;Where should my attention be, Daniela? I believe my focus is correct.&#34; His voice was soft and playful, touched with flirtation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric could no longer bear it and stepped in, pulling Daniela away. He sneered, &#34;What nonsense is this?Alexander, you&#39;re a married man. Shouldn&#39;t your focus be elsewhere? Do you need Daniela to teach you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood tall, meeting Cedric&#39;s glare. &#34;I am merely speaking with Daniela. It&#39;s well known that Joyce and I are incompatible. I&#39;m in the midst of divorcing her. Daniela is an extraordinary woman, and she&#39;s free to be pursued by anyone. What authority do you have to interfere?&#34; If Alexander had not spoken those words, Cedric might have remained calm. However, the mention of &#34;authority&#34; made Cedric smirk with evident satisfaction. &#34;What authority do I have? You&#39;re not worthy of an answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scoffed, &#34;To an outsider, it might seem like Daniela is already your wife. You should think before you boast,especially in her presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smirk was one of utter self-satisfaction. &#34;Her marrying me is just a matter of time. I&#39;m completely in control here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, noticing Joyce descending the stairs, quickly lost interest in her discussion with Alexander. She pulled on Cedric&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Let&#39;s go. It&#39;s time to head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela and Cedric left without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that day, after signing a contract, Alexander felt a surge of happiness, feeling a newfound closeness to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,he was restless throughout their dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Daniela tugging on Cedric&#39;s sleeve haunted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,a woman who treasured her personal space more than most, usually didn&#39;t let just anyone close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had always viewed her need for space as an intense obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But moments ago, Daniela had easily invaded that spacewith Cedric, so naturally that she might not have even realized it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze grew darker, his heart sinking deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed he had to work harder and elevate his financial status to match Daniela&#39;s before he could declare his love for her once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had not yet left the mall when she bumped into Katrina. &#34;Oh my gosh!&#34; Katrina gasped and hurriedly pulled Joyce into the women&#39;s restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce called out to the man waiting outside, &#34;Milo, wait for me.I&#39;ll be out soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was visibly upset. &#34;Joyce, have you lost your senses? Are you cheating on Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked back calmly. &#34;Why not? If Alexander won&#39;t sleep with me, someone else will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment, Katrina inhaled deeply before probing further. &#34;How much are you paying this man each month?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce raised three fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression turned to shock. &#34;You&#39;re out of your mind! I&#39;ve seen this man at a party before. He was with a woman who ended up losing everything because of him! Everyone knows about it. Weren&#39;t you aware?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce responded confidently, &#34;That won&#39;t happen to me. I&#39;m not like the rest. Besides, Milo isn&#39;t with me for my money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina scoffed at her reply. &#34;If not for money, then what? Why would you give him three million a month?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my decision,&#34; Joyce retorted. &#34;We are a couple. I get dividends each month. What&#39;s wrong with sharing a bit with him? I just want him to be comfortable. Is there anything wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,Katrina regretted her earlier decision deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she foreseen this outcome, she would not have persuaded Daniela to give Joyce those shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wealth could change people, and it was clear Joyce wasn&#39;t adept at handling it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never imagined Joyce would betray her husband like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so astonished, Mom? When you were seeing Caiden, wasn&#39;t he still married? Brylee was alive then. How is what I&#39;m doing any different from what you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused,taking a deep breath. &#34;It&#39;s different. Caiden was wealthy, and I benefited from him. What do you get from this relationship?&#34; Katrina paused, taking a deep breath.&#34;It&#39;s different. Caiden was wealthy, and I benefited from him. What do you get from this relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joy, happiness. What Alexander can&#39;t provide, he can,&#34; Joyce answered.</p>
