                <p>Once Daniela finished speaking, exhaustion overcame her, ánd she drifted into a deep slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile played on Cedric&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had been feeling uneasy since leaving home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain that Alexander&#39;s sharp instincts must have caught on to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at her. Her exit had given Alexander the opening to speak with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxious, she turned around and rushed back to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But by the time she returned, the living room was eerily quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina swallowed her unease, the thought of the  night ahead keeping her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came too soon, and Katrina rose before the sun, fatigue heavy in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she quietly slipped from her room, Daniela&#39;s door creaked open just ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina froze, her heart racing, and quickly withdrew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed hidden, waiting for the sound of footsteps descending the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally stepped out again, she saw Cedric instead of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes darted to the clock. It was five in the morning. At this hour, even the maids were still in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could have brought Cedric out of Daniela&#39;s room so early?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been there all night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or had he just arrived with the first light? A surge of unease washed over Katrina, and she made her way downstairs, halting just outside Cedric&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open just then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could avert her gaze, their eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Up this early,Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, dressed in his workout clothes, simply nodded. His expression gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he continued his path towards the door. Katrina&#39;s eyes lingered on his retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the moment, Katrina went outside to grab a glass of water, her mind still focused on Daniela&#39;s bedroom window above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That room, once Joyce&#39;s, boasted large floor-to-ceiling windows and a stunning view, perfectly centered within the villa. It was nearly a hundred square meters of space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina noticed the curtains were tightly drawn.  Daniela was clearly still resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes fell to the floor, but then a wild thought darted through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Cedric really like men? Or he only loved Daniela?Perhaps he simply wasn&#39;t interested in any woman other than Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Katrina&#39;s imagination ran wild,but she quickly shut down the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she held the belief that every man eventually strayed, so the idea of Cedric staying loyal to just one woman felt far-fetched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone as spineless as Caiden had betrayed Brylee for her back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt confident that Cedric&#39;s eyes would eventually wander towards her niece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was certain of it and decided to set the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding her phone, Katrina considered reaching out to Alexander for a meal, hoping to learn if he had uncovered anything the day before and told Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she feared that seeming too eager might reveal some of her own hidden truths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she turned to Joyce, who was still asleep well into the afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s reaction to Katrina&#39;s suggestion was immediate-her face twisted with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, can&#39;t you stop being so self-centered? I just divorced Alexander, and now you want me to go back to him? What kind of excuse would I even give? What would people think of me? Have you even thought about that? Milo would get upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood up, snatched her purse off the cabinet,and added, &#34;And don&#39;t act like you forgot-you still owe me eight million. You can&#39;t just pretend that never happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared at Joyce in disbelief. &#34;Didn&#39;t Alexander just hand you fifty million? Are you seriously claiming  you&#39;re still broke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been putting money into a business with Milo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of business made Katrina uneasy.&#34;Joyce, you&#39;re no business expert. What do you even know about running a company? How could you invest in that? Don&#39;t let yourself be duped!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop doubting me, Mom. You always think I&#39;m incapable, but Milo says I&#39;m actually clever. I&#39;ve just been waiting for the right moment. Now that it&#39;s here, I&#39;m not going to let it pass me by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;And just how much did you put in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed a small investment, maybe one or two million at most. However, Joyce raised her fingers in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s chest tightened. &#34;Four million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce burst into laughter. &#34;Mom, are you serious?What&#39;s four million going to do for me? I put in forty-five million. Milo promised a huge return. I know you  never believed in me, always thinking I&#39;m foolish, but just wait. I&#39;ll bring in a fortune before long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce turned and made her way towards the door. As she passed, she shot a final reminder at her collapsing mother. &#34;And don&#39;t forget-eight million is still on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out with a confident stride, leaving Katrina&#39;s mind spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, Katrina dialed the number of a private investigator she knew, requesting him to dig into the company Joyce had mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surveying the empty space around her, Katrina realized how isolated she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on the phone tightened as her anxiety intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t settle, her nerves frayed, until finally,Daniela emerged from upstairs. Trembling, Katrina rushed towards her, pleading, &#34;Daniela, please. You haveto help me this time.&#34;</p>
