                <p>Alexander hesitated and didn&#39;t dare to take another step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew all too well that his family&#39;s businesses were deeply tied to Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on impulse might feel satisfying in the moment, but the consequences would be disastrous.How could he face his family afterward?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wiped the blood from his lips with the back of his hand, his face flushed with humiliation.Without saying another word, he began to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he made his first move, Cedric&#39;s icy voice rang out, stopping him in his tracks. &#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spun around, his expression cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze locked onto him, and his voice was sharp. &#34;Earlier, you questioned whether Daniela was my property and why I had any say in her life. Let me set you straight. Daniela is not my property. But from this moment on, anyone who dares to harm her will have to answer to me first. Don&#39;t even thnk about dragging the Harper family back into her life. I couldn&#39;t care less who they are-every one of them will deal with me. And as for you-don&#39;t come here acting like you suddenly care about her.You had your chance when she was your wife. Now? It&#39;s too late for any of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tilted his head, his eyes briefly turning upward to the security camera overhead. Without breaking his intense stare, he turned to Ryan and gave a firm command. &#34;Upload the footage to every platform and make it the hottest topic everywhere. I want the world to hear this. Daniela has someone who cares for her, someone who will fight for her. From now on,she&#39;ll have the life she deserves. Every tear she sheds will be one of happiness, not from putting up with scum like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ryan and the rest of the group erupted into applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression contorted in embarrassment as he turned and hobbled off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, social media went wild. The servers nearly crashed from the overwhelming surge of traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leading headline, clear and direct, declared,&#34;Daniela Has Someone Who Cares About Her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words were enough to set off a worldwide storm, accumulating billions of views and a flood of comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This could be right out of a romance novel. His protectiveness is off the charts-total CEO-in-love energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Cedric just declare his love for Daniela to the world? This has to be a confession, right? Please tell me I&#39;m not imagining tis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to tell me this is just a &#39;friendship&#39; thing-l won&#39;t buy it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to be love! OMG, I&#39;m melting. I believe in love again because of this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in tears. Daniela&#39;s been through so much, but now, finally, she has someone by her side. Cedric and Daniela are my new favorite couple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela truly deserves this. Her father never loved her, her mother passed away, her ex-husband was cruel, and her stepsister stabbed her in the back,but now she has Cedric. Every ounce of suffering she endured brought her to this point. It was all worth it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t Cedric supposed to be the &#39;cold,untouchable CEO&#39;? The &#39;stone-faced, allergic-to-women&#39; type? Seems like he was just waiting for Daniela all along!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OMG, where is Daniela? Why hasn&#39;t she said anything yet? I need some updates now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the comments flooded in, the hashtag took over every platform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Daniela stayed quiet and offered no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the Bennett family became the target of public mockery, their reputation being dragged through the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard spent the whole night compulsively checking the second trending topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander Takes a Hit and Does Nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments were harsh, ripping into both Alexander and the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, this guy is revolting! Alexander, was it? What does the Bennett family even do? Whatever it is, I&#39;m done with them for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a joke! Daniela literally told him the shop was on basement level one. But instead of clearing things up with Joyce, this spineless guy let the whole misunderstanding blow up. Now Daniela&#39;s been slapped, cut off from her family, and here comes Alexander, acting like some big shot, offering to pay for Joyce&#39;s shop rent. Where was this &#39;generosity&#39;when it actually counted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I watched the surveillance footage and almost lost my lunch. Alexander, are you seriously this shameless? You completely overlooked Daniela when she was just a regular woman. But now that she&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux, you&#39;re suddenly crawling out of the woodwork? And offering to take her to dinner? What,you think she needs your charity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, check this out-I just found a clip where Richard straight up says Daniela wasn&#39;t &#39;good enough&#39; to marry into the Bennett family. And he said it in public! Richard&#39;s been dismissing her for years,acting like she&#39;d only ever be some pretty, useless trophy wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It all makes sense now. Elite Lux just bought the largest plot of land in the Northern District to develop a commercial center. The Bennetts are in construction and renovation. Now they&#39;re clearly desperate to collaborate with her That&#39;s why they&#39;re back, offering dinner invites!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Underneath all these furious comments, one word kept popping up, bold and loud. &#34;Scumbag!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stood by the tall windows in his study, his back straight, fists tightly clenched behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath,trying to steady the growing storm of anger inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around to face Alexander, his tone hard and unforgiving. &#34;I don&#39;t care what it takes. You will fix your relationship with Daniela. You&#39;ll make sure we secure that partnership with Phillips Group. Do you understand? The North District project is vital,and we can&#39;t afford to lose it! And what&#39;s going on with those trending topics? They&#39;ve been live for hours,making this family look like fools! Are you so incompetent that you can&#39;t even get them taken down?&#34;1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander closed his eyes briefly. &#34;I&#39;ve tried.The trending topics were pinned by a hacker. Even the admins can&#39;t take them down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp sound of a slap rang out through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Idiot!&#34; Richard spat. &#34;You better listen carefully. Do whatever it takes. Meet with Daniela. Clean up this mess. Lock in that partnership.&#34;</p>
