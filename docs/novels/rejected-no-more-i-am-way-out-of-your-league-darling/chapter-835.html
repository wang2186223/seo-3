                <p>Cedric frowned when he looked over the contract. &#34;Why is my name listed under the partner&#39;s section?Shouldn&#39;t that be Daniela&#39;s company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shrugged. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. You&#39;ll have to ask Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he turned to do that, Cedric caught sight of Alexander walking in with someone unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; said Carol, stepping closer.&#34;Who&#39;s that guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked around. One of the guards answered, &#34;He said he&#39;s Mr. Bennett&#39;s new secretary. Name&#39;s Arthur Lopez.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arthur?&#34; Cedric had never heard that name before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he went upstairs, both Alexander and Arthur were already inside the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused at the doorway and took a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wore a light gray suit and looked like he was in his forties. Behind his thick glasses, his sharp gaze barely moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t speak to Alexander. Just kept scribbling on a piece of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Carol. She got the cue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she passed by Arthur&#39;s chair, she slowed just enough to catch a glimpse. He was sketching some kind of chart. Nothing she recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spoke first, laying out the goals of the partnership, the process, and the benefits both sides could expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paid attention, jotting down notes. Then she paused. She felt someone watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and met Arthur&#39;s eyes. He gave her a faint, unreadable smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod and returned to the documents in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Cedric kept his eyes on Arthur. Not once did the man look at Alexander. Every time,his gaze was locked on Daniela. He kept writing, slow and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the meeting, Cedric stood up and passed behind Arthur. His eyes caught something odd. The paper was covered in small black dots. No text. No lines. Just dots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric studied them as long as he could, but they didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped into the hallway, pulled out his phone, and started looking up anything that might explain the markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Carol joined him. She crossed her arms, clearly irritated. &#34;That guy gives me a weird feeling.I tried asking him about the project, but he said he was new and didn&#39;t know much yet. So why is he even in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;He&#39;s been watching Daniela too closely. It&#39;s not casual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a small nod. &#34;I noticed it too. He&#39;s staring at her like he&#39;s studying her. The way he looks at her-it&#39;s cold. Makes my skin crawl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his head and looked through the glass into the meeting room. Arthur was still seated, still writing in that same notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if he felt Cedric&#39;s eyes on him, Arthur looked up, met Cedric&#39;s eyes, adjusted his glasses using the same hand that held his pen. then looked back down and kept writing-like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes and flagged down someone from Lone Wolf. &#34;Take a look at this for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toward the end of the meeting, he walked back into the room holding a pot of coffee, &#34;accidentally&#34; spilling it all over Arthur&#39;s notebook. Arthur jolted in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly set the pot down. &#34;Are you alright? I&#39;m terribly sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur moved his leg and looked up at Cedric, but his expression didn&#39;t match the apology. There was a flicker of something darker behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meeting cleared out, Cedric and Carol pulled Daniela aside. &#34;That guy&#39;s not right,&#34; he said,holding out the paper marked with dots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied the pattern but didn&#39;t recognize it. &#34;If we match this to what I got last night,it lines up. He&#39;s probably the one Hamilton sent to find out my weaknesses. He doesn&#39;t ask anything about the project. But he tracks every move I make. That says more than anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela&#39;s words, Cedric felt a chill crawl down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked uneasy. &#34;What should we do now? He&#39;s not going to find your weaknesses, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed calm. &#34;They&#39;re not sure yet. They&#39;re just guessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced toward Cedric, then leaned in to whisper something to Carol. &#34;Get some tranquilizer ready for me.&#34; Carol gave a nod and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned back to Cedric. &#34;It&#39;s alright. Even if they figure something out, I&#39;ll be fine. The tranquilizer will keep things under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clenched his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t how business was supposed to be done. Tactics like this had no place in a boardroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t thought much of the McCoy family before, but now he was certain-they&#39;d crossed the line. Going after her like this? It was cowardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; said Cedric, voicelow and tight. &#34;But I&#39;m not letting anything happen to you. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood close enough to feel the heat rolling off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t scared. Not really. But seeing Cedric like that stirred something in her. He was angry. Protective. And all of it was for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always taken care of herself. But hearing someone else step up to shield her? It felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric left, his expression hard. He called out to Mose. &#34;Dig into every last person in the McCoy family. I want a full list of their weaknesses. All of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they wanted to play dirty, then fine. He could match them move for move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose, who rarely saw Cedric like this, raised an eyebrow and smirked. &#34;You&#39;re really fired up. Not like you to get worked up over someone who&#39;s not Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s teeth ground together. &#34;They&#39;re targeting my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose let out a short laugh. &#34;Your wife? Seriously? Who&#39;s dumb enough to try that?&#34;</p>
