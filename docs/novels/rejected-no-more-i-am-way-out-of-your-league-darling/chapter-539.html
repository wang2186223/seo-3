                <p>Bringing gifts to Daniela was nothing more than a gesture of respect for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at Elite Lux, Bruno made sure Cedric had already departed before rushing upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he neared his destination, Ryan and Lillian blocked his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;What&#39;s the meaning of this?Step aside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian folded her arms, her gaze cold. &#34;And what exactly do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno hoisted the bags slightly. &#34;I&#39;m dropping off gifts,isn&#39;t it obvious? Lend me a hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Bruno, Lillian was nothing more than a mere secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t budge, his temper flared. He jabbed a finger at her. &#34;You&#39;re just a secretary! Who gave you the guts to talk back? Do you even realize how easily I could ruin you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down,Bruno never saw women as his equals. In his mind, they existed only to serve his whims.Respect? That was laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are high-end luxury goods, worth millions.Take them to Daniela&#39;s office-and be careful! You couldn&#39;t afford to replace them if you tried!&#34; he spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passing janitor, oblivious to the tension, casually carried the gifts into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s smugness swelled. He sauntered in, let his gaze wander critically around the room, then lowered himself onto the sofa, preparing to cross his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could settle in, Lillian&#39;s steady voice rang out. &#34;Bruno Deleon is inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Daniela stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno sprang to his feet, flashing a practiced smile.&#34;Ms. Harper, my apologies for dropping by unannounced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words carried an apology, but his expression certainly did not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile was forced, his eyes laced with barely concealed contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you need?&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t waste time with niceties. She simply walked past him and took her seat. Bruno hesitated, expecting an invitation to sit,but none came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation prickled at him, but he couldn&#39;t let it show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a chuckle, he lowered himself into the seat.&#34;Yesterday, I let my mouth run and said some things l shouldn&#39;t have. I came to apologize. And I hope you&#39;ll like these gifts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave them a brief glance, then let out a soft chuckle. &#34;And what makes you think I&#39;d like them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response nearly made Bruno choke on air. These gifts were worth a fortune! And she had the nerve to say she didn&#39;t like them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was in a bit of a rush.&#34; Fishing a check from his pocket, he extended it forward. &#34;Please accept this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave it a glance, a faint smirk playing on her lips.The same two-hundred-million-dollar check from the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, we&#39;re all businesspeople. No need to make things so difficult. Think of this as a goodwill gesture,&#34;he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back slightly, her tone measured. &#34;And what exactly do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s eyes gleamed with anticipation. He believed Cedric was the real power behind all this. Daniela? She was just a pretty face. But with Cedric wrapped around her finger,she held influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, what he said was the opposite. &#34;Last night,Mr. Phillips took extreme action against my company,leading to severe losses. Could you have a word with him? Ask him to ease up a little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, plucking the check off the table. &#34;If my memory serves me right, Cedric mentioned a hundred billion dollars yesterday, didn&#39;t he? And if l recall correctly, you lost around eighty billion last night. Had you acted sooner, you wouldn&#39;t have ended up paying this much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno swallowed his pride, his jaw tightening. &#34;Yes,I was foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unhurriedly, Daniela placed the check back on the table and slid it toward him. &#34;Cedric told me this morning-he gave you a chance yesterday, and you didn&#39;t take it. Now? A hundred billion won&#39;t cut it. It&#39;s a trillion. So, are you going to come up with it,or pretend this meeting never happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer number nearly made Bruno choke. &#34;A trillion? You can&#39;t be serious! Even if all eight of us pooled our wealth, we wouldn&#39;t have that much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice remained unhurried. &#34;But you haven&#39;t even tried. How can you be so sure?&#34; Ultimately, Lillian tossed both Bruno and his gifts right out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scram! Who do you think you are, acting all high and mighty? Please! When I was spending millions like pocket change,you were still scraping by in the slums!&#34;she mocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A powerful business mogul, yet here he was-thrown out like a nobody. Onlookers gawked, and some even pulled out their phones to record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nightfall, Bruno&#39;s humiliation had become industry gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word spread like wildfire-Bruno Deleon was tossed out of Elite Lux by a secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a dimly lit private lounge, Bruno fumed at the remaining seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t been humiliated like this in years! Daniela is insufferable! Absolutely unbearable! What now? Does she run the market? She demands a hundred billion,and we just hand it over? She demands a trillion, and we magically find it? Who does she think she is? It&#39;s all because of Cedric! She acts untouchable now, but back when she was chasing after Alexander, wasn&#39;t she meek and submissive? Hackett! Say something!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett,silent until now, narrowed his eyes and turned to Bruno. Bruno frowned. &#34;What are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett smirked. &#34;Even the most powerful men have their weaknesses-especially for beautiful women.If we can&#39;t sway Daniela, we need someone else in Cedric&#39;s ear. Someone loyal to us, and utterly irresistible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno blinked in disbelief. &#34;Isn&#39;t Daniela exactly that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what they thought of her, they had to admit-Daniela was stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a knowing chuckle. &#34;No matter how beautiful she is, I&#39;m sure Cedric would get bored.Bruno, that beauty you&#39;ve been keeping under wraps might be just the answer.&#34;</p>
