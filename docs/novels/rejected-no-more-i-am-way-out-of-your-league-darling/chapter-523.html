                <p>Daniela nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Marc stepped into the room, carrying a gift. &#34;Ms. Harper, it&#39;s been a while. Just a small token of appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely glanced at the gift. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc knew Daniela had little patience for small talk or needless conversation, which only added to her enigmatic nature. People like her were the hardest to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a short, nervous chuckle. &#34;Well, there&#39;s something I need to discuss with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded again. &#34;Then get to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc swallowed hard. &#34;The cost of raw materials has risen recently. So, would you consider raising our price?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm as she looked at Marc. &#34;We have a contract, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc nodded quickly. &#34;WVe do. But business has been rough, and I&#39;m in a tight spot. Could you consider a little flexibility, maybe a slight percent increase?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian rested against the doorframe, her gaze fixed on Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained unfazed. &#34;How much are you asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc licked his lips nervously. &#34;Just twenty percent.&#34; He stole a glance at Daniela, but her expression remained unreadable. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a badge.&#34;I&#39;d also like to invite you to join the National Commerce Association. This is the badge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the badge, then met his gaze with a faint smile. &#34;I understand what you&#39;re asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc exhaled in relief, thinking he&#39;d completed his mission. &#34;If you no longer wish to continue our partnership,that&#39;s finn1′′Daniela added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s smile stiffened. &#34;No, no, that&#39;s not what I meant,&#34; he stammered, panic creeping into his voice.&#34;We can renegotiate the price. And as for the association, at least consider joining. We&#39;re very sincere about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc was about to speak again when Daniela slowly lifted her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stood still, frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had meticulously prepared for this meeting, envisioning countless possible responses from Daniela and crafting the perfect replies for each. But he hadn&#39;t anticipated this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply stated, &#34;Our partnership with you ends today. Lillian, please show him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s mouth was wide agape. &#34;Ms. Harper, please, listen! I wasn&#39;t trying to threaten you! I just wanted to persuade you. The association offers real benefits. Please, give me another chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian picked up the phone and called security. She tossed the badge out along with Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, Elite Lux&#39;s official website announced the termination of its contract with Marc&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news spread fast, shaking the entire association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was astonished as no one had expected Daniela to be so ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A partnership worth billions a year was terminated just like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No negotiations, no second chances?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stormed into Hackett&#39;s office, fuming. Hackett, however, merely smiled, consoling him. &#34;Relax. Just wait. How long do you think Elite Lux will last without a major supplier like you? Women make impulsive decisions. Give it time. She&#39;ll come crawling back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very evening,Hackett paid Daniela a visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just stepped out of her car when he intercepted her. &#34;Daniela, was that necessary? I was an old friend of your mother&#39;s. We&#39;ve known each other for years. Why would you make this unpleasant? I have only one request. Call off your acquisition plans, or at the very least,leave our association members out of it. Let&#39;s move forward without bad blood. Otherwise, Marc will be just the first. More companies will walk away, one after another. Elite Lux may be powerful, but it&#39;s still finding its footing in the domestic market. Its foundation isn&#39;t äs solid as you think. Who will stand by you then? Take my advice, play fair, and the road ahead will be much smoother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling, Daniela sidestepped Hackett and walked into the Elite Lux building without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contrary to Hackett&#39;s predictions, Elite Lux stood firm. Not only did it maintain its supply chain, but Marc&#39;s company was the first to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s business was vast, and the association members&#39; contributions were nothing more than a drop in the ocean. They couldn&#39;t make up for Marc&#39;s losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Marc rushed to Elite Lux, hoping to see Daniela but instead, he found Cedric tending to a row of lush green plants in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, please, could you put in a good word for me? Tell Ms. Harper we&#39;re willing to stick to the original contract and continue our partnership. We can talk about joining the association later. Please, help me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked up, mildly surprised. &#34;You&#39;re too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s stomach twisted. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled faintly. &#34;Were you not aware? When Elite Lux entered this market, it had already built its own raw material processing plant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc waved his hands frantically. &#34;That&#39;s impossible. I checked! There was no plant. And we signed a non-compete agreement. Elite Lux wasn&#39;t allowed to process its own raw materials. Ms. Harper knows that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded: &#34;That&#39;s true, but Daniela has me. My company never signed a non-compete with you. So,when you terminated your contract with Elite Lux, we stepped in and sealed the deal. You&#39;re really out of the loop. It&#39;s been days, and you&#39;re still living in denial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stumbled back a few steps, his eyes wide in disbelief. Without wasting a second, he ordered his team to investigate the company Cedric had mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Marc broke down right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He collapsed at Daniela&#39;s office door, sobbing, &#34;Ms. Harper, please give me another chance! I swear I won&#39;t threaten you again! I won&#39;t raise prices anymore! I was misled! I can&#39;t survive without Elite Lux&#39;s orders.Please, I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela never showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s company&#39;s funds dried up. Investors pulled out one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five days later, the once-thriving company declared bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his bankruptcy was finalized, Marc turned to Hackett, clinging to a last shred of hope for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hackett merely smiled and said, &#34;There&#39;s no room for you in this game anymore. Coming to me won&#39;t change that. If you need someone to blame, look in the mirror and blame yourself for being stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Marc tragically ended his own life by throwing himself off the association&#39;s headquarters.He was dead on impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Hackett instructed his staff to take care of the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Daniela continued her expansion, securing another acquisition under the association&#39;s umbrella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire association fell into a state of silent, suffocating fear.</p>
