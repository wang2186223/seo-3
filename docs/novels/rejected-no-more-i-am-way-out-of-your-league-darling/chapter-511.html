                <p>To Joyce,Cedric was like a distant star, brilliant, radiant, but forever out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her mother stil held the power of the Harper family, she had once believed there was hope for her to be with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she plummeted to rock bottom, she abandoned those extravagant dreams though a twinge of regret would creep into her heart occasionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with her newfound power, those long-buried desires stirred once more, rising bit by bit like embers reigniting into flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flowers before her were the first flicker of that hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies,&#34; Daniela said smiling and picked up the flowers from the table. &#34;We&#39;re not done with them just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had been on the brink of happiness, only for Daniela to steal it away with a single, unwavering gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce barely managed to suppress the fury on her face at that moment. Who did Daniela think she was to challenge that? For over a decade, she had basked in favor, while Daniela had been the ignored one. And now, Daniela dared to flaunt her power in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression darkened with fury, but she forced herself to maintain her composure. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t be so petty! It&#39;s just some flowers and you can&#39;t even spare them for mne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted a flower to her nose, breathing in its delicate fragrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a gift from my husband. Every flower holds meaning for me. I can&#39;t give it away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sucked in a sharp breath, her chest tightening as she locked eyes with Daniela, the bitter realization sinking in that she had no way to argue against Daniela. So she turned to Cedric instead, her voice softening into something almost pleading. &#34;Cedric, you promised earlier that you&#39;d give me the flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried the same entitlement she&#39;d always wielded as a child when she used totake things from Daniela, knowing she had Caiden&#39;s favoritism on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the woman before her was no longer the same girl from their childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Cedric was surely not Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please forgive me,&#34; Cedric said evenly,&#34;but this is a gift I gave to my wife. I have no right to give it away.However, if you like, I can have my secretary get you the contact information of the florist&#39;s shop. You can buy them yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips as she watched Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to reveal her true feelings, Joyce could only swallow her anger and remain composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Daniela and muttered begrudgingly, &#34;I expect an update in three days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, she spun on her heel and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the further she walked, the more unwilling she felt. As she stepped into the elevator, an idea ignited in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping away from prying eyes, she sought out one of the cleaning staff at Elite Lux and pulled out a wad of cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lied to the cleaner, &#34;I really like the flowers in Daniela&#39;s office. I&#39;ll pay you ten thousand if you get them for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaner&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, clearly conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce raised two fingers.&#34;Twenty thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaner stared, dumbfounded. &#34;Twenty thousand? You must be joking. Or are the flowers worth millions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if it was Daniela&#39;s, it had to be priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce scoffed. &#34;The flowers are nothing special. You can find them everywhere. I just think flowers from Daniela&#39;s office could bring in good luck. You know how businesspeople are. They all believe in these things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce grabbed the cleaner&#39;s phone and, without hesitation, transferred thirty thousand. &#34;It&#39;s just some flowers. You can get them for me, can&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaner stared at the money in her account. The temptation was too great. Finally, she nodded hesitantly. &#34;Ms. Harper&#39;s pretty easygoing. She won&#39;t make a fuss even if something goes missing. Give me your address, and I&#39;ll deliver the flowers tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face lit up with delight. &#34;I&#39;ll wait downstairs, no matter how late it gets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, the cleaner lingered until the last employee had left the Elite Lux building. Concealing the flowers within a garbage cart, she maneuvered it past the security guards, slipping out unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce could hardly believe her luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had actually managed to get her hands on the flowers that Cedric had carefully chosen himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Joyce&#39;s eyes as she cradled the flowers. It felt like she had spent her whole life chasing an unattainable dream. But now, at last, it was within her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with joy, Joyce sent the cleaner an extra fifty thousand before carrying the flowers home, her heart overflowing with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander saw Joyce walk in, cradling the flowers, he strode towards her, but she dismissed him,not even bothering to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not spending the night with you. I have things to take care of. Now leave and don&#39;t forget to close the door behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood at the foot of the stairs, his expression unreadable as his gaze lingered on her in silence. He had come to remind Joyce of her promise, to transfer the Fairburne Group shares after Doug&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was clear she had completely forgotten. Joyce&#39;s excited voice echoed through the halls, brimming with delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got some flowers! Find someone who knows plants and send them to my house immediately!&#34; Her voice overflowed with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze darkened, his eyes turning cold and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, when Alexander came, he found Joyce still doting over the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overwatering them. If you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll kill them,&#34; Alexander said flatly, putting deliberate weight on the word &#34;kill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was so engrossed in tending to the flowers she failed to notice it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice grew even colder. &#34;You promised a cut of the shares of Fairburne Group.. When do you plan to transfer them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chuckled, her gaze never straying from the flower. &#34;Alexander, do you really think owning those shares will make Daniela see you any differently? You&#39;re insignificant compared to Cedric. What makes you think she&#39;ll ever love you again? All this effort you&#39;re putting is nothing but a futile game. Even if I handed you every last share, it wouldn&#39;t change a thing. Daniela will never love you again. It&#39;s time you accept the truth,Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes darkened as he stared at Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dagger slipped from coat sleeve, settling effortlessly into his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped to a chilling whisper. &#34;How will I know if I don&#39;t try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had once loved him wholeheartedly, and he refused to believe she could now be so utterly heartless.</p>
