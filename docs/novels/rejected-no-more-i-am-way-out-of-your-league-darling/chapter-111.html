                <p>Richard had been on edge lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t get his hands on the land in the North District, and Daniela had flat-out refused to meet Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, things with Joyce had completely fallen apart,leaving no opportunity for reconciliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed as though he was trapped in a losing battle,with no way to turn things around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the sketchbook in his hands, his eyes fixed on it. Days had passed, yet he couldn&#39;t pinpoint what set it apart from Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Alexander paced restlessly back and forth,his mind visibly preoccupied. His thoughts circled around whether Daniela suspected he was the person from their shared past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she did, there was no trace of the warmth she used to show him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t, her straightforward nature would have likely prompted her to confront him outright. Her indifferent attitude left him unsure of what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander never thought he&#39;d find himself in a position where he had to guess what was going on in Daniela&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in his musings, Alexander didn&#39;t notice Keith stepping in through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith greeted Richard, but his words went unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat beside Alexander, Keith leaned in and asked, &#34;Hey, did you hear? Daniela&#39;s gone and purchased lands in both the South and East Districts.She&#39;sunstoppable!lsshe building her own empire now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes flew open in shock. &#34;What? She&#39;s acquired more land?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Keith confirmed, his attention turning to Alexander&#39;s phone, where a photo of a note displayed the message, &#34;Let&#39;s meet tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the handwriting struck him as familiar, so he picked up the phone for a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, Richard turned to Alexander with urgency. &#34;Alexander, you have to grab this chance!&#34;His voice shook with a mix of excitement and nerves. He hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to be so wealthy,let alone imagined another shot at securing the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To top it off, the South and East Districts had a larger building area than the North, which meant they promised even bigger profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, you have to act fast and tell Daniela you want the building rights for those plots. Securing them will skyrocket Bennett Group&#39;s financials for the next five years. Don&#39;t let Cedric swoop in and snatch them away from you!&#34; Richard&#39;s impassioned plea appeared to light a spark in Keith&#39;s thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,Cedric!&#34; Keith exclaimed with a booming laugh,pointing at Alexander&#39;s phone. &#34;That handwriting-it&#39;s Cedric&#39;s!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith slapped Alexander&#39;s thigh enthusiastically.&#34;Remember when we visited that celebrity exhibition in the city? There was a whole section about Cedric,showing his rise to fame, and even a childhood notebook where he practiced writing. You pointed out something then-that Cedric had this quirky habit of adding a dot in the bottom right corner of the last letter on every page.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith gestured towards the dot in the corner.&#34;See?The handwriting matches perfectly, and so does that little dot! It&#39;s unmistakable, right?&#34; When Keith looked up, his laughter abruptly faded.Both Richard and Alexander were staring at him with expressions far too serious for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Keith asked, his confusion evident as he scratched his head. &#34;Why are you so interested in Cedric&#39;s handwriting? What&#39;s the big deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Richard&#39;s face, which had been flushed with excitement just moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the stark glare of the lights, his complexion now resembled a ghostly shade of white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith was just about to crack a joke to ease the tension when Richard suddenly leaned back, collapsing to the floor with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room instantly descended into chaos. When the paramedics arrived, Alexander didn&#39;t hesitate to climb into the ambulance with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors shut, he locked eyes with Keith and said in a chillingly firm tone, &#34;This stays between us. Don&#39;t say a word to anyone!&#34;</p>
