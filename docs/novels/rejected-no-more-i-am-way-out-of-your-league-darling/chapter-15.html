                <p>Revealed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce burst into uncontrollable laughter, her body shaking as she nearly folded over from the sheer hilarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander extended a hand to steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce faced the camera and exclaimed, &#34;Guys, if Daniela&#39;s really the CEO of Elite Lux, I&#39;ll eat a fresh pile of crap for dessert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua stood to the side, his jaw dropping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inviting Joyce had been his call, but now unease crept in, the thought of upsetting Daniela making his heart race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a storm in his stride, Joshua marched up to Joyce and delivered a stinging slap across her face. &#34;Have you lost your fucking mind?&#34; s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laughter vanished from Joyce&#39;s face,replaced by a stunned silence. She touched her swelling cheek,staring at Joshua in utter disbelief. &#34;Why did you hit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fiery glare and a low growl, Joshua spat, &#34;What the hell is wrong with you? She&#39;s the freaking CEO of Elite Lux, and you&#39;re sitting here spouting nonsense about eating crap? Where is your sense of decorum?I told you to bring a gift, not insults. Where is the gift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flickered towards the two boxes Alexander clutched in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pointed to the less expensive of the two,priced at eight thousand dollars. &#34;That one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Joshua yanked the box, gripped Joyce&#39;s arm, and went straight for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a strained smile plastered on his face, he began,&#34;Ms. Harper, please accept my apologies for the disruption. This is my friend, Joyce Holt. We crossed paths overseas a few years back.&#34; He tapped his temple lightly, his expression awkward as he went on,&#34;She&#39;s a bit out of sorts today. Nevertheless,she&#39;s one of your ardent admirers and even brought a present for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he lifted the lid of the box, an eight-thousand-dollar golf club was revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one glance at the contents, Joshua&#39;s expression grew grim. He shot a quick, piercing look at Joyce,then at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, on the other hand, let out a chuckle as she picked up the golf club. &#34;An admirer, you say? This club...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the price tag, a wy smile creeping across her features. &#34;Eight thousand dollars...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red-faced and clearly flustered, Joshua shoved the golf club into the box. &#34;I&#39;m so terribly sorry, MMs.Harper. These two, well, their judgment can be a bit off at times!&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then spun around to confront Joyce, his voice thick with frustration.2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce! Are you seriously this clueless? This is Ms.Harper, the CEO of Elite Lux! Her empire includes golf courses that stretch over thousands of acres, and here you are offering her a golf club worth a mere 8,000dollars. Are you out of your damn mind? This is simply outrageous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fluster, Joshua scrambled for the other box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon opening it, his features relaxed, a look of relief washing over him. Now, this was a gift befitting the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both hands, he presented the box to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who had so far seemed unimpressed, now raised an eyebrow, her eyes glinting with a touch of irony as she inspected the box. She reached into the box and drew out a stunning,custom-tailored golf club, its flawless finish radiating sophistication. Joshua added, &#34;Ms. Harper, please consider the first one just a small extra token. This right here is the true gift meant for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a golf enthusiast, Joshua immediately recognized its value-it was worth at least ten million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged subtly at the corners of Daniela&#39;s mouth as she studied the club. &#34;Is this golf club really for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she saw the club, recognition washed over her-it was the very gift she had bestowed upon Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face clouded over. He remained silent,choosing not to answer Daniela&#39;s query.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, a golf club was merely a piece of sports equipment. Surely,Daniela couldn&#39;t actually recognize this specific one,could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pointed at the grip of the club, where the surname &#34;Bennett&#34; was elegantly engraved. &#34;I didn&#39;t know the Bennett family was involved in making golf clubs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Joshua suddenly stiffened, his smile faltering completely. He peered down at the golf club, and a crimson flush spread across his face.Seriously, even the dumbest person alive would know this club was custom-made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Re-gifting, huh?&#34; Daniela pressed, her voice even but laced with unmistakable sarcasm. &#34;Mr. Bennett,you certainly have a talent for business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua was taken aback. Having just returned from overseas, he was utterly baffled by Daniela&#39;s insinuation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Lillian stepped in, her fingers wrapping around the club&#39;s handle. &#34;If Mr. Bennett is going to treat our boss&#39;s generosity like trash, then we&#39;re more than entitled to take it back.&#34; She brought the golf club back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere turned excruciatingly tense, the silence bearing down like a merciless weight,suffocating any chance of recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only disruption was Joyce, muttering incredulously to herself, &#34;What the hell? How on earth could this even be possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t accept the revelation that Daniela, of all people,was the CEO of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was disowned and discarded by her own father,Caiden. How on earth had she ascended to such heights?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s mind reeled from the shock. With a brittle chuckle, she turned to Joshua, desperation coloring her tone. &#34;Joshua, come on, cut the act. How much did Daniela pay you to concoct this elaborate prank?It&#39;s not amusing in the slightest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua&#39;s cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson,his discomfort palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze was dark and inscrutable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the internet, the announcement about Elite Lux set off a frenzy, with everyone buzzing in excitement and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone, look at this! Elite Lux just dropped a bombshell on their official site!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elite Lux is branching out! They&#39;re penetrating the domestic scene, spearheaded by none other than their CEO, Daniela Harper. She&#39;s leading the charge into Olisvine. The company is all praises and is rooting for her success!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling quiet enveloped the room, the air so heavy it seemed to stifle even the faintest sound. Every gaze was fixed on Elite Lux&#39;s official announcement, expressions ranging from shock to disbelief-everyone except Joyce, who seemed oddly unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! Daniela, look at you,all high and mighty! You even went so far as to hack Elite Lux&#39;s official site to spread your fake news. Just wait till they catch on and hit you with a lawsuit!&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter rang out, bordering on maniacal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her laughter echoed, she caught the sober stare of everyone around her.</p>
