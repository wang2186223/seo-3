                <p>Katrina narrowed her eyes. &#34;You two are out shopping in such a public place. Aren&#39;t you concerned about running into Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Joyce responded with confidence. &#34;Alexander is on a business trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was startled by this. &#34;Joyce! How could you be so careless? I just saw Alexander. He mentioned he&#39;s heading upstairs for dinner. How do you not know whether your husband is on a business trip or not? If you cheat on him, he&#39;s sure to divorce you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gave a nonchalant shrug. &#34;If he wants a divorce, that&#39;s fine by me. I&#39;mn financially stable and there are plenty of other options out there. I don&#39;t need to cling to Alexander. He doesn&#39;t love me, anyway. Don&#39;t worry, Mom. I know what I&#39;m doing. Milo is waiting for me outside. I have to go.&#34; With that, she fixed her hair in the mirror and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression turned to one of disapproval. Losing interest in shopping, she headed straight home to wait for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric, feeling the movie outing was lackluster, decided to return home and watch a film in Daniela&#39;s room instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he opened the villa door, he was surprised to see Katrina there without Johan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grave look, she addressed Daniela. &#34;Daniela, I need a moment with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression soured immediately. Why was it so difficult to have a private moment with his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Cedric a reassuring smile, then told Katrina, &#34;Wait a moment.&#34; She then guided Cedric upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still bewildered when Katrina stood and addressed Daniela sharply. &#34;How long must I wait? I have something important to say.&#34; &#34;You&#39;ll need to wait until I&#39;m done here before we can talk,&#34; Daniela responded without turning,her tone dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was then escorted back to Daniela&#39;s room. He lingered there, gazing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being taller, he felt overwhelmed in her presence, as though she could easily swayhim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela motioned Cedric into the room and met his gaze silently, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her intense stare, Cedric&#39;s earlier irritation melted away. He asked softly, &#34;What&#39;s troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you seem upset?&#34; Daniela inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric averted his eyes, replying, &#34;I&#39;m not upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Affirming, Cedric said, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then rose slightly on her toes and kissed him gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a brief kiss, but it sent a shiver down Cedric&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he looked at her, Daniela questioned him again, &#34;Why are you upset?&#34; Her expression was cool and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, gathering his resolve, countered, &#34;You&#39;re my wife. Is it wrong to show my feelings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply looked at him. She then tiptoed again and delivered a longer, more meaningful kiss. &#34;Still upset?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued to kiss him, soothing his feigned distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Katrina&#39;s patience was wearing thin. She quietly asked the maid, &#34;What are they possibly discussing upstairs for so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid, not bothered by the inquiry, answered, &#34;They&#39;re always like this. They get along well. I noticed Cedric making frequent early morning visits upstairs, saying he was bringing Daniela water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the maid&#39;s explanation, Katrina was incredulous. Ddn&#39;t Daniela have water in her room? Was it something special about the water provided by Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she pondered this, Daniela descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly asked, &#34;Where&#39;s Cedric? Still in your room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face remained impassive, though her lips were slightly reddened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s organizing some company data,&#34; she responded nonchalantly as she walked towards the sofa and turned on the TV. &#34;What did you want to discuss with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela focused on the TV, Katrina, feeling a bit dissatisfied, decided not to press further. Instead, she ventured, &#34;Could you do me a favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, picking up an apple, responded flatly,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t even told you what it is yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayedsilent, her attention fixed on the TV, her demeanor detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric descended the stairs and saw Daniela&#39;s aloof expression, the peace he had just reclaimed was unsettled again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;s nothing serious,&#34; Katrina mentioned, trying to remain nonchalant despite her internal turmoil over Joyce&#39;s recent actions. &#34;Could you transfer Joyce&#39;s dividends to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned and asked,&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to reveal her true motives, Katrina said, &#34;I&#39;m a bit strapped for cash lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Ask Joyce to transfer them to you. I don&#39;t handle those details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clenched her teeth in frustration. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll tell you the truth-Joyce and Alexander are divorcing.I don&#39;t want the Bennett family to get any dividends from the robotics company. I&#39;d appreciate if you could halt the dividend distribution until I get things sorted.&#34; Unbeknownst to Katrina, Daniela had already ordered the halt on dividends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Katrina willing to take the blame, Daniela was content to let her do so. &#34;What should I say if Joyce asks?&#34; she asked.</p>
