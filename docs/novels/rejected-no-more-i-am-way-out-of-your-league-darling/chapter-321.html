                <p>Alexander&#39;s sincere confession was heartfelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to them, someone recorded the entire exchange on camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela was bathed in the morning sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never fully grasped the concept of love. She thought she liked Cedric, but couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly what it was about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as she gazed at Alexander now, her understanding suddenly clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a smile, yet her eyes remained cold as she met Alexander&#39;s look. &#34;I can&#39;t believe how blind I was before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s confident expression wavered for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, we&#39;re fundamentally different. You&#39;re fixated on power and wealth. To you, they are more important than any personal connection. When Katrina brought me to the rooftop, you were fully aware of what was unfolding. Yet, you were too frightened to intervene. You maintained your distance, feigning concern for me. You said all the right things but never left your comfort zone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her accusation, Alexander&#39;s sense of alarm intensified, and he started to desperately defend himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela stopped him with a raised hand, her tone steady. &#34;I know what you&#39;re going to say, but I don&#39;t base my judgments on words alone. Actions are what count. Alexander, I don&#39;t wish to dwell on the past,and to be honest, I see no role for you in my future.Can we agree on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sought someone who would be unwaveringly loyal, ready to face any ordeal alóngside her, not a slick deceiver who offered comforting words without genuine intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s hopes crumbled instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood immobilized, his facade dismantled, his instinct was to refute everything. But how could he possibly deny it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, he struggled to maintain his poise, yet he remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had seen straight through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw his selfishness and his smooth, misleading words. He was like a man laid bare, his flaws completely exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was utterly humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander looked away, Daniela was already striding towards the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps were decisive, never faltering or glancing back. Each step she took seemed to slice through his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage of Alexander&#39;s heartfelt confession to Daniela quickly spread across the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had just returned from a business trip and was en route to the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary, who was sitting next to him, broached the subject of the trending video. &#34;Mr. Phillips, there&#39;s a lot of talk online. Don&#39;t you want to see what it&#39;s about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a simple comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was aware that Cedric usually maintained a strong sense of self-assurance and typically disregarded online gossip or comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s public relations team was essentially just for show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When those words echoed in the car, the secretay was momentarily stunned, and the driver was just as surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still in a state of shock, the secretary handed over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, bathed in the morning light and impeccably dressed, tilted his head with a dignified air as he began scrolling through his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Alexander trying to rekindle an old love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show some self-respect.Should this even be trending? It&#39;s disgusting for both Daniela and us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! I&#39;ve always said Cedric is the genuine article! I heard he and Daniela were old schoolmates.Maybe he knows something about their history!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l agree! They&#39;re always so low-key. There&#39;s barely any information about them. But whenever they&#39;re seen together, they seem like the perfect couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check this out, I was in their class! If you&#39;re curious about the details, just check my profile. P&#39;ll spill all the secrets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes remained fixed on the last comment for an extended period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary observed Cedric and noted a gentle smile breaking across his usually stoic face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became apparent to the secretary that Cedric had started following a specific account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car had been stationary outside the Phillips Group building for some time now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric showed no signs of leaving the car while his employees gathered outside, wondering about their boss&#39;s unusual behavior today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every decision made by their boss, a man who dealt with millions every minute, was crucial for the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, all eyes were glued to the car door, anticipating its opening. Yet, it stayed shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips? We&#39;ve arrived at the company.&#34; After spending thirty minutes exchanging looks with the driver,the secretary finally broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, still engrossed in his phone, casually acknowledged with an&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then passed the phone back to the secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching the elevator, Cedric instructed, &#34;Send me that account&#39;s details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary responded, &#34;Okay, sir.&#34; While the reply was calm, curiosity stifl showed on the secretary&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they neared the CEO&#39;s office in the elevator, the secretary, feeling a flush of curiosity, quietly asked, &#34;Mr.Phillips, is what was posted on that account accurate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary had only glimpsed at the account briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very account had shared many insider details, each garnering tens of thousands of shares. In just thirty minutes, comments had soared past a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR department, which had been inactive for some time, was on standby, ready to spring into action.They awaited Cedric&#39;s command to quash the rumors with decisive action and show that Phillips Group&#39;s PR was more than just a show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary viewed the PR director&#39;s message inquiring about the online rumors and asked Cedric,&#34;D we need to address the online rumors?&#34;</p>
