                <p>Caiden and Joyce instinctively turned to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could react, Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the room. &#34;Caiden, you&#39;re the first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated,his lips pressing together.&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get out of the psychiatric hospital.If you skip anything or lie, I&#39;ll have you sent straight back.&#34;Daniela&#39;s gaze was icy, void of emotion. &#34;Since you escaped, they&#39;ve reinforced the place with layers of security. If you end up back there, not even wings could get you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face went pale. &#34;Daniela,I&#39;m your father! You can&#39;t do this to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back, fingers drumming lightly on the table, her presence alone weighing on the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden swallowed hard. &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t know what happened. It was a rainy night when my door suddenly creaked open. A voice in the dark asked if I was your father. The moment I said yes, they stuck a needle in my neck. Next thing I knew, I blacked out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rubbed his neck. &#34;Right here. When I came to, I was in this villa. At first, I freaked out, but I had nowhere else to go. So I stayed. Nothing weird happened after that, so I just settled in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her gaze, listening to the steady downpour outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha quietly shut the floor-to-ceiling window. The heavy rain hammered against the glass, filling the room with a steady rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela finally spoke. &#34;Did the person who helped you have any noticeable features?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden thought hard, his brows furrowing. He shook his head. &#34;No, but I remember a weird smell. Kind of like hospital disinfectant, but different. If I smelled it again,I&#39;d know right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden pointed to the base of his thumb. &#34;Oh! He had a burn mark. Right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond right away, and Caliden&#39;s inerves spiked. &#34;That&#39;s everything, Daniela. You have tho keep your word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Why do you think they helped you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden spread his hands. &#34;No clue. llt&#39;s beem bugging ime ever sinoe. They just wanished after geting ime (out.&#34; Daniela gave a slight nod. She then shifted her gaze to Joyce. &#34;And you? How did you get out of Alexander&#39;s basement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes widened the moment she heard the question. &#34;How do you know?&#34; She had never told a soul about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t about to reveal that she led the intelligence department. She knew Olisvine like the back of her hand-Alexander&#39;s basement included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask, you answer. That&#39;s how this works. I don&#39;t owe you any explanations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pouted. &#34;Fine. Alexander locked me up in the basement. I was just about to escape on my own when someone unlocked the door, so I slipped out. Then l saw the explosion on TV. I had nowhere else to go, so I came back to the villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at her. &#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; She didn&#39;t look impressed. Joyce&#39;s story wasn&#39;t much help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce quickly added, &#34;Wait, there&#39;s more! Before you came back,I got a note. It said you were returning and told me not to let you go. It even said thatif you died,your fortune would be mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held out her hand. &#34;Where&#39;s the note?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hesitated. She considered using it as leverage. &#34;I&#39;ll give it to you, but can you give me some money as a reward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot Daniela a wary glance, suddenly feeling uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her down instantly. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gawked at her. &#34;If you&#39;re asking for a favor,the least you can do is be polite! Do you even want the note? It might be linked to whoever planned the explosion-your enemy, for all you know! This could be a major clue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden frowned, suddenly regretting not asking for something too. He should&#39;ve bargained while he had the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could dwell on it, Daniela&#39;s icy voice cut through the room. &#34;Joyce,do you really think l can&#39;t send you right back? That basement&#39;s been empty for a while now. Want to take another trip down there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot up from her seat in an instant. Without a word,she bolted for her room.</p>
