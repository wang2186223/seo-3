                <p>At that moment, Daniela&#39;s name became the buzz throughout Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary watched in astonishment as Daniela&#39;s name dominated the trending lists and murmured to Hamilton, &#34;Daniela has become a sensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched numbly as the crowd erupted in cheers, observing Daniela gracefully dismount her horse and give it an appreciative pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she turned to address the gathering of cameras, her smile slowly unfolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her beauty was striking, capturing the attention of all who saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Daniela&#39;s gaze met Hamilton&#39;s, her eyes conveying the force of her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting a smile, Hamilton adjusted his expression before addressing the reporter. &#34;Earlier, youinquired about when I would officially announce Cedric&#39;s identity to the public, correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter nodded, unsure of why Hamilton was revisiting the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Hamilton&#39;s next words were unexpected and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;I believe it won&#39;t be long before Cedric is introduced to all as my eldest son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter was taken aback, hesitating before asking, &#34;May I report this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a reassuring smile, Hamilton answered, &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On that day, the McCoy family officially recognized Cedric&#39;s place within their ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, Nikolas jumped down from his horse, his face contorted with fury. Confronting Daniela, he asked,&#34;How did you cheat in the race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never one to suffer sore losers gladly, Daniela retorted with a scornful laugh, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t you accept that you were beaten?&#34; Completely bewildered, Nikolas said, &#34;This makes no sense! That horse has thrown off every trainer it&#39;s encountered. It&#39;s simply untamable. How on earth did you win its compliance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his shock, Nikolas lost all sense of decorum before the cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face twisted in rage, it seemed as though he might physically attack Daniela at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusatory and loud, he exclaimed, &#34;You definitely cheated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the competition had concluded, the gathered cameras were capturing every moment of their exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live broadcast was picking up every word of Nikolas&#39; tirade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Hamilton scowled and whispered urgently to his secretary, &#34;Such a disgrace! Quickly, go stop him making a fool of himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary scurried to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter quietly commented to a colleague,&#34;Isn&#39;t Nikolas too quick to anger? Does he really have the temperament to lead the McCoy family in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, overhearing this, twisted the ring on his fingermore forcefully, his expression growing darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Nikolas shouted in desperation, pointing at her. &#34;Tell me, you used foul play! I can&#39;t lose like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This competition was his stronghold, his area of pride, where he was supposed to have the upper hand against Daniela. How could he face such a defeat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had deliberately excluded his brothers from the competition to spotlight his own skills in front of his father and the entire family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had envisioned this event as his moment to prove his dominance over Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he ended up being the butt of jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was he supposed to accept this humiliation? At the brink of attacking, Nikolas was barely held back as Hamilton&#39;s secretary, Joseph Quinn, quickly intervened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a keen awareness of the media&#39;s eyes on them, Joseph said in a hushed tone, &#34;Please consider your reputation. Your father wants to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nikolas refused to budge. He gestured towards the horse next to Daniela. &#34;There&#39;s something off about the horse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph exhaled deeply, lowering his voice further. &#34;It doesn&#39;t change the outcome. You&#39;ve lost publicly.Continuing this spectacle will only tarnish the McCoy family&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; anger began to subside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph then looked towards Daniela, offering a warm smile. &#34;Ms. Harper, congratulations on your victory.Mr.McCoy witnessed it himself. You must be tired and hungry. Please, join us inside for a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joseph attempted to pull Nikolas away, Daniela casually grabbed a microphone and called out to Nikolas,&#34;Hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried far through the speaker, making Joseph freeze in his tracks with Nikolas by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bristling with rage, Nikolas fixed a hostile gaze on her. &#34;What else could you possibly want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the microphone confidently, Daniela replied with an unruffled smile, &#34;It appears you&#39;ve overlooked something crucial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, the color drained from both Nikolas&#39; and Joseph&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area was bustling with onlookers, journalists, and individuals broadcasting the event live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present, including Nikolas and Joseph, knew exactly what Daniela was about to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension, Joseph approached Daniela and suggested cautiously,&#34;Ms. Harper, might we consider letting this go? If you force him to mimic a dog here, how will he ever show his face again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes briefly met Nikolas&#39;. But before she could respond, Nikolas interjected, &#34;There&#39;s no way you won fair and square, Daniela! You&#39;re utterly without honor. Your victory is meaningless! I will never concede!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph shut his eyes momentarily, lamenting silently in a way Hamilton often did, muttering, &#34;What a fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, arching an eyebrow at Joseph, questioned, &#34;So, you can&#39;t stomach a defeat? Trying to back out of our bet now, are we? Alright then.&#34; With that, she took out her phone, activated the recording function, and aimed it towards the microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph extended his hand in a bid to halt her actions. Yet, his efforts were in vain as it was already beyond stopping.</p>
