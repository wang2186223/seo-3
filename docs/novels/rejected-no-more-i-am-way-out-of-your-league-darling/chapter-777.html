                <p>Daniela wasted no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had bought the villa right across from McCoy Group&#39;s headquarters, and the decorating began not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to interiors, Cedric knew his stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led his team with sharp commands and clear purpose.Pride showed in every step. The last time,he had to fight just to get the job. But this time, there was no contest. Daniela handed it to him without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other building, Hamilton stood watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That place looks like it&#39;s falling apart. What do they even hope to get out of it? Even if they go all out,how could they match McCoy Group&#39;s standard? We brought in the best designers in the world to build this place.That building over there won&#39;t even come close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary glanced his way, unsure whether he was hoping Cedric would fail or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Hamilton didn&#39;t sound particularly bitter. Meanwhile, the McCoy brothers had gathered to look as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a dry laugh. &#34;How great can it really be?He might have talent, but he&#39;s still a cripple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen added, &#34;That&#39;s right. A project that big? He doesn&#39;t even have a full team. Is he planning to do it all by himself? Come on, he&#39;s bluffing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded. &#34;Yeah, probably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon turned to him. &#34;Didn&#39;t you used to back Daniela? What happened? She stopped helping you out,and now you&#39;ve switched sides?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>9Charles didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon let out a low snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas turned to the secretary. &#34;Find some locals.Get them to complain about the noise and mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t trying to stop the work. He wanted to stall it long enough that it would never finish. His goal was clear-make Cedric and Daniela a joke in Osland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary started to say yes, but Damon stepped in. &#34;Is this really necessary? We&#39;re already the richest family in the world. No matter how far Daniela goes,she can&#39;t overtake us. So what&#39;s the point?&#34; Nikolas shot him a cold stare. &#34;You ask why? Because if we don&#39;t take Cedric out now, we won&#39;t get another chance. Once he rises, there&#39;ll be no stopping him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon looked back, troubled. &#34;So you&#39;d rather destroy your brother than risk losing a bit of control?Nikolas, does blood mean nothing to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scowled hard. &#34;Are you out of your mind,Damon? Who exactly are you defending right now? So what if Daniela is Shim? Has she gotten into your head so badly that you&#39;re turning against us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon tried to reason with him. &#34;I&#39;m just saying-we don&#39;t need to go that far. She&#39;s not trying to take anything from us. They&#39;re independent. They don&#39;t even rely on our name. Why provoke them unnecessarily? Besides,Daniela&#39;s not easy to deal with.We&#39;ve lost face more than once already. If we push this any further, Father won&#39;t be pleased.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as Damon mentioned Hamilton, Nikolas nearly lost it. His jaw clenched. His voice sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re trying to use Father against me now? Is that it?Does my opinion count for nothing in this family?I make one decision, and suddenly all of you have something to say? Let me make this clear-Osland belongs to the McCoys. It always has, and it always will!&#34; With that, Nikolas shoved past the others and stormed off in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric was going over the updated designs when a group of irritated locals gathered at the site entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to set down his pen when he caught sight of Daniela approaching the crowd with cash in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time at all, those frowns turned into cheerful grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said gently, &#34;I&#39;m terribly sorry, everyone.We should&#39;ve come by earlier to greet you properly, but the schedule&#39;s been packed. I know our renovation work can be noisy, but I give you my word-we&#39;ll stick to Osland&#39;s rules for work hours. I&#39;ve brought a small compensation. It&#39;s fifty thousand per household. I hope it helps ease the inconvenience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd,which had been fuming moments ago,now beamed with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifty thousand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was several months&#39; salaries for most of their families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older woman clutched the money and chuckled.&#34;Young folks these days really know how to handle things. Just tell me-how long&#39;s the renovation going to take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll issue a payment every month while the project continues. And if the final month is cut short, we&#39;ll still pay for the full month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did the trick. The mood shifted completely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People began to speak up all at once. &#34;Take your time with the work. It&#39;s a major project, and big investments take careful planning. Make it beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! We support you!&#34;</p>
