                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t give anyone a chance to explain or defend themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply turned and made his way upstairs,his pace easy,like none of it had mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood frozen at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she snapped out of it, she gave a short nod. &#34;I&#39;m fine with how Cedric handled the matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she sent a message to the group chat. &#34;You guys don&#39;t need to come here. Alexander is paralyzed now. Let Cedric take care of Hamilton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon felt like the world had tipped off its axis. He couldn&#39;t find the words. Eventually,he turned to Carol and said, &#34;But that&#39;s still our father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression didn&#39;t change. Gone was the usual calm.&#34;He&#39;s not Daniela&#39;s father. Anyone who dares to hurt her has to pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she walked off and closed her door. Silence pressed down on the room like a heavy curtain.Not a sound. Not even a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon and Nikolas stood there, looking pale and hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon ran a hand through his hair and grabbed his coat off the couch. &#34;What the hell just happened?Why did Dad have to mess with Daniela? Nikolas,come on. Let&#39;s go back. Dad needs to come and apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced upstairs. His voice was low. &#34;You think he&#39;ll come? Even if he does, will they forgive him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride back was quiet. Neither of them spoke for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their thoughts kept circling around the image of Daniela-blood pooling around her, her eyes red with vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never seen Daniela like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was always composed, with an air of indifference. She always wore a faint smile, tough on the outside but soft-hearted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t supposed to look like that-broken and exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Cedric had snapped. After seeing her like that,they felt the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up in front of the McCoy family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t wait. He threw open the door and ran inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon followed, close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house exploded into chaos. It was the loudest argument they&#39;d ever lived through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had wanted to keep his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had planned to talk about what Daniela had endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted his father to know the kind of person she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also needed to speak about how much pain the incident had caused her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he opened the door, the sound of music filled the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one of those slow, old classics Hamilton always played when he was in a good mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; jaw tightened. He stepped further inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat on the couch, one leg crossed, a wine glass in hand. He was smiling, relaxed, humming to the tune as the rain tapped against the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard the door creak and turned his head toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the way he looked, it was clear-he had no intention of letting anyone ruin his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back so soon? Did you catch the news? I wonder who managed to capture Daniela&#39;s broken state. Quite the talent, don&#39;t you think? She had her eyes shut so tight.Brow all scrunched up. That image alone gives me a thrill just thinking about it. Alexander really outdid himself. I didn&#39;t think Daniela was that afraid of heights. Guess her mother&#39;s death left a bigger mark than I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton laughed recklessly, tilting his head back to drink the wine in his glass. &#34;It&#39;s absolutely thrilling!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked at them both standing in the doorway &#34;So? After they left, what happened? Did they lose it?Was she shaking like a leaf? Don&#39;t start with me. I&#39;ve said it before-it never ends well. Women should stick to family. That&#39;s their place. Not running around,pretending they belong in the world outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Rage shot through him. &#34;Do you seriously feel nothing? No guilt at all?&#34;</p>
