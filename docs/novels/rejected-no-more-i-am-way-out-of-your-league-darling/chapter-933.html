                <p>Damon stared at Hamilton, utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had he witnessed Hamilton act so mercilessly toward anyone from the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, the soon-to-arrive grandchild meant everything to Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, inside the McCoy Group&#39;s conference room, Hamilton&#39;s siblings had gathered for a tense meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh slammed his palm down on the armrest and blurted out, &#34;I can hardly believe it. Daniela is actually pregnant! She really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad added asked, &#34;Did you notice anything?Daniela&#39;s pregnancy just seems different from what we&#39;ve seen with our daughters-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s wife sneered, &#34;What&#39;s so different? Daniela barely moved from her chair the entire time. What could you possibly know from that? I&#39;m convinced she&#39;s carrying a girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, &#34;I think you&#39;re right. Don&#39;t people say women who have boys start craving sour things?We watched Daniela for a while and she never touched anything sour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased Josh&#39;s face, his mood turning grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when he heard the family&#39;s jealous remarks, he let a smirk slip and quickly regained his calm. &#34;Is that so? If you&#39;re all convinced Daniela is having a girl,there&#39;s no reason to worry. Let&#39;s just wait until the baby arrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room immediately went on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad responded, &#34;Hold on, Josh. You can&#39;t be so sure. Maybe it looks like she&#39;ll have a girl, but what if it&#39;s a boy? Then McCoy Group will have nothing to do with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules quickly added, &#34;That&#39;s right. Honestly, this child should never have existed in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan remarked, &#34;Honestly, things would be simpler if this child didn&#39;t make it. Just like what happened to Daniela&#39;s first child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Ethan finished, a heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh glanced around at the others, a mocking smile curling on his lips. &#34;Exactly. It would be best if this child never saw the light of day, just like last time.But who&#39;s going to make that happen? Who was behind the disappearance of the last child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one answered. The room fell silent again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh got to his feet and continued, &#34;My branch is finished anyway. Mason won&#39;t have any more children, so my chances are gone. But things are different for the rest of you. If Daniela gives birth to a boy first, you won&#39;t have a chance again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made everyone in the room scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp edge to his voice, Josh added, &#34;If you&#39;re going to do something, do it soon, before it&#39;s too late. If the gender is revealed, and it&#39;s a boy,Hamilton will make sure that child is protected and you won&#39;t be able to interfere. It&#39;s always better to act early. I&#39;ve said all I need to say; it&#39;s none of my concern anymore. You guys figure it out. I&#39;m heading to the hospital to check on MMason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused in the doorway, tossing out one last remark. &#34;By the way, McCoy Group&#39;s stock took another hit this morning. If this keeps up, you won&#39;t need to wait for the baby-the company will go bankrupt before then. If you want to stop that, you&#39;d better put someone in charge soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh looked back at the group, and when no one replied, he let out a snort and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator, his secretary eyed him with confusion. &#34;Mr. McCoy, are you really giving up McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sneered, &#34;Of course not. They&#39;re far more desperate than I am, obsessed with Daniela&#39;s pregnancy. They&#39;re not even paying attention to McCoy Group. Before long, they&#39;ll be the ones begging me to take over, because they trust me and think Mason&#39;s condition makes me harmless. What they don&#39;t realize is that assets can be transferred behind the scenes. While they focus on Daniela&#39;s child, I&#39;ll quietly take over the entire fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;Now that Mason can&#39;t have more children, there&#39;s no point clinging to McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;But what if they find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh dismissed the concern with a scoff. &#34;Daniela and Cedric are busy keeping their baby safe, and the whole family is dlistracted. I only need three months.While they&#39;re tangled upin all this chaos, I&#39;ll make my move and take over everything.&#34;</p>
