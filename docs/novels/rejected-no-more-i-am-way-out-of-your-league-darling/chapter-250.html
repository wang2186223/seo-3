                <p>Katrina was determined to defend Joyce, but she knew better than to confront Alexander on her own.Venturing into the Bennett family&#39;s territory uninvited was a recipe for disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you accompany me to the Bennett family&#39;s, Caiden?&#34; Katrina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s attention remained glued to the television in the living room, his response laced with derision.&#34;Me? Why on earth would I? Who am I to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes widened, her voice tinged with incredulity. &#34;How can you even ask that? You&#39;re Joyce&#39;s father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I, though?&#34; Caiden retorted. &#34;When you need me, I&#39;m Joyce&#39;s father, but when everything&#39;s fine,I&#39;m nobody. No, I can&#39;t play this part-time father role any longer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,her frustration mounting, stepped closer. &#34;What are you saying, Caiden? How can you call yourself nobody?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Cedric, sensing the tension rising, instinctively drew Daniela closer to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, previously absorbed in the unfolding scene, felt Cedric&#39;s pull and complied without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan munched on popcorn, seemingly uninterested in Katrina&#39;s drama yet intrigued by the interaction between Cedric and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina continued to plead her case, but Caiden&#39;s patience had frayed to its end.&#34;Oh, really? Have you forgotten your own words? You were the one who told me to turn to Daniela in times of crisis, that she was my true daughter, and not to drag Joyce into anything. Remember how Joyce didñ&#39;t even visit me in the hospital? Does that seem like a daughter&#39;s duty? Ha! I&#39;m not blessed with such a daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Katrina stuttered, lost for words, overwhelmed by the ghosts of past arguments. She had thought that once Joyce was married, she could sever her reliance on Caiden, never anticipating a day like this. If only she had known, she would have fostered a stronger bond with him. &#34;Joyce is just a child. Why hold a  grudge against her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Is Joyce a child? How old is she now, still playing the child? She&#39;s a married woman with a child of her own, yet still immature? Perhaps what she really needs is a lesson in maturity. And weren&#39;t you being so arrogant a few days ago? If I hadn&#39;t kept my cool, I&#39;d have died of rage by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began to stream down Katrina&#39;s cheeks. &#34;What are you implying? Are you leaving us now? I&#39;m still your wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rose from his seat, his face a mask of indifference. &#34;Whatever the case, I refuse to wade into Joyce&#39;s quagmire. She&#39;s not my biological daughter. If you wish to remain here, she may too. But if you&#39;re considering divorce, take Joyce with you. There&#39;s no room for either of you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face crumpled with despair at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she hadn&#39;t expected Caiden to say such things, or she hadn&#39;t expected to be at a disadvantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned over and whispered to Daniela, &#34;When did Caiden get so clear-headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s really none of my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela spoke, Katrina approached, her lips quivering, tears streaking her face. Cedric stood,blocking her path. &#34;These people have nothing to do with you. Move along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always intimidated by Cedric, Katrina bit her lip, realizing she held no sway over anyone in the room except possibly Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeated,she collapsed onto the sofa, wallowing in her misfortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her plight continued to be ignored, she ascended the stairs sulkily, presumably to seek an audience with Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In family disputes like these, Caiden&#39;s support was crucial; otherwise, Alexander could believe he could trample over Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What fate would befall Joyce?     Wíth a heavy heart, Katrina once again tried to softeri Caiden&#39;s stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One afternoon, while Cedric was occupied with a phone call outside, Katrina attempted to engage Daniela once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found it mildly amusing. &#34;Whatever befalls Joyce doesn&#39;t concern me in the slightest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Joyce ís still your stepsister and a stakeholder in your robotics venture. If the news breaks that she&#39;s been beaten by her husband, it could reflect poorly on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela interrupted her smoothly, &#34;Rest assured, it won&#39;t affect me in the slightest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katrina opened her mouth to respond, Cedric reappeared, prompting her hasty retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With dwindling options, Katrina resorted to spending a significant sum to secure a dinner with the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard already harbored disdain for Joyce, and Alexander remained a silent observer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered, Joyce shrank into herself, wvhile Caiden ate his food, leaving Katrina to confront Richard and Alexander alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Alexander&#39;s aunt arrived and began chastising Joyce. &#34;You&#39;ve married into the Bennett family; you&#39;re one of us now. Running back to your parents over a trifling dispute? Childish, completely.childish! MMen need to let off steam after all the work; a little scuffle is nothing to fuss over. You&#39;ve riled up your husband, and that&#39;s on you. If you can bear it, stay. Otherwise, the Bennett famnily does not need your presence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, dumbstruck, hadn&#39;t uttered a single word before being fiercely reprimanded.</p>
