                <p>Hackett was utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw dropped, and he found himself unable to snap it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought he was staring at Cedric himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to his feet, Hackett began to circle Alexander,examining him closely from every possible angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail, from the hairstyle and clothes to the facial expressions and mannerisms, mirrored Cedric perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this really you, Alexander?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver of realization crept down Hackett&#39;s spine at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explained why Winslow had always remarked on the familiarity of Alexander&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, paying closer attention, Hackett confirmed that Alexander&#39;s voice was indeed identical to Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. &#34;If you remain this shocked, you&#39;ll run out of time to deal with your company&#39;s emergency!&#34; Alexander reminded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett took a deep breath. Looking intently at Alexander, he asked, &#34;Where did you have the surgery done? You must tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett went to pick up his three daughters, so that they could have a video shoot with Alexander at his hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the drive,Hackett buzzed with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If altering one&#39;s appearance was indeed so straightforward,why not replicate Cedric&#39;s by the dozen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why stop at Cedric? He could replicate Daniela too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling as though he had stumbled upon a fantastical opportunity, Hackett promptly called an overseas plastic surgeon he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he mentioned it concerned Alexander, the response was immediate. &#34;Hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly thereafter, they sent Hackett a pricing list and a video documenting the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett scanned the figures and inhaled sharply. The cost was astronomical-nearly a hundred billion dollars!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then clicked on the video marked &#34;Top Secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes into the video, Hackett was so shocked that he smacked the driver on the back and yelled, &#34;Stop the car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the car came to a halt,Hackett bolted outside and threw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary hurried after him, confused. &#34;Mr. Graves,what happened? Was there something in the surgery video that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett vomited again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett bent over, retching up his recent meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visions of the harrowing surgery footage overwhelmed his mind. The procedure involved brutally reshaping bones and reassembling them, an agonizingly painful process. The plastic surgeon&#39;s voice message then played. &#34;If you haven&#39;t braced yourself for the potential of death,I advise against proceeding lightly. This surgery might completely alter someone&#39;s appearance, but it carries a mortality rate of ninety-nine percent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After regaining some composure, Hackett rinsed his mouth and spat out the water. &#34;Alexander has completely lost his mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary asked cautiously, &#34;Mr. Graves, are you still considering transitioning the association leadership to Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett narrowed his eyes. &#34;Yes. He&#39;s set on getting rid of Cedric anyway. In the end, the world has room for only one Cedric, and Daniela will love only that one. Alexander is more desperate than us. The enemy of my enemy is my ally. Once Alexander steps into Cedric&#39;s shoes for Daniela, the doors to numerous collaborative ventures will open. Imagine the advantages we&#39;ll hold over him then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most pressing matter was to navigate through the current turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hackett had left, Richard entered Alexander&#39;s study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after all this time, Richard couldn&#39;t help but be amazed when he saw Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, weren&#39;t you bothered by the association&#39;s demands? What&#39;s changed your mind now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm seemed to brew in Alexander&#39;s eyes as he explained, &#34;Daniela&#39;s standing is unattainable. If wealth doesn&#39;t bring me to her level, then I&#39;ll climb the social ladder. My interest isn&#39;t in the association itself, but l won&#39;t overlook any opportunity that might bring me closer to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he cleared the association of current members,his next move would be to bring Daniela into the association. By then, he would rule the association,with Daniela as his most devoted ally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him,the setup was ideal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Alexander accompanied Hackett&#39;s three daughters into the hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the scrutinizing gaze of the high-definition camera, Alexander wore Cedric&#39;s face. He tried to maintain composure but evidently relished the role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the camera, Hackett watched, utterly astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander truly was a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruthless and determined, he wouldn&#39;t stop until Cedric was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His actions would drive Cedric into an inescapable corner of public scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric had just navigated through a corporate crisis. Fresh from a shower and dressed in comfortable pajamas, he reclined on the bed, anticipating Daniela&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric greeted her with a suggestive grin as she entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love.&#34; Cedric leaped across the room and wrapped her in a tight embrace. &#34;When will you make me a father? I yearn for a child with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was a gentle laugh. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face brightened at her words, pulling her in for a deep kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela expressed a desire to shower, and Cedric insisted on joining her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly agreeing, Daniela was about to embrace him whenthe ringing of a phone interrupted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced towards the sound, breathless. &#34;Your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric whispered seductively, &#34;Let it ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Daniela&#39;s phone began to ring as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached for it, Cedric drew her back to the bed. &#34;Let yours ring too,&#34; he murmured, his kisses trailing her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela struggled to catch her breath under his affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a knock at the door interrupted them.&#34;Daniela,&#34; called Lillian&#39;s voice from outside.</p>
