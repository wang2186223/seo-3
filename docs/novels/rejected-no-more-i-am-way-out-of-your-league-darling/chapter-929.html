                <p>A tissue in hand, Daniela carefully wiped her fingers clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out into the hallway and told the maid,&#34;Go ahead and get dinner started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the maid dismissed, she finally faced the swarm of McCoy family members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was wedged near the back of the group,while his secretary stood to the side, covering his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Josh&#39;s voice thundered with rage as soon as he laid eyes on her. The urge to lash out at her was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unfazed, Daniela kept wiping her hands with the tissue until she was satisfied, then tossed it into the trash. &#34;What were you doing just now?&#34; Josh asked bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even bother to meet his eyes as she answered, &#34;This is my home. Whatever I choose to do here is my business. Either leave now, or I&#39;ll call the police and have you all removed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Daniela stand her ground made Hamilton lift his chin and straighten up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh could barely contain his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s wife stepped forward and chimed in, &#34;She just came out of the bathroom. I&#39;ll bet she already checked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Josh turned to the others. &#34;Go search the bathroom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood back and watched while a couple of McCoy women charged into her bathroom, tearing through the trash can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only stare in disbelief. &#34;Is this what things have come to? Have you lost your minds after your stock price took a nosedive?&#34; Josh gave Daniela a hard stare. &#34;Enough with the games. Tell me where you&#39;re hiding the pregnancy test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face darkened in an instant. A sharp glare swept over the group crowded in the doorway. &#34;How exactly do you know I bought a pregnancy test?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An icy chill settled in her eyes, carrying a threat that made the air tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The effect was immediate-the McCoy family stepped back in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lingered near the rear, head down, a faint,knowing smirk flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warming even a fraction, Daniela fixed her cold gaze on the retreating group. Then, she called out to those still turning over trash in the bathroom,&#34;You have one second to get out of there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, not ready to back down, retorted, &#34;Aren&#39;t you supposed to count to three?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came from Daniela. She couldn&#39;t even be bothered to look up. Instead, she picked up a fruit knife from the platter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the room as wide eyes darted to the knife in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, Josh blurted out, &#34;Hurry up and get out of here!&#34; Then he turned to Daniela and screamed, &#34;You&#39;ve completely lost your mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flurry of footsteps followed as the women rushed out of the bathroom, scattering in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting a moment, Josh asked, &#34;Did anyone find it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shook their heads, empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to let up, Josh pointed at Daniela. &#34;Stop playing games. Just hand over the test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a cold tone, Daniela said, &#34;Leave. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, a satisfied look crossed Josh&#39;s face. Turning to the others, he grinned. &#34;If she were actually pregnant, she wouldn&#39;t act like this. Clearly, there&#39;s nothing to find.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Josh flashed a smug look at Hamilton,clearly enjoying his supposed victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad let out a sigh of relief, breaking into laughter.&#34;See? I told you. Someone like Daniela could never have a child. There&#39;s no way she&#39;s pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules bounced his legs with satisfaction. &#34;Exactly!It&#39;s better this way. I said from the start. Daniela just doesn&#39;t seem like the type to carry a boy. That honor should go to my branch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His remark instantly stirred grumbling from the rest of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela folded her arms and watched the whole group coldly, finding their foolishness almost amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton bit his lip and scratched the back of his head, already regretting his earlier overconfidence and scheming how to patch things up with the princess. He knew he&#39;d acted far too hastily. By now, his words were coming back to haunt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, he still pinned the blamne on Daniela. How could she possibly not know if she was pregnant?Why bother with a pregnancy test if there was no reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to the driver by the entrance.&#34;Take that whole truck of supplements back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he fished out his phone,already typing out a message to the princess, hoping to salvage the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness, the whole pregnancy thing was a misunderstanding. So, about your marriage with Cedric, there&#39;s still room to talk. If you&#39;re interested,let&#39;s arrange a meeting. Here&#39;s the address...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the sound of slippers shuffling across the floor drifted from upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared on the staircase, holding a small item and squinting at it. &#34;Sweetheart, what is this test supposed to show? Why are there two lines?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was the first to snap out of it, grabbing Hamilton&#39;s sleeve with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, Hamilton remarked, &#34;Quit bothering me. I&#39;m trying to type, and I can&#39;t see a thing without my glasses. If I mess this up, it&#39;s on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush, the secretary exclaimed, &#34;Mr. McCoy, two lines! There are two lines!&#34;</p>
