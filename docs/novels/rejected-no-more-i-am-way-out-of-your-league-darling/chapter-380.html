                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze on Daniela was intense, almost obsessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed confirmation, an answer that would prove everything that had transpired wasn&#39;t just a product of his imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled upon hearing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile, bathed in moonlight, was so captivating that it left Alexander breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, completely stunned, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I truly envy your confidence,&#34; Daniela remarked,before opening the car door and driving off,Alexander stood there, bathed in moonlight, as the car disappeared into the distance. He stood motionless for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment was captured by a reporter and quickly shared online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One netizen commented, &#34;Why is Daniela with Alexander?&#34; Another questioned, &#34;Why didn&#39;t Daniela attend the banquet with Cedric tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third comment read, &#34;There&#39;s something strangely sweet about Daniela and Alexander standing together under the moonlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fourth user added, &#34;Are they getting back together?Oh my! The drama in their circle is a real show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flood of comments from netizens followed the post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie forwarded the comments to Cedric, asking, &#34;Is it possible that Daniela wants to reconcile with Alexander? When are you returning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, offering no response this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning home, Daniela found Nina sitting on the sofa in the living room, watching TV, smiling innocently, the image of sweetness. As soon as she saw Daniela, Nina greeted her cheerfully, &#34;Hey,Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked down, typing a message to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing by Nina, Daniela&#39;s eyes were drawn to the slippers on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina glanced down at her slippers, then back up at Daniela, asking, &#34;What&#39;s wrong,Daniela?&#34; Daniela quickly averted her gaze, replying, &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed upstairs and sent a message to the driver,requesting a pair of men&#39;s slippers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her shower, Daniela checked her phone again,but Cedric had still not responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured he was just busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went downstairs, retrieved the slippers, and placed them neatly on the shoe rack by the door. Nina stood with her hands behind her back, a smile on her face,and asked, &#34;Did I wear the wrong shoes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela straightened up after neatly placing the slippers and said, &#34;Cedric also stays here. He&#39;s a bit of a neat freak. You wore his slippers by mistake, so 1bought a new pair. Just be careful not to mix them up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was truly surprised by her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Daniela wouldn&#39;t care about such small details. When she moved in, Josie had warned her not to mix up the slippers, but she had intentionally worn Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie hadn&#39;t noticed, but Daniela had spotted it right away when she entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even arranged for new slippers. Even though Cedric was on a business trip abroad and wouldn&#39;t be back for a while, Daniela still made sure to prepare slippers for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could anyone truly believe that Daniela felt nothing for Cedric and that their connection was merely physical?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina couldn&#39;t believe that for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unfazed by Nina&#39;s scrutiny; she was always direct and unapologetically honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,what exactly is your relationship with Cedric?&#34;Nina asked suddenly, just as Daniela was about to head upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood by the entrance, the sensor light gradually dimming until she was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Persistent and calculating, Nina kept her tone light,though her question was blunt. &#34;I&#39;ve heard rumors that Cedric is pursuing you. Now that I&#39;m here, I see he lives in here too. Does that mean there&#39;s more between you two than just him pursuing you? Are you in a relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina watched Daniela&#39;s figure, her eyes never leaving her. Her phone screen lit up faintly, showing Elyse&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she called Elyse, she discreetly hit the record button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, is it so hard to answer? What exactly is your relationship with Cedric?&#34; Nina pushed further.</p>
