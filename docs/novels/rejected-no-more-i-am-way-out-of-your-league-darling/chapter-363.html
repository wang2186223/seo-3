                <p>Daniela flashed a smirk and said, &#34;You claim to have no money, yet Joyce has plenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;Joyce avoids me. She only sends me twenty thousand dollars a month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Replicating Katrina&#39;s earlier tone with a playful smile, Daniela said, &#34;There&#39;s a banquet tonight where Joyce will be present. I&#39;ll bring you along. As her mother, she won&#39;t be able to dismiss you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina realized Daniela was cleverly using her own logic to corner her. Though hesitant, she saw no alternative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instantly read Katrina&#39;s reluctance. &#34;You&#39;ve always been there for Joyce, far more than Caiden ever was for me. It&#39;s only fair that Joyce supports you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina found no fault in that logic and remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian then took a disheartened Katrina to change into the evening attire for the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they prepared to depart, Katrina caught sight of Nina by the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction was immediate: pupils dilating and complexion paling as a shiver ran through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she sidestepped and hurried out of Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, lingering at the door,reflected on her observations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, she had underestimated Daniela, attributing her success to mere luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, witnessing Daniela command a room during meetings changed her perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s dominance and the respect she commanded were undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, as she watched Daniela handle Katrina with such deft authority and strategic conversation, Nina was convinced of Daniela&#39;s complexity. Quietly, Nina bowed her head and texted Elyse:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela will be at the banquet tonight, wrapping up around eleven. I&#39;ll keep Cedric busy, Handle Daniela on your end!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the text, Nina shifted her focus to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian appeared experienced in handling difficult situations. Nina knew she had to find a way to prevent Lillian from attending the banquet, isolating Daniela for the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Nina swung open the door to Daniela&#39;s office, wearing a bright smile and adopting an overly sweet tone. &#34;Daniela, it seems like I&#39;m not on your radar at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Daniela responded with a light chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you attending the banquet tonight? You haven&#39;t considered inviting me to join you for some networking.Are you only taking Lillian? We are family, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we are all part of the Dury family. We should stick together and lift each other up. Please, Daniela, I&#39;d love to go to the banquet with you tonight. Leave Lillian behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was gentle, her voice teasing, &#34;You&#39;re quite demanding, aren&#39;t you? Why can&#39;t Lillian come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina made a face, resembling a sulking child. &#34;I just had a small argument with Lillian. I need some space.Daniela, please, just take me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nod.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s face lit up with delight. She quickly glanced at Cedric, who was preoccupied with his phone, and her heart skipped with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, may I stop by Elite Lux&#39;s high-end designer section to pick a dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave her permission with a nod, &#34;Of course, go pick something nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes sparkled. &#34;Thanks so much, Daniela!&#34; As Nina exited the office, she strutted confidently, assured by her victory</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she believed, Cedric would be completely captivated by her.</p>
