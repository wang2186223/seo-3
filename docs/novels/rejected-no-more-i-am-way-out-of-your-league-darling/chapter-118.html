                <p>Daniela barely stopped herself from gagging at Alexander&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced down the sick feeling rising in her and gave Alexander a sharp, skeptical look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she had been obsessed with him,she could hardly take her eyes off him. But now, with no feelings left, her patience had completely run out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning her head on her hand, she couldn&#39;t help but find the situation amusing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had put in so much effort before, bending over backwards, breaking her own boundaries,just to make Alexander love her. Yet, he wouldn&#39;t even spare her a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, without her lifting a finger, he suddenly wanted to be kind to her, all because he feared she might be interested in Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a complete joke this was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if Alexander thought she was an easy target, which was why he kept coming to belittle her. If that was the case, she saw no reason to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You want to be kind to me?&#34; Daniela replied,continuing to carve the jade in her hand. &#34;Well, go ahead and try. It&#39;s hard to say if I could ever feel anything for you again, but just remember, your choices are yours to make. You&#39;re an adult,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Daniela&#39;s eyes, anyone who asked for a promise before offering something in return was just playing games-and those who played games weren&#39;t worth her time or forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brow furrowed at her words, a frown tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t how he&#39;d pictured it. He had assumed she would agree without hesitation, and they could start building a future together. Instead, she brushed him off as if he meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Daniela raised her eyes to meet his. &#34;You&#39;re not willing? Is it that hard for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then set me a deadline,&#34; Alexander said,his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a laugh. &#34;Do you really need a deadline to be nice to someone? Is being good to others just another task for you? Or a project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s not what I meant...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood up, carefully organizing her carving tools and picking up the finished jade from the table.She looked at Alexander for a moment, her expression neutral. &#34;I&#39;m heading upstairs to rest now. If there&#39;s nothing else you need, then goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked towards the elevator.She stepped inside and left, leaving Alexander standing there, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was usually so quick with his words, but in that moment, he found himself completely at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t sleep a wink after getting home,tossing and turning in bed, restless all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 6 a.m., he was already up and ordered the housekeeper to prepare a variety of breakfasts for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Richard came downstairs and saw what was happening,he couldn&#39;t hide his satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela came downstairs in the morning,Cedric was already sitting in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian walked in and asked Cedric teasingly, &#34;Is the breakfast at your company really that bad? You&#39;re  here every day now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small laugh as she handed Cedric the hand-carved jade she&#39;d made the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had recently acquired a new source of jade and had found some really great pieces, one of which stood out as particularly beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been eager to get a hand-carved jade piece,so Daniela had decided to carve one for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a quick look, not bothered by any imperfections, and happily tucked it into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander arrived with breakfast, Daniela and the others had already finished eating. Lillian was being her usual lively self, laughing loudly at something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the moment she saw Alexander, her laughter abruptly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got closer, Lillian nudged the bag Alexander was carrying. &#34;What&#39;s this? Trying to embarrass yourself by bringing this here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth to reply, but Lillian cut him off. &#34;If this is your way of trying to get back in, it&#39;s a little sad. We just had pancakes made by Cedric.Your breakfast looks like something the housekeeper picked up at the store.&#34; Daniela offered a polite smile before heading towards her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hurried after her. &#34;Daniela, what do you want to eat? I&#39;ll bring it tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian frowned, frustrated at the thought of Daniela&#39;s past feelings going to waste. She shoved Alexander into the elevator, pointing a finger at him.&#34;Are you trying to stir things up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was about to deny it but then paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had known Daniela for years, yet he couldn&#39;t even figure out what she liked to eat. If that wasn&#39;t asking for trouble, he didn&#39;t know what was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the truth was, he had no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, all of Daniela&#39;s efforts over the years had turned into nothing more than a joke.</p>
