                <p>Daniela leaned in close and murmured a few words to Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a crisp nod and slipped out of the office without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh narrowed his eyes, wary of the sly, knowing curve tugging at Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Where did you send your assistant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lounging back on the sofa, Daniela let out a low,unhurried laugh-nothing extravagant, just enough to chill the air between them and make Josh&#39;s skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shivered involuntarily, his bravado faltering.&#34;What&#39;s with that look? Why the hell are you grinning at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other McCoy brothers watched her with open unease,convinced Daniela had finally snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brows furrowed with concern. &#34;Daniela, are you sure you&#39;re all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad tried to smooth things over, his tone placating.&#34;Josh&#39;s words are just a bunch of bullshit. Daniela,don&#39;t let him get under your skin.&#34; Ethan, never one for confrontation, ventured a tentative suggestion. &#34;Maybe we should call it a day before things go any further?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile still curling on her lips, Daniela plucked up an apple and, with unsettling calm, began stripping its skin with Josh&#39;s dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze to pin Josh with a sharp,menacing glare. &#34;I was going to let you off easy, Josh. But since you&#39;re so desperate for an ending, I&#39;ll give you one.We&#39;re done here. Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though every single person in the room agreed this nightmare of a meeting had to end, not a soul dared budge after Daniela&#39;s icy dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what the hell is that supposed to mean?&#34; A ripple of unease swept through Josh; it felt like she was tightening a net around his throat-either she&#39;d bury him today, or she&#39;d go down with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother to respond. Her fingers moved with eerie calm, paring rough strips from the apple,the blade skipping jaggedly over its skin-clearly,she was more practiced at carving flesh than fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, her patience snapped. With a flick of her wrist,she stabbed the apple straight through, the knife quivering upright from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She plucked a damp tissue from the box, cleaning her hands with deliberate slowness. Lifting her gaze, she swept the room with a level, challenging stare.&#34;Well?Still standing around? Planning to make yourselves at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shook off the last traces of panic with a sharp,mocking laugh. The sound echoed off the office walls,brittle with forced bravado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite himself, the phantom sting of Daniela&#39;s blade haunted him-like she&#39;d skewered his chest instead of the apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he clung to the idea she was bluffing. In the end,she&#39;d let him walk out unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing struck him as almost pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking out his jacket and forcing down his humiliation,Josh strode for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other McCoy brothers hesitated, trading wary looks, then wordlessly trailed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they spilled onto the pavement outside the company buildin, Ethan broke the silence, sounding lost.&#34;Wait,that&#39;s it? Seriously?What about my money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad planted his hands on his hips, jaw clenched in exasperation. &#34;All that talk from Daniela about getting your money back-and what did she actually do? Just threw out a few empty threats.&#34; He let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. &#34;Honestly,she&#39;s way too soft for this. If a man had been in charge,do you really think it would&#39;ve ended like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s lips curled in a sour smirk. &#34;Yeah, right. Now what am I supposed to do about my thirty billion?That&#39;s it-just vanished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze turned cold, his jaw clenched tight.He hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to come up short, but there was no way he&#39;d criticize her in front of outsiders. &#34;That&#39;s enough. We&#39;re done here. Go home,all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Hamilton stepped away, Ethan spun on Brad, his frustration spilling over. &#34;What a disaster! Not only have I cut Josh off completely,but Daniela couldn&#39;t even recover a cent for me. I&#39;m out thirty billion and stuck with nothing. Maybe you were right all along.I should&#39;ve trusted Josh. Now, thanks to Daniela, I&#39;ve lost everything and made an enemy out of him. What the hell did I do to deserve this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad could only shrug, offering a thin thread of hope.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s not over yet. Sometimes things turn around when you least expect it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head, bitterness etched into his features. &#34;You always say that, Brad. Every time you get that stubborn look in your eyes and push ahead without a plan, it blows up in your face. You&#39;ve never won that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two brothers exchanged a long, silent look-defeat and regret reflecting in both their eyes, heavy as a stone.</p>
