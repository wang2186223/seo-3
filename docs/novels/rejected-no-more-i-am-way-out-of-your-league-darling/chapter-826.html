                <p>Cedric and Daniela shared a look, both of them trying not to laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come Nikolas gets to stay, but I don&#39;t?&#34; Damon stared at her through the steam rising off his untouched plate. &#34;I want to stay here too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sipped her soup, barely looking up. &#34;I don&#39;t make those calls. Ask Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave Cedric a look. It wasn&#39;t friendly. Still, he had to speak up. &#34;Give me a room, a big and spacious one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas showed up, Cedric didn&#39;t think much. The guy had no place to go, so he let him crash for a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it felt like Nikolas wasn&#39;t planning to leave anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, Cedric had a sinking feeling both men were far too interested in his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no room left. You and Nikolas need to pack up today. We just opened a hotel. If money&#39;s tight that&#39;s your best bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked. &#34;No room? The one I&#39;ve been using seems perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already finished her meal. She stood up and went upstairs, looking as if the noise behind her didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came back down later wearing loungewear, her hair damp and loose, while the guys were still bickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon froze when he saw her. He couldn&#39;t help blurting out, &#34;Shim, you could wear a sack and still look stunning. Even your loungewear looks designer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious he had a thing for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t spare him a glance. She reached for .her laptop and got straight to work. She hadn&#39;t come to Oiscoll to deal with nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, she slipped into McCoy Group&#39;s backend. But she still didn&#39;t find what she was looking for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came over quietly, set a plate of fruit beside her, and glanced at her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She angled the laptop toward him so he could see better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your time,&#34; he said, his voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rested her head on her palm, fingertips moving across the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon noticed the two of them and made their way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as they leaned in, Daniela snapped the screen shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon just stood there, lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniea picked up her laptop and rose from her seat. &#34;I&#39;m going upstairsS111she told Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at Damon, puzzled. &#34;Did she just dismiss us? We&#39;re just trying to help, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pretended not to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at both men. &#34;You want me to walk you out, or can you find your own way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Daniela stepped into the dining room and found Damon and Nikolas already seated and eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon figured she might say hello or ask why he was still around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t. She just scrolled through her phone while grabbing a sandwich like they weren&#39;t even there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came in not long after, wiping sweat from his brow after his run. Whatever they talked about next felt like background noise to the two guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon frowned and leaned closer to Nikolas. &#34;Hey. Are they straight up ignoring us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t even blink. After a few days of this, he&#39;d gotten used to it. &#34;You better get used to it. When she said Cedric handles the house, she meant it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face twisted, heat creeping up his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, while Damon was playing video games with Carol, his phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking, he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes on the screen and said, &#34;Carol, this game your company made? Top-notch. Graphics,flow,story-it&#39;s all there. You sure you won&#39;t take investors? I&#39;m serious. I&#39;d invest in a heartbeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the call, Hamilton&#39;s jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Carol&#39;s voice came through, laughing. &#34;We don&#39;t need outside investors. Or maybe you should ask Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, still not glancing at his phone, lit up. &#34;So if Cedric gives the green light, I&#39;m in? Wait-this is still part of Daniela&#39;s business,right? Shouldn&#39;t she have a say too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he blink down at his phone. The call had been live the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol opened her mouth to respond, but stopped when Damon shot up like he&#39;d been zapped.&#34;U,give me a sec.&#34; He cupped the phone and whispered, &#34;I&#39;ll take this outside. Just a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he made a quick exit, phone pressed to his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; Damon said, ducking into the hallway. &#34;Dad, what are you doing calling me right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s memory snapped to Damon&#39;s overly friendly tone with Carol. His voice turned sharp.&#34;Oh,,I&#39;m sorry. Am I crashing your charm campaign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon scratched at his temple. &#34;No, no. Not at all. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone cooled, but the edge stayed. &#34;You seriously have to ask? Did you forget why you&#39;re even there? Because it sounds like you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon straightened, trying to recover. &#34;Of course not. I know why I&#39;m here. I haven&#39;t forgotten I&#39;m supposed to gather Daniela&#39;s intel.&#34; Hamilton let out a quiet scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Damon and Carol chat like old friends had rubbed him the wrong way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two sounded like they&#39;d known each other for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took a breath, holding back his irritation. &#34;You&#39;ve been there for days. What have you actually found?&#34;</p>
