                <p>Katrina maintained her plastered smile, barely managing to navigate through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was concocting an excuse, Joyce, without a glance away from Lillian&#39;s phone, said nonchalantly,&#34;Mom, there&#39;s a pen in the cabinet. Fetch the black one-it leaves a clearer mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart nearly stopped. She gawked at Joyce, her mind whirling in disbelief. Was this dumb girl truly her flesh and blood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, seeing no escape, reluctantly picked up the pen and started to write the IOU.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to specifying the amount, he hesitated.Instead of the staggering 80 million, he penned just 1million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught the figure and chuckled.′′Amillion? How lavish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re aware of my plight. I&#39;m not getting any younger, and funds are tight. This is all I could muster-saved penny by penny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hardly batted an eyelid. She hadn&#39;t returned for their wealth. With a dismissive wave, she turned and called,&#34;Josie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie emerged promptly from the kitchen, her smile radiant as she presented Daniela with a plate adorned with fruit. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then handed her the IOU.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie glanced at the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is one million,&#34; Daniela stated plainly. &#34;Spend it on snacks for Dodo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s mind short-circuited. &#34;Who?&#34; he blurted out, flabbergasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was Dodo? Spending a million on snacks? Absurd! Joyce, still engrossed in the game, added without looking up, &#34;Dodo is Daniela&#39;s dog.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face flushed a deep red with anger, but before he could erupt, Katrina seized his arm, pulling him back with a cautionary squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Caiden composed himself but remained planted in his spot, his pride wounded but intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sensed his lingering urge to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, after a tense silence, Caiden ventured cautiously, &#34;Daniela, now that you&#39;ve accepted the money, it shouldn&#39;t matter what it&#39;s for-what matters is that it&#39;s yours. About that contract we signed to dissolve our father-daughter bond-can we declare it null and void?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, a slice of fruit poised halfway to her lips. She met his gaze, her smile tinged with sarcasm.&#34;Oh? Having second thoughts? Realized that your daughter knows her way around money, and now you want her back after casting her aside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly how it went down, though Caiden would never admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s words always had a way of slicing to the core, and he couldn&#39;t see why. This wasn&#39;t the same sweet, wide-eyed little girl he once knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, how can you be so cynical about your father?&#34; Katrina interjected hastily, her voice dripping with insincerity. &#34;You&#39;re his blood. He&#39;s regretted severing ties ever since. Regardless of your financial status, he would&#39;ve welcomed you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Is that so?&#34; Her response dripped with disinterest, barely indulging Katrina&#39;s plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina persisted, undeterred. &#34;You&#39;re not yet wed, Daniela, and don&#39;t understand. A daughter needs her kin. The support of your family is your shield against mistreatment in marriage.&#34; Her words were calculated,cloaked in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh.&#34;Oh,really? I was married once, remember? And wasn&#39;t it around that time Caiden chose to cut me loose?&#34;. Katrina was at a loss for words. How could she have overlooked that? She fidgeted with her hair awkwardly.&#34;Well,perhaps there were some misunderstandings back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Daniela státed, her voice cold as she tossed a pomegranate onto her plate. &#34;Misunderstanding or not, it&#39;s immaterial to me. But if you want me back in this family, it has to be on my terms. I&#39;m not the unknown I once was. I&#39;m now CEO of Elite Lux. You can&#39;t just cast me aside and pick me up when it&#39;s convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes sparkled at Daniela&#39;s declaration. &#34;Absolutely, Daniela! You&#39;ve not same anymore-truly a tale of triumph. You deserve every bit of respect. We&#39;ll do everything to reclaim your place in the family. I&#39;ll have your father contact a lawyer to draft a reinstatement agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, Katrina was already plotting. If she orchestrated this agreement, she might manage to carve out a share of Daniela&#39;s wealth for the family. That would be the real windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Katrina could revel in her scheming, Joyce, still tethered to Lillian&#39;s phone, spoke up without raising her head. &#34;Mom, you&#39;re overcomplicating things. Elie Lux has top-notch lawyers. If Daniela wants,they can draft that agreement in no time. Why bother with all this fuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce remained fixated on her game, oblivious to Katrina&#39;s machinations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small smile, and before Katrina could object, she chimed in, &#34;Joyce is correct. Let Elite Lux&#39;s legal team handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stiffened, her features hardening. Elite Lux&#39;s legal team would take over? How could she manipulate the situation then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before storming upstairs, Katrina shot Joyce a venomous glance, who remained blissfully unaware of her mother&#39;s turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, meanwhile, was kneeling beside Daniela, grinning like an ardent admirer.&#34;Daniela, could you grant me a glowing skin? Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina inhaled sharply, appalled at the scene. Was this really her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded by simply handing over her phone to Joyce. Joyce was stunned. &#34;You&#39;re letting me use your phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, this was merely a beta test-the more user feedback, the better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nearly dropped to her knees in gratitude. &#34;Can I share this on my social media?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Free advertising? Why not? Daniela nodded again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as Katrina descended for a drink, she was met by the surreal sight of Joyce kneeling before Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat regally before her, her cold gaze radiating authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce! What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had devoted her life to boosting Joyce&#39;s status, yet here was her daughter, discarding it all to grove before Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared as though she was atoning for some dire transgression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt her sanity slipping away.</p>
