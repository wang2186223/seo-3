                <p>&#34;I am really happy,&#34; Cedric admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Once everything is settled,promise you a grand wedding. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric held Daniela in a warm embrace. Knowing her distaste for unnecessary complications, he leaned close, his voice a whisper meant only for her. &#34;More than a wedding,I&#39;d rather...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice tapered into a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s cheeks flushed as she glanced up at Cedric. &#34;Is that all you daydream about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, unabashed. &#34;Let&#39;s wait until we&#39;re back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at the Harper family residence-too many prying eyes there! We&#39;ll head to our own home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opulent villa he had acquired for a staggering five billion dollars had become the talk of the town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone whispered that it was the love nest for him and his future wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, it was intended for Daniela. Hearing her suggest it, Cedric&#39;s heart swelled with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his embrace, as if fearing she could vanish into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Cedric sighed deeply. &#34;Let&#39;s wrap up our affairs swiftly, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded and reciprocated his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they cleared their current hurdles, she hoped to give Cedric two children, adding branches to his family tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their intimate moment was shattered by a knock at the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric reluctantly parted. Cedric stole a quick kiss and gently squeezed her waist before stepping back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; Daniela called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina burst into the room, her entrance so frantic she nearly tripped over her own feet. &#34;Daniela,you must rescue Joyce this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina collapsed to her knees, clutching desperately at Daniela&#39;s skirt. &#34;Joyce has thrown herself into that venture, and now, with Milo vanished with all the money, she&#39;s the one in the crosshairs. The company owes a hundred million, and they&#39;re threatening her life if she can&#39;t settle the debts. Daniela, I implore you. She&#39;s your stepsister. You can&#39;t just stand by and watch her perish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked down at Katrina, who was groveling on the floor. She recalled the opportunity Alexander had unwittingly disrupted, now seemingly returned to her. A sly smirk crossed her face. &#34;I can&#39;t help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice quivered as she remained kneeling. &#34;I know l&#39;ve wronged you in the past. I was harsh, acting out of fear of being not accepted by you after marrying your father. Daniela, it was never my intention. I&#39;m truly sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina bowed her head repeatedly, each nod echoing in the tense silence of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed her with a frosty detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| acknowledge my mistakes, Daniela. Just give me a chance to make things right. Please, save Joyce.She&#39;s still so young. If you turn your back now, she might not survive this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s plea rasped with desperation, but Daniela remained stoic in her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like an eternity, Katrina realized her pleas were in vain. She wiped away her tears,standing defiantly. &#34;Daniela, you won&#39;t lift a finger for Joyce,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, her expression chillingly indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well! If that&#39;s how it is, don&#39;t blame me for what happens next!&#34; Katrina pulled out her phone and called Caiden. &#34;You wanted to sever ties with Joyce,right? Well, come home immediately, Caiden. I want a divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Katrina ended the call abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Daniela, her voice steel-clad.&#34;I&#39;m divorcing Caiden, and I&#39;m claiming half of the Harper family&#39;s fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a light laugh, spreading her hands.&#34;Sure, if you think you can actually lay claim to it, by all means,try!&#34;</p>
