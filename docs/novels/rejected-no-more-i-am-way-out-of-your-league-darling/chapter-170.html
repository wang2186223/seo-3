                <p>Daniela spoke with a stark directness. &#34;I&#39;m usually not one to make a fuss, but my patience has its bounds.If you all wish to continue residing here, I advise you steer clear of me. Otherwise, I won&#39;t hesitate to ask every single one of you to vacate the premises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dellvering her ultimatum, Daniela turned to the maid and instructed firmly, &#34;Marilyn, empty Joyce&#39;s room upstairs.Within the hour, I plan to relocate my things there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn Stout returned Daniela&#39;s directive with a piercing gaze of evident disapproval. She retorted sharply,&#34;Your overbearing ego is too much to handle. Rebuking your own father? That&#39;s a whole new level of disgrace. Honestly, fighting Joyce over tat room is stupid. You were fine in your tiny little roomn before.What&#39;s the big deal now? If you&#39;re so determined to move upstairs, I suppose | could prepare the baby&#39;s room instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn had barely finished her statement when Joyce nearly burst into applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the room was suddenly stilled by the sharp sound of a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone halted, caught off guard by the unexpected echo of the strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been observing quietly, relaxed his clenched fists and allowed a small, knowing grin to cross his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn faced Daniela, her hands shaking with indignation. &#34;What the hell is wrong with you? You actually had the audacity to hit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Did you honestly think you were above it all?&#34; Daniela shot back with a frosty glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Katrina&#39;s aunt, and I am considerably older than you! How dare you!&#34; Marilyn exclaimed,her hand raised in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was just pulling himself to his feet when another slap resounded in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela picked up a napkin from the table and wiped her hand. &#34;I&#39;ve already made myself clear. From today onward, I&#39;m not holding back. I don&#39;t give a damn who you are. To me, you&#39;re just another nobody. I have a short fuse, and I tend to hold grudges. Anyone who has wronged me shouldn&#39;t be surprised when I pay them back in kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn shivered under the intensity of Daniela&#39;s cold stare, feeling suddenly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really the girl who had silently endured hunger whenever she refused her food? The sarne girl who had meekly apologized to her even after being slapped?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then turned her focus to Joyce, who instinctively stepped back. A slight smnile played on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;You have one hour to remove your belongings from that room. Otherwise, I wvill discard them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage lit up Joyce&#39;s eyes, a fiery intensity taking over her expression. She turned desperately to Katrina.&#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Katrina, visibly disturbed by Daniela&#39;s outburst, remained silent. Caiden clenched his jaw tightly.&#34;Are you freaking crazy, Daniela? What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34; he blurted out, his voice strained with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Daniela&#39;s earlier claims were not without merit. When Brylee had unexpectedly passed, she bequeathed her estate equally between Caiden and Daniela. Brylee&#39;s generosity and kindness had made her beloved among the company&#39;s veteran employees, who in turn showed Caiden the same respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Katrina contended that entrusting so many shares to a child was imprudent. She argued that a daughter would eventually marry, diminishing her need for such extensive assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By reclaiming those shares, Caiden could fortify his position within the company. Furthermore, he would need to amass a considerable dowry for Joyce in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina insinuated that Daniela, still mourning Brylee&#39;s demise, was overly reliant on Caiden for emotional support.	J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She craftily suggested that if Caiden appeared sufficiently pitiable, Daniela would be unable to deny him anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Katrina&#39;s manipulative advice, Caiden acted accordingly. Predictably, Daniela relinquished all her shares in the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Daniela was merely a child, easily duped by Caiden, who deceitfully exchanged Brylee&#39;s lifelong achievements for nothing more than a simple lollipop.</p>
