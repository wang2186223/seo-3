                <p>&#34;If you were scared, why did you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s words trailed off, curiosity clashing with a rising sense of embarrassment. He yearned to voice the question, yet hesitated, wary of exposing his vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,perceiving Alexander&#39;s reluctance, began to retreat silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had nearly vanished into the shadowy entrance of the villa when Alexander&#39;s voice,laced with desperation, cut through the distance.&#34;If you were scared, why did you still shield Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed naive evento Alexander, yet he couldn&#39;t suppress it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sought not just any response, but a revelation from Cedric-a key to understanding his own crushing defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I love her,&#34; Cedric declared, turning around to lock gazes with Alexander. His words, simple yet profound, struck Alexander like a thunderclap. &#34;I love her more than my own life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the heavens opened up, as if to mirror the tempest raging within Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood drenched, not just by the relentless rain, but by the weight of Cedric&#39;s confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Cedric loved her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he loved Daniela too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His love for her was profound and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was engulfed in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s events had snatched away any remaining hope; he was utterly defeated. The promise he had just made to Daniela now echoed hollowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, footsteps echoed in the distance, stirring a spark of hope in Alexander. Believing it was Daniela,his heart leapt, and he eagerly looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of Daniela, it was Richard who appeared, holding an umbrella over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the chilling breeze, Richard&#39;s voice, gentle yet firm, reached Alexander&#39;s ears. &#34;If winning her heart is beyond reach, then make her hate you. Then she will never forget you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chilled raindrops traced a path from his hair down to his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Alexander&#39;s eyes; his voice quivered as he said, &#34;But Dad, I don&#39;t want to. Please, don&#39;t push me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not pushing you,&#34; Richard replied calmly, his tone laden with wisdom. &#34;I&#39;m showing you a path. March forward, and something greater awaits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head, his resolve breaking. &#34;No, there&#39;s nothing greater out there for me.&#34; With these words, he stepped back into the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard trailed silently behind him, understanding all too well the necessity of the heartache Alexander was enduring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the villa, Carol had Natalie pinned firmly to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distortion marred Natalie&#39;s features, yet her words remained venomous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitch, Daniela! Your downfall is imminent. Just like your mother, you&#39;ll die in agony! I swear,Daniela,I&#39;ll be the one to kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Natalie, Daniela turned to Carol. &#34;Have you noticed anyone suspicious trailing Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie lay quivering on the floor, her voice trembled. &#34;Daniela! What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol chose to overlook Natalie&#39;s outburst, focusing instead on Daniela. &#34;There&#39;s someone lurking in the park outside the villa.&#34; Daniela gave a curt nod, pulling out her laptop to access the network of surveillance cameras she had installed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s realization dawned, furious and sharp. &#34;You deceitful witch, Daniela! You orchestrated this trap,didn&#39;t you? How else could I have acquired the explosives so effortlessly? It was all part of your scheme!Who are you really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scrutinized the surveillance footage, pinpointing the exact location of their unseen observer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure in the footage was cautious, their presence fleeting and obscured. Their eyes, the only visible feature, peeked out from beneath layers of dark fabric and a concealing hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swiveled the laptop toward Natalie, her finger pointing at the enigmatic figure lurking beneath a distant tree.&#34;Who is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze shifted from the screen to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this the person who orchestrated your escape from prison?&#34; Daniela continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Natalie&#39;s facebefore she erupted into mocking laughter. &#34;Daniela, is this your grand plan? What are you suspecting? Do you suspect that the one who freed me from prison is the same mastermind who caused the explosion back then? Do you actually think I&#39;d divulge that to you? Beg me! lf you beg, I&#39;ll toss you the name you&#39;re dying to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s demeanor grew increasingly haughty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she had found Daniela&#39;s weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her eyes, Daniela would inevitably give in to uncover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she were ever granted another shot at liberty, she would not hesitate to kill Daniela.</p>
