                <p>Daniela noticed that Cedric was busier than she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was eating the meal Cedric had prepared, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid explained, &#34;Mr. Phillips had something urgent come up and would be back later. He told me to remind you to get plenty of protein tonight-he&#39;ll be checking up on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a low laugh. &#34;He&#39;sgoing to check? How&#39;s he supposed to do that when he&#39;s not even here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He tracks everything you eat. Before he left, he told me to not clean up the table. That way, he&#39;ll know exactly how much you left behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her voice softer now. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;ve never seen a man fuss over his wife like this. You can&#39;t just pick at your food tonight. He noticed you&#39;ve dropped a few pounds. He wants you eating well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela just nodded and ladled herself a bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through her meal, her phone buzzed-a new message from Alexander. The day&#39;s report, apparently,had gaps and needed to be resubmitted tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela suggested patching it up with supplemental notes, but Alexander wasn&#39;t having it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol rolled her eyes. &#34;Since when did Alexander get so dedicated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a sharp, mocking snort. &#34;Dedicated? Please. Cedric knocked a pot of coffee over the notebook.Everything&#39;s ruined-they have to redo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mischievous smile flickered across Carol&#39;s face. &#34;That analyst is hopeless. Should we agree to their request?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;Yes. They&#39;ll never learn if they don&#39;t at least give it a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander showed up the following day, with Arthur in tow.. As the meeting kicked off, Daniela spoke up. &#34;I have some things to handle. Carol, record a video of the session.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur shot to his feet, flashing a polite smile. &#34;I&#39;ll get some air. Mr. Bennett&#39;s got things covered in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze tracked Arthur as he slipped out after Daniela, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour passed before Daniela reappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was still presenting, but he paused, his brows furrowing in confusion.&#34;Why did you change clothes,Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement flickered across Daniela&#39;s face at his sharpness.&#34;Did l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did. When we got here, you had on a white dress, a limited edition from Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Daniela replied, &#34;You&#39;re imagining things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol rolled her eyes. &#34;Seriously? Daniela has been in this lilac dress all day. You&#39;re remembering wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander accepted her answer with a nod, though his eyes wandered toward the door.&#34;Where&#39;s Arthur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dropped into her chair and replied flatly, &#34;Isn&#39;t he yourassistant? Why are you asking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol arched an eyebrow, smirking. &#34;He&#39;s your guy, not ours. You lose track of him, and now you&#39;re asking us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reclined in her chair, folding her hands with deliberate calm. &#34;Are you planning to finish your report or just keep talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapped out of his daze, Alexander cleared his throat. &#34;Right. Where was I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his presentation, while Carol, already checked out, leaned in closer to Daniela with a mischievous whisper. &#34;So, what&#39;s with the outfit change? Spill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile flickered on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;I spilled some blood on myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;You did what? Seriously?&#34; Daniela bit back a retort; there was no point in denying it. Some things just couldn&#39;t be fixed on the fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela admitted, &#34;I couldn&#39;t deal with it, so l just took a shot of the tranquilizer.All good now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded Carol&#39;s face, only to be replaced with a sharp glare. &#34;You&#39;d better hope Cedric doesn&#39;t find out. He made me promise to keep an eye on you while he was out. If he catches wind that you took tranquilizer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never got to finish. The sound of heavy footsteps echoed from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women turned, tension crackling in the air, as Cedric appeared in the doorway, his expression thunderous.</p>
