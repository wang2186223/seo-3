                <p>As Doug stepped into the room, his eyes landed on Joyce, who stood on the balcony. Her expression was distant, and her eyes were clouded with unreadable emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, but before he could study her face, Joyce seemed to snap back into the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, she leaned in and kissed him, her hands undoing the knot of her bathrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug lifted Joyce into his arms, his eyes momentarily looking out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Katrina was doubled over, throwing up by the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smug grin, he flung Joyce onto the bed, ready to force more torment upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s stomach churned as she leaned against the gate, the world spinning violently. Looking back, she saw a haunting image-Joyce pressed again the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by fear, she stumbled away, too terrified to glance back at the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Katrina couldn&#39;t shake the sound of Joyce&#39;s cries. They rang in her head, relentless and cruel, driving her closer to the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, she picked up her phone and dialed her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,you need to help Joyce,&#34; she begged, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiar sound of shuffling cards came to an abrupt stop on the other end, followed by a long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Erika spoke, her tone calm and indifferent. &#34;What are you talking about? What&#39;s happened to Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, Doug&#39;s horrible! You don&#39;t know what he&#39;s done. I saw Joyce a few days ago-there wasn&#39;t a single part of her left.unharmed. You were the one who introduced he to Doug, and now I&#39;m begging you, please help her. She&#39;s your granddaughter!&#34; Erika&#39;s voice remained cold. &#34;What nonsense are you saying? Erika&#39;s tonewas dismissive. &#34;What nonsense are you saying? Joyce married Doug to secure a comnfortable life. Just because it&#39;s not what you&#39;d choose doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s wrong. She&#39;s clever and practical-this was her decision. Why would you stand in the way of her good life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt her strength leaving her, teetering on the edge of breaking down completely. &#34;Good life? Is that what you call it? Mom, have you even looked at Joyce? She was once full of life, so pure, and now,she&#39;s like a prostitute. Please, I&#39;m begging you-set her free. I know Doug paid you. Just tell me how much, and I&#39;ll owe you every cent. I swear I&#39;ll repay you. Just save her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, have you lost your mind?&#34; Erika&#39;s voice grew colder, dripping with disdain. &#34;Joyce is doing just fine.And what money are you talking about? Don&#39;t accuse me of things that aren&#39;t true! If you want to live a poor life, that&#39;s your problem, but leave Joyce and me out of it. Besides, how Joyce ended up is because of your so-called parenting, isn&#39;t it? And now you dare point fingers at me? Huh! Doug&#39;s generosity far surpasses anything Caiden ever gave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those cutting words, Erika ended the call abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sank to the floor, her entire body shaking uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit her like a storm-someone she once trusted implicitly had betrayed her so completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina racked her brain for ways to scrape together funds, but with no experience or useful connections,she found herself trapped. Her hatred for Doug burned fiercely, but she still found herself using the money Joyce had sent her, an irony she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, something inside her broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed a number from her contacts, her tone sharp and unyielding. &#34;Hand over a hundred million, or I&#39;ll spill everything to Daniela about what happened back then. I&#39;ve got nothing to lose, but you? You&#39;ve got plenty at stake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person on the other end, which had been trying to soothe her, went quiet after her sharp warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious! If Joyce and I can&#39;t live a peaceful life, you won&#39;t come out of this unharmed either!&#34; Katrina added</p>
