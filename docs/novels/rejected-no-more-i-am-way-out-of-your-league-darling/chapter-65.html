            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>With poise, Daniela pushed herself upright, her every motion a display of unwavering grace. Caiden was momentarily caught in a wave of emotions-tinges of regret and guilt intermingling subtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him with surprising clarity that Daniela was no longer a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Caiden stood there, lost in his reverie, Josie approached with her ever-alert senses. The aroma of soup drifting from the thermos caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes expanded in alarm, and with a swift motion, she yanked Daniela back a few steps, casting a disbelieving stare at Caiden. &#34;Is that rosemary in the soup?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was rooted to the spot, baffled and unprepared. The soup was a simple task left to the housekeeper.Yet,the potent scent of herbs lingering in the air hinted strongly at the presence of rosemary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s expression darkened, her tone laced with fury as she confronted him. &#34;Are you kidding me? She&#39;s allergic to rosemary. Even a small taste could cover her in rashes. How can you call yourself her father when you don&#39;t even remember such a critical detail about your daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Josie&#39;s piercing gaze, fragments of forgotten memories began to resurface in Caiden&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a faint echo of truth in her words-Daniela&#39;s allergy to rosemary. The memory had faded over the years,blurred and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Caiden&#39;s gaze lifted to seek out Daniela, it was too late. Guided by Cedric, she was already vanishing into the elevator, her figure a mere shadow behind the closing doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina reveled in her triumph. A satisfied grin spread across her face as she leaned in close to Joyce, her voice a jubilant whisper. &#34;The Harper family&#39;s wealth is practically in our grasp now. And that&#39;s not all-you&#39;ve secured the director position at Elite Lux! This outcome surpasses even my wildest dreams!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly ushered Caiden and Joyce towards the exit, fearful that Daniela might reconsider her decision. In the lobby, Richard and Alexander had quietly observed the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard turned to Alexander. &#34;Caiden&#39;s a complete moron. Other than Katrina, the Harper family&#39;s a bunch of brainless idiots. If you were to marry Joyce, you&#39;d have Katrina-and consequently, the entire Harper fortune-right where you want them. And Daniela? Should she prove too challenging, I wouldn&#39;t object to Joyce as my daughter-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw, his tone resolute. &#34;Marrying Joyce has never crossed my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard clapped Alexander on the shoulder with a knowing nod. &#34;Then brace yourself, you&#39;ve got a tough road ahead. Daniela isn&#39;t easily fooled; she&#39;s a cut above the rest of her family. You won&#39;t manipulate her as easily as the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung between them, yet a spark of determination ignited in Alexander&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s obsession with him wasn&#39;t exactly a secret. He figured it was only a matter of time before she came crawling back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was to touch on personal subjects or to discuss their joint venture on the North District project, it was inevitable. Given that Bennett Group was a titan in Olisvine&#39;s redevelopment sector, Daniela couldn&#39;t possibly progress without HIS involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time came, Alexander knew he wouldn&#39;t have to exert much effort. A mere hint of interest in reigniting their connection would suffice. Daniela would be desperate enough to fall for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an effortless assurance in his posture whenever he thought of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint why, but he was convinced of her enduring fondness for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander waited, his expression the very picture of calm certainty, his secretary found himself torn between comprehension and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear why Alexander felt confident-Daniela had once been wrapped around his little finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tendency to go out of her way for him had made a deep impression on all who had seen it, not least the secretary himself. Yet,there was a puzzling element to this calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The North District project was on the cusp of its inauguration. How could Alexander afford to remain so tranquil? Did he not fear another firm might swoop in and clinch the deal first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days ticked by-one, then another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Richard&#39;s urgent, furious call broke the serenity of Alexander&#39;s office. &#34;Alexander, where the hell are you right now?&#34; The sharpness in his voice sliced through the calm, sending a shiver through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was deeply engrossed in reviewing a minor project proposal. &#34;What seems to be the problem?&#34;he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where on earth are you? Are you aware that Daniela is on the brink of seáling a deal with Clayton Renovationtoday? You&#39;ve constantly boasted about your rapport with Daniela, your unwavering certainty that she&#39;d choose your side. So, what&#39;s going on? How have we ended up in this debacle?&#34; Richard&#39;s voice burst through the line, seething with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the phone, Alexander felt a chill as color drained from his face. Moments stretched on as he struggled to muster a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, he sputtered, &#34;Wait, Dad, are you really sure about this? Couldn&#39;t it just be a misunderstanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Daniela partnering with another company gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by a mix of shock and betrayal, Alexander&#39;s calm shattered. How dared she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the CEO of Clayton Renovation stepped into Harper Group with a contract, Alexander stormed into Daniela&#39;s office, all formalities forgotten.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was poring over the development plans with her design team assembled around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words &#34;Clayton Renovation&#34; were elegantly scribbled on the small blackboard behind her in a script that Alexander recognized instantly as hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his chest heaving and his tie hanging crookedly, Alexander stared at Daniela with disbelief and seething anger. &#34;Are you really going to collaborate with Clayton Renovation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback by his sudden entrance and the harshness of his tone, Daniela, still clutching her pen,responded almost reflexively, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in Alexander&#39;s eyes intensified as he fixed his stareon her. &#34;Daniela! How long are you going to keep this up? Do you really think these cheap tactics will capture my attention?&#34;@</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else, including Daniela, was visibly shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian propped herself against the table, her lips curling into a smirk. &#34;What&#39;s this? Trying out for the role of our office clown?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Alexander seemed oblivious to the light-hearted jab or the others in the room. His stare was fixed intensely on Daniela, his voice sharp and unyielding as he commanded, &#34;Get out, all of you. This is between me and Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could muster a reply, the elevator dinged open, revealing the CEO of Clayton Renovation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the multi-billion dollar contract on the verge of being sealed, he was wary of any disruption, especially from Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo Clayton, the CEO, stepped through the crowd, his expression marked by clear annoyance.Bennett, this is not how we conduct business. The deal is almost done. Do you think it&#39;s appropriate to storm in and interrupt like this? Is professional decorum just a joke to you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed, Alexander brushed off Waldo&#39;s hand and moved a step closer to Daniela, his determination undeterred. &#34;I need to speak with you. Alone.&#34;</p>
