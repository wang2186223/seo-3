            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose to her feet, pity flickering in her eyes as she looked down at Caiden. &#34;What a shame. You just wasted your final card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes stretched wide as he watched Daniela walk away. Panic clawed at his throat, forcing out a desperate yell. &#34;Daniela, no! You&#39;re wrong! You got it all wrong! Come back! Please, come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela disappeared through the door, Caiden realized with a sinking heart-it would be a long, long time before he saw her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The madhouse&#39;s heavy iron gate creaked open, then slowly groaned shut behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slid into the car, her silence stretching across the entire ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the closest bonds could conceal a knife in the  dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Caiden&#39;s kindness towards Brylee surfaced, each one slicing deeper than the last. As twilight thickened outside, Daniela&#39;s eyes stung with unshed emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home,Daniela climbed the stairs, shut her door and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she stirred awake, a new day had already dawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight trickled through the sheer white curtains,bathing the room in a soft,golden glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her eyes to see a handsome face before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake, Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed herself up and gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were out for quite a while,&#34; Cedric remarked,setting a bowl of cereal on the table. &#34;You must be starving. Freshen up and eat something.&#34; Daniela studied Cedric&#39;s face-calm, unreadable as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she stepped into the bathroom,let the hot water wash over her, and emerged a few minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric picked up the hairdryer without hesitation,gently pushing her down onto the bed before running his fingers through her damp hair, drying it with quiet precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft hum of the dryer filled the room,a steady,soothing rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rarely let her mind drift, but now, her stare remained locked on the floor, thoughts swirling like an unrelenting tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the dryer clicked off, she looked up slightly, only to find a bowl of cereal already waiting in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished the food quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want anything else? I can bring it up. Let&#39;s take the day off-skip the office for once.&#34;As Cedric turned to leave, Daniela instinctively lifted her hand, reaching for his, but then paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her hand drop and asked, &#34;Do you want to talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained standing while Daniela sat before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes settled on her from above. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself into the seat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in silence for a moment before reaching into her bag and pulling out the divorce agreement she had prepared in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; have a considerable amount of wealth. If we divorce, legally, half of it is yours. Here-take a look at the agreement.&#34; Her voice was steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained just as composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow heaviness settled in Daniela&#39;s chest. &#34;|haven&#39;t been the best partner, not as a wife or a lover. But I was happy with you.&#34;  Cedric didn&#39;t move, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed on. &#34;The Harper family&#39;s villa has bad energy, so l won&#39;t include it. But I have other properties-new ones. They&#39;re all yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond, his silence stretching between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip, eyes lowering to the agreement.Then, in a quiet voice, she added, &#34;If this isn&#39;t enough, there&#39;s another option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice dropped. &#34;What option?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stated, &#34;You understand that what I&#39;m involved in comes with great risk. So, if you believe what I&#39;m offering isn&#39;t enough, you can choose to stay with me. If anything happens to me, you will inherit every single thing I own. And I can promise you that no matter how dangerous my actions are,none of it will ever put you in harm&#39;s way. You will always be completely safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the words settle, silence stretching in their wake. Then, in a near whisper, she added, &#34;Take your  time. Choose whichever path you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned forward, picked up the divorce agreement, skimmed through it briefly, then set it back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at her. &#34;Which choice do you want me to make?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s teeth pressed into her lip, uncertainty creeping in. When she had woken up earlier, she had almost asked Cedric if he was afraid of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else would be, wouldn&#39;t they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleeping next to someone like her--a bloodstained lunatic-should&#39;ve terrified him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she held back. Instead, she put everything on the table,hoping-just hoping-he would choose to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long stopped believing in people and in love.Yet,with Cedric, a flicker of hope still remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was underhanded, maybe even selfish, to tie him down with material wealth but what other choice did she have? In the end, this was all she had left to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained eerily calm, an edge of cold detachment in his demeanor so unlike the man she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his stillness made Daniela uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated. &#34;If the risk is too much,you can-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me a child,&#34; Cedric cut in, his tone resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, her mind scrambling. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t about to let this chance slip away.&#34;I know what you&#39;re about to do. I also realize there&#39;s no way to make you change your mind, but in this relationship, I&#39;ve truly given my entire heart. If you insist on risking yourself and something happens, I&#39;lI be left all alone, which would be unbearable. I&#39;m asking you to give me a child, someone to be with me in the future. That&#39;s not too much to ask, is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lashes fluttered as she processed his words. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? You don&#39;t agree?&#34; Cedric pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela narrowed her eyes. &#34;I can&#39;t just hand you a child right this second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s reply was instant, unwavering. &#34;You carry the child. I&#39;ll take care of everything else. You won&#39;t have to lift a finger.&#34;</p>
