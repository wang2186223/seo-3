                <p>Since it was Daniela&#39;sorder, Ensley had to execute it flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Elyse&#39;s payment had fallen shot by just a single dollar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ensley&#39;s tone was almost excessively polite. &#34;Please wait a little longer. I&#39;ve already submitted the application. As soon as Ms. Harper signs it tomorrow,I&#39;ll transfer the money to you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse replied with little interest, double-checking the account number with Ensley to make absolutely sure there were no slip-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next day, Elyse had already burned through all her cash. So when she saw just one dollar hit her account,she was caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on with Ensley? I verified the account  number with her yesterday. Why send only one dollar? Is she testing if my account is still working?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second Jater, Ensley&#39;s message popped up.&#34;Di the money come through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse responded, &#34;Yeah, I got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ensley sent over a smiling emoji. Elyse returned one,convinced the real money would follow any moment now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That villa was massive-selling it could easily fetch her hundreds of millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that fortune, she could keep up her extravagant lifestyle. Maybe she could even find herself a handsome young man to spoil. Now that she was older, it was finally time to start enjoying life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept staring at her phone, waiting, but nothing showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ensley!&#34; Elyse&#39;s voice sharpened with anger.&#34;Where&#39;s the money?&#34;  Ensley replied, &#34;I already sent it, didn&#39;t l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s breath hitched. &#34;I didn&#39;t get it! Ensley,how could you screw this up? We&#39;re talking about a huge amount! Did you send it to the wrong account? Can you even afford to cover a loss like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ensley pressed her lips together. It was literally just a dollar. The phone call itself cost more than that measly transfer. But she wouldn&#39;t dare voice that thought. Elyse had a razor-sharp tongue..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did transfer it. I have a screenshot to prove it.Take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes landed on the screenshot-just one dollar. &#34;One dollar? Is this some kind of joke? Do l look like I need a single dollar? I&#39;m talking about my land compensation-the millions I&#39;m owed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ensley forwarded the land sale contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse stormed towards Daniela&#39;s office,she passed the finance department, where laughter rang out. &#34;Can you believe Elyse? Asking me for millions in land compensation? I was completely speechless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Ms. Harper gifted that land straight to Phillips Group for their amusement park. And this old hag thinks she can cash in on it? It&#39;s downright hilarious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elyse is greed personified. She played these same tricks on her own sister, and now she&#39;s trying to pull the same stunt on Ms. Harper. Honestly, having a relative like that is just bad luck for Ms.Harper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That old hag has no shame. Isn&#39;t Nina a celebrity now? She doesn&#39;t even look after her own mother,yet here Elyse is, leeching off Ms. Harper instead!You should&#39;ve heard her on the phone earlier-acting all high and mighty. If you didn&#39;t know better, you&#39;d think she was the one in charge of the company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood frozen at the finance office doorway,her face twisting with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation inside carried on. &#34;Didn&#39;t she once tell her own daughter to sell her body? If things are so bad, she can just sell herself now.&#34; The moment those words landed, Elyse stormed in and smacked the speaker across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela wrapped up her meeting, she walked in to find Elyse standing there, face dark with fury.She arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter, Aunt?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was smooth, unreadable. When it came to putting on an act, she was leagues ahead of Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sold the villa for just a single dollar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Phillips Group is setting up an amusement park. I didn&#39;t feel like charging them for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse bristled. &#34;Why? Sure, you&#39;re married now,but who&#39;s to say that&#39;ll last? I get it, you&#39;re in love, but what if things change? Your mother handpicked the villa as a gift for me, and you practically gave it away for free! I don&#39;t accept this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, overhearing, rolled her eyes. &#34;We paid full price for that place back then. You don&#39;t agree? Who cares? What right do you even have to object?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s frustration spiked. &#34;I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s aunt! If she&#39;s making reckless decisions, how can I not be concerned? Daniela, you&#39;re married now,but you still have to protect your assets! Small sums are one thing, but a villa that size? How could you just give it away? Are you even thinking about your future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Did my mother think about her future when she gifted you that villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stiffened: &#34;Let&#39;s not dwell on the past. I&#39;m just trying to remind you to be more careful with your finances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Understood. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was caught off guard by the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything else? What else was left for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa was gone. What else could she possibly ask for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse walked away from Elite Lux, pockets empty, eyes lifting to the vast sky where dark clouds threatened rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret crashed over her. If she had known things would turn out like this, she never would have harmed Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with no one left to turn to, what was she supposed to do next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse tracked down Nina. &#34;You should be supporting me in my old age. Give me five hundred grand a month, and I&#39;ll stay out of your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s response was flat. &#34;I don&#39;t have any money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had no interest in pretending to be a doting mother anymore. All she wanted was cash. &#34;You&#39;re a big-time celebrity now, and you expect me to believe you&#39;re broke? Come on. I&#39;m not asking for much-just half a million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina sighed. &#34;I&#39;m still new to this industry. Daniela gave me a shot, and that&#39;s the only reason I even have a chance at making it.&#34; Elyse narrowed her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re lying. Daniela didn&#39;t pay you? That&#39;s impossible! | know her-she&#39;s never stingy with money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina nodded. &#34;That&#39;s true. Daniela offered me money, but I refused. Since I live and eat with her, I told her to treat it as living expenses. Instead,she set up a fixed-term savings account for me-one I can&#39;t touch until it matures. So, no, I really don&#39;t have any money right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse squeezed her eyes shut in frustration. &#34;Why a savings fund? How much did she even put in it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shrugged. &#34;I don&#39;t know, but like you said,Daniela wouldn&#39;t shortchange me. Since my health isn&#39;t great, I added a clause-if anything happens to me, the money will be a thank-you gift for Daniela&#39;s support. It won&#39;t count as an inheritance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This completely shattered any chance Elyse had of getting her hands on the money.</p>
