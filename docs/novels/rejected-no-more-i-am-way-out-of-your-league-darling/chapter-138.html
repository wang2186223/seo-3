                <p>Richard tried to smile politely, but it came off forced and uncomfortable. &#34;You really earned that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;ve earned is nothing compared to what others have made. You know how much Raul earned?&#34; Marco raised his hand, miming a figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard felt his heart skip a beat as the words hit him. His chest clenched, and for a brief moment,he thought he might faint right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a quick glance at Alexander, his voice trembling. &#34;Is that really possible to earn that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having distanced himself from the business world,Richard only had a general sense of how large these projects were, but he never imagined the profits could reach such astronomical numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, still involved in business, knew these projects were profitable, but even he hadn&#39;t anticipated figures like this. This was more than anything he had ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned in disbelief. &#34;Are you sure there&#39;s no mistake? Could the profit really be this high?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Marco replied with certainty. &#34;Ms.Harper made it perfectly clear. Her company supplies the materials, and her team inspects the construction. Once the inspection passes, we receive payment as agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander squinted, his suspicion growing. &#34;Doesn&#39;t that just make you all her employees?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a sense, yes. Ms. Harper mentioned that the industry was once full of fierce competition.Companies would lowball their bids just to secure contracts, leaving little room for profit. As a result,contractors had no choice but to cut corners on materials to make ends meet, wvhich led to subpar construction. By supplying the materials herself, she guarantees quality, while we take care of the work.Once the project meets her expectations, we receive the agreed-upon profit. No one loses, and she gets the quality she demands. It&#39;s a win for everyone.&#34; Marco gave a thumbs-up, his voice filled with admiration. &#34;Now that&#39;s how you make real money.Her vision and bravery-I can&#39;t help but admire her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul nodded eagerly. &#34;Exactly! I even brought some gifts from my hometown today. I&#39;m hoping to thank Ms. Harper in person and ask for more opportunities.Working for a boss like her, it&#39;s truly a pleasure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes darted towards the group of contractors, and it was only then that he noticed the bags they were carrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The items weren&#39;t costly, nor were they extravagant,just simple, local treasures, but they were meaningful and came from the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard looked at Alexander and felt a twinge of regret for arriving without a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly reassured himself. The others had brought gifts, but he had brought Alexander. Surely a living, breathing person like him was worth more than any small tokens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela arrived, Alexander and Richard had been shuffled into a corner by the eager crowd of contractors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd surged forward, eager to present their gifts to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, shoved and jostled by the crowd,turned to Alexander and muttered, &#34;Is Daniela really this influential now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen. While he had been focused on Joyce&#39;s pregnancy, Daniela had silently built her reputation and earned the admiration of so many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast to these contractors, hardened by years of grueling labor, Alexander and Richard-accustomed to the comfort of office work-felt completely out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, when the meeting started, Alexander and Richard had been relegated to the back of the room,sitting on tiny stools in a distant corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sat there with a scowl on his face, but despite his frustration, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to leave. Pulling Alexander along with him, he stayed glued to his tiny stool, his face contorted in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, on the other hand, sat in silence.His eyes remained fixed on Daniela, who stood confidently at the front of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he felt an overwhelming sense of distance between them. She had risen to a level he could only dream of reaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization ate at him, leaving a suffocating weight in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all for your excitement. The reasonI&#39;ve called you here today is simple. As some of you may have heard, I recently acquired a large plot of land in Kaloria to build an airport.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went dead silent in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s and Alexander&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief,their shock clearly visible on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,convinced he had misunderstood, turned to Alexander, his finger trembling as he pointed to the stage. &#34;What did she just say she&#39;s building?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression stayed tight as he replied,&#34;An airport.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stood frozen, staring at Daniela in utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All the necessary permits and approvals arealready in place. I&#39;ve always valued the partnership model we&#39;ve used in the past. That&#39;s why, for this project,I&#39;ve opted not to go through an open bidding process. Instead, I&#39;ll be announcing the companies I&#39;ve selected to collaborate with. Each of them will receive the airport&#39;s construction plans and architectural layout. After reviewing them, please submit your budget proposals. If the pricing is fair,we&#39;ll move forward with the collaboration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, a confident smile playing on her lips.&#34;However, there&#39;s one thing I want to make clear. At Elite Lux, our guiding principle is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could finish, the room erupted in enthusiastic unison as the contractors completed her sentence. &#34;Quality over quantity. Money is no object!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s jaw dropped. They al know this slogan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a glance at Alexander, a wave of embarrassment washing over him as he realized they were the only ones in the room who hadn&#39;t known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s meeting was straightforward and efficient,no frills attached. She then started announcing the companies chosen for the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul and Marco, both selected, descended from the stage, clutching their blueprints like prized possessions.Despite their age, they were practically bouncing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard crossed his arms and shot a sideways look at Alexander. &#34;Just wait. Let&#39;s see what prime part of the project Daniela has lined up for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so,they continued to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the blueprints were handed out, and the names of the companies were called. Finally, Daniela announced the meeting was over. But the father and son remained seated, still waiting eagerly. As the crowd started to thin, Richard could no longer keep it in. He stood up quickly, calling out, &#34;Daniela -&#34; Realizing the sharp glances from the crowd, he quickly corrected himself. &#34;Ms. Harper, did you forget about Bennett Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond right away. Instead, her assistant took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bennett Group? I&#39;m terribly sorry. In the last project with Elite Lux, your company&#39;s work failed quality inspections three times. So, Elite Lux has decided to cut ties with Bennett Group moving forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell deathly silent, and every eye turned to Richard and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit them like a slap-sharp and painful,stinging across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett Group, once seen as the leader of the industry, the epitome of excellence in Olisvine&#39;s architectural world, had not only failed inspections three times but was now publicly blacklisted by Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a dent in their reputation; it was an excruciating humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s body seemed to crumble under the weight of the shame. His vision went hazy, his knees buckled, and he collapsed right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing he heard before everything went black was Alexander&#39;s frantic voice calling out, &#34;Dad! Dad!&#34;</p>
