            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela noticed that as soon as she finished speaking Cedric&#39;s hand,resting on his knee, trembled slightly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence unfurled, stretching between them like an invisible wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Cedric&#39;s voice broke the silence.&#34;Is that what you want? A divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the light in Cedric&#39;s eyes slowly dim, as if her words had stolen their glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he still held on to a smile-fragile, but unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept that same faint smile as he met her gaze,his voice steady yet gentle. &#34;Is this what you truly want?Does this marriage feel like a burden to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found Cedric to be an unusual man-complex in ways she couldn&#39;t quite define.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imposed his will on her, yet somehow, her feelings always seemed to come first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now. Beneath the room&#39;s dim, cold light, Cedric looked as though he was on the brink of collapse. Yet he swallowed the ache in his chest, still choosing to put her feelings above his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel much about it,&#34; Daniela admitted. &#34;I just thought it might be difficult for you. It takes time to recover memories, and everyone has expectations from their spouse. I can&#39;t meet those expectations right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric studied her carefully. &#34;So that&#39;s why? That&#39;s the reason you&#39;re bringing up divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, to her surprise, Cedric exhaled a long breath, as if a weight had been lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet hope flickered back into his gaze, chasing away the earlier dullness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s the case, and if my opinion matters to you,then I don&#39;t want a divorce,&#34; Cedric said firmly. &#34;This marriage isn&#39;t a burden to me, and the memories carry alone aren&#39;t something I resent. You don&#39;t have to feel guilty on my behalf. I want to stay married to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout it all, Cedric&#39;s voice remained steady,filled with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handled the conversation with the kind of level-headedness that left no room for impulsive emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he respected her deeply, offering her space to make her own choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I need to tell you something about myself.&#34;Cedric hesitated for a moment, as if wrestling with his own thoughts, then slowly rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was prepared to reveal his vulnerabilities, scars,and humility to Daniela. &#34;My leg may take just as long to heal as your memory. The difference is, your forgotten memory doesn&#39;t alter your beauty,but my leg&#39;s condition will change how I carry myself. I must be honest with you-if my rehabilitation falters, it won&#39;t merely affect my demeanor. It could compromise my health, or even more, in ways l cannot predict at this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat as if he were at a negotiation table,deliberately positioning himself in a place of humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stripped away every layer of pretense, exposing his wounds without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wagering everything on the honor of a businessman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Daniela no longer harbored any pity for him,yet he was willing to take the risk. He bet everything on one belief-Daniela wouldn&#39;t walk away from him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not something that concerns me,&#34; Daniela said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While appearance held some weight in her eyes, a person&#39;s character mattered far more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric realized he had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman he cherished most, despite all the darkness she had endured, still possessed a heart that softened in the face of sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, we&#39;re staying married,&#34; Cedric stated firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod before adding carefully,&#34;For now, we won&#39;t divorce. But if, in the future, this marriage becomes a burden, or if either of us finds someone we prefer, we have to respect that and part ways without resistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wanted to rush upstairs, but the security was airtight-he had no way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiousness gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paced frantically, like a caged beast,terrified that one night would be enough for Daniela&#39;s heart to sway towards Cedric. The thought that this could be his last chance-that Cedric might steal her away once more-sent panic coursing through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind spiraled with countless fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuck in a foreign land, he felt powerless. The vast network he had built over the years was useless in this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold sweat trickled down his back as he stood there for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, his gaze fixed on the illuminated Elite Lux building, his brows knitting together in deep frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He retrieved his phone from his pocket and dialed a number. &#34;Hello. Do whatever it takes to obstruct Elite Lux&#39;s operations-I want Daniela forced back to the country,no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela was back, she would finally recognize the stark difference in business stature between Cedric and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she&#39;d know who to choose.</p>
