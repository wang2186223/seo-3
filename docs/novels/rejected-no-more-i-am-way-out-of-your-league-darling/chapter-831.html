                <p>Hamilton sprang from his seat, moving with surprising agility for a man of seventy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked his gaze onto the computer monitor, where a single word stood outin bold that read, &#34;Saved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you hear me?&#34; Hamilton shouted, his voice booming. &#34;I told you not to record this part! Are you ignoring me on purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration poured out as he shouted at the secretary,&#34;Get rid of that part right now. Wipe out every saved copy. Nothing can be left behind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room looked at Hamilton as if he had lost his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, what&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the most secure record we have. The board is the only group with access. So what if it gets uploaded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our security team has the best programmers in the world. There&#39;s nothing to worry about. The record is safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, has Daniela been giving you nightmares? You&#39;re making a big deal out of nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shook with fury. &#34;You don&#39;t get it! Daniela isn&#39;t just any hacker. She&#39;s the leader of Cealmaur and the genius who built her own gaming empire. Her technical skills are remarkable. If she manages to breach McCoy Group&#39;s system and uncovers the truth about her mother&#39;s death and the explosion, she&#39;ll do whatever it takes for payback!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost her child in the explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? Daniela came to Oiscoll to get to the bottom of these things. Do you really think she&#39;d leave the comfort of her home unless it was something serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shareholders fell silent for a moment, taking it all in. Then, one of them spoke up, his skepticism clear. &#34;It can&#39;t be that serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen Daniela before. She&#39;s just a petite young woman, hardly someone to be afraid of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Our security measures are world-class. Just have the recording erased and that&#39;s it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary quickly replied, &#34;Everything&#39;s gone. Not a trace left behind. The tech team double-checked and confirmed there&#39;s nothing Daniela could dig up, no matter how sharp she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the board members shrugged, glancing at Hamilton. &#34;See? It&#39;s over. You&#39;re letting Daniela get under your skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Hamilton, you need to take a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, don&#39;t work yourself up over nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the word &#34;Deleted&#34; flashed across the screen, Hamilton remained uneasy, eyes heavy with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they truly fixed the problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or was age making him mnore paranoid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless,Hamilton left the conference room and asked another secretary,&#34;Did the behavioral analyst share their findings about Daniela? Any vulnerabilities we can use?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded. &#34;They called while you were in the meeting. According to their analysis, Daniela might have a fear of heights, but that&#39;s only part of it. Her real vulnerability is tied to her mother&#39;s death.Daniela was a child when it happened, and something like that leaves scars. The only reason she hasn&#39;t revealed her pain is because she&#39;s good at hiding it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do we get past her defenses?&#34; Hamilton pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That earlier scare with the recording still carried an uneasy feeling within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t shake the sense that Daniela only stayed kind with him and the entire McCoy family because she hadn&#39;t found any concrete evidence. She was willing to overlook things out of consideration for Cedric,but that wouldn&#39;t last forever. If Daniela uncovered the truth, Hamilton had no doubt she&#39;d come after them with everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about it sent another wave of fear through Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding a way to exploit Daniela&#39;s vulnerabilities became Hamilton&#39;s top priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the tension in Hamilton&#39;s voice, the secretary said, &#34;They said it&#39;ll take about a week of close observation, tracking her habits and relationships, to uncover exactly what makes her tick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a short nod. &#34;Get in touch with Alexander. It&#39;s time to strengthen our ties with Daniela&#39;s company. Have the behavioral analyst work with Alexander, and make sure he&#39;s present during every visit to Daniela&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; the secretary replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the secretary personally escorted the behavioral analyst to Alexander&#39;s office. &#34;This is Arthur Lopez. You don&#39;t need to put him on any tasks, just bring him whenever you go to Daniela&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, thesecretary leaned in to Alexander and added quietly, &#34;Don&#39;t ask questions. Just do as Mr.McCoy says.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he slipped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Alexander looked at the newcomer, he could tell right away that this guy had the aura of a psychologist. &#34;You&#39;re here to dig up Daniela&#39;s weaknesses, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur gave only a silent smile, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Alexander pulled out a burner phone, slipped in a fresh SIM card, and typed out a warning to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton sent a behavioral analyst to sniff out your weaknesses. Be on guard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hitting send, Alexander destroyed the SIM card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela checked the message, her face remaining calm. Cedric immediately noticed. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;Daniela passed him the phone, letting him read for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression tightened as he glanced over at Nikolas and Damon. &#34;Should I ask them to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head and put away the phone in her pocket. &#34;No need. Let&#39;s just keep our eyes open and see how things play out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric still looked uneasy.&#34;Who sent the tip-off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the blank number and shrugged. &#34;No idea. The number&#39;s already been shut off.&#34;</p>
