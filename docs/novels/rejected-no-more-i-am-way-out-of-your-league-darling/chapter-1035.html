                <p>Daniela&#39;s people were correct. Josh&#39;s car was actually.heading toward Daniela&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her gaze and addressed the wives of Kohen and Damon. &#34;Why not take the kids back to your rooms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women hesitated momentarily, then realizing Daniela needed to handle something tricky and didn&#39;t want to scare the children. So they guided the kids to their rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela never anticipated Brad&#39;s lack of competence.He even got killed in a one-on-one fight with Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained indoors, drinking juice while waiting for Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly afterward, a tremendous smash echoed at the mansion&#39;s barrier. Josh&#39;s car had rammed through the gateway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton flinched. He darted outside and discovered Josh emerging from his car, covered in blood, gripping a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood upon the knife remained recent, and Josh surged toward them. Hamilton reflexively shoved Daniela behind himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was momentarily stunned, staring blankly at Hamilton&#39;s back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his dyed hair, Hamilton&#39;s age was beginning to show,a few gray hairs peeking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood upright, thinner than other family members,and extended an arm behind protectively to shield Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned toward the house and roared, &#34;Every man,get out here now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His roar snapped Daniela back to alertness as Josh quickly approached. She instantly attempted to pull Hamilton behind her. Yet he remained still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned slightly toward Daniela and said firmly,&#34;Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re my family, and I&#39;ll guard you.Step away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked. Did he just say she was his family and he&#39;d guard her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh reached them in a flash, ruthlessly swinging the knife downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes widened as the blade soared above him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tried dragging Hamilton behind her again. The blade slashed downward, cutting a gash into Hamilton&#39;s white shirt and leaving a thin injury on his skin, blood leaking outward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and others dashed from their quarters.Witnessing the attack, he yelled furiously, &#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh appeared to awaken from his violent haze at Nikolas&#39; shout, glancing at Hamilton and then Cedric,who emerged fromn the kitchen wielding a cleaver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a metallic clatter, Josh dropped his knife and bolted without turning around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had unfolded so rapidly, stunning the remaining McCoys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded fast, brows furrowed,preparing to dash outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Hamilton grabbed her wrist,face ashen and mouth quivering. &#34;My goodness! You cannot step outside. Didn&#39;t you witness that lunatic? Remain here.Do not leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked downward and noticed Hamilton&#39;s legs shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no option but to stop. Hamilton didn&#39;t halt Cedric nor Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chased after Josh but returned thirty minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gasped, &#34;He escaped!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face was thunderous, obviously furious. Daniela had already summoned a doctor to tend to Hamilton&#39;s wound. Rising, she declared, &#34;Brad&#39;s dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s head jerked upward. &#34;Josh did that? He&#39;s gone insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela added, &#34;Seems like he&#39;s targeting me now.Take your family and return home. We don&#39;t need so many people here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton instantly objected, &#34;How could we? Josh is coming for you. How could we possibly leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was fiercely protective. If someone wasn&#39;t considered family, he showed indifference toward their situation. But once accepted, he involved himself in everything they did, worrying like any typical parent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Hamilton&#39;s trembling legs and smiled. &#34;Just go home. I&#39;ve got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, she felt faintly thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton protested, &#34;No way, it&#39;s too dangerous Women and children should leave, and men should stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced toward Cedric, signaling him to convince Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded and proposed Daniela proceed upstairs to shower first. She complied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric told the housekeeper to gather Hamilton&#39;s belongings and then coordinated transportation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood, hands at waist, declaring, &#34;I already said-I&#39;m not departing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric disregarded Hamilton and addressed the other McCoy relatives. &#34;You&#39;ve got one hour to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest glanced between Cedric and Hamilton,evidently respecting Cedric more. Thus, they returned to their quarters to collect belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gestured toward the seat across from the couch. &#34;Take that one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat, expression still furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, uncharacteristically soft,explained,&#34;It&#39;s dangerous here. You can&#39;t stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton questioned, &#34;Why can&#39;t I stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric elaborated, &#34;Daniela&#39;s an elite mercenary.Even pregnant, she can easily defeat someone like Josh.And I, as the Lone Wolf&#39;s leader, am more than able to protect us as a full-grown man. I believe you understand that well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked toward Hamilton&#39;s ripped shirt. &#34;However,you stand no chance in combat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton opened his mouth, reluctant to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed on, &#34;The incident just now proves my point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scowled, temporarily unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained blunt, unlike Daniela&#39;s gentler approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Hamilton known that, he&#39;d have chosen to negotiate with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,unaffected by Hamilton&#39;s reactions, sat upright,palms planted firmly on his knees, posture calm and firm, embodying a family leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton suddenly understood he truly had aged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, his choices governed the household without question. But now, they followed Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rarely spoke, almost never. But when he did,neither Nikolas nor others dared object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just earlier, Cedric issued a command,and they simply glanced briefly at Hamilton before returning to gather their things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt a storm of emotions-moved yet satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had someone capable of continuing their legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could finally relax and pass on the duty of overseeing his family to Cedric.</p>
