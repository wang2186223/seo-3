                <p>As the crowd pressed in to witness the spectacle, someone darted off in haste, determined to return with a hammer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed with unease. He turned to his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph gave a quick nod and hurried down the stairs without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon was moments from shattering the dice when Joseph raised his hand sharply, halting him mid-action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon looked at Joseph like he&#39;d been slapped. &#34;Joseph, are you serious? Daniela cheated and now you&#39;re taking her side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph knew he had to tread carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a casual smile and told the crowd, &#34;Hey, it&#39;s just a little family thing. Nothing serious, alright?Let&#39;s not blow it out of proportion. Go on, enjoy the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he was trying to smooth things over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers shared uncertain looks, then slowly began to heed Joseph&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stood as Hamilton&#39;s voice and will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking it-this was Hamilton subtly pulling the reins to steady the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was clear-Damon had undoubtedly lost the bet. Yet, as long as the dice remained unbroken,doubt would continue to cloud the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s name was etched in gambling lore-his reputation, nearly mythic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t something that could be brushed under the rug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph had stepped in at just the right moment. If he managed to scatter the crowd now, Damon could spin any excuse later without much resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given time, folks would likely convince themselves Damon couldn&#39;t possibly have lost. The event would slip quietly into the fog of forgotten things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, the McCoy family&#39;s honor would stay polished and untarnished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharper minds in the crowd quickly caught on to Hamilton&#39;s ploy. With a knowing smile, someone chimed in, &#34;Exactly! It&#39;s just a family event. We&#39;re here to enjoy ourselves, not to get all worked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, games like these don&#39;t take much talent anyway. No reason to pack in like sardines. Let&#39;s spread out a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man speaking now was a distant McCoy relative, clearly angling to earn their favor. A smile played on his lips as he waved his hand, encouraging the crowd to scatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph felt pleased with how smoothly everything was falling into place. He was just about to suggest drinks and dancing when Daniela&#39;s voice sliced through the moment. &#34;You lose and now you&#39;re pretending it didn&#39;t happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Carol and Cedric came back in from outside, a shawl draped over Carol&#39;s arms for Daniela. The moment they stepped in, they saw Damon snapping, charging straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Cedric stepped forward, placing himself squarely between Damon and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon scowled at Cedric, rage flaring in his eyes. &#34;Move! This doesn&#39;t concern you. It&#39;s between me and Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met Damon&#39;s glare with icy calm. &#34;If you&#39;ve got something to say, say it to my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of fury danced in Damon&#39;s eyes. He lifted his hand, poised to strike. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll tell you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could get the words out, Cedric twisted, launching a swift over-the-shoulder throw. Damon slammed into the floor with a bone-jarring thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon clambered back up, hair tousled and fury flaring-his dignity in tatters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Cedric a venomous glare. &#34;Daniela cheated! And now you hit me too? You people are disgusting!&#34; Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;She cheated? She was mastering the dice long before you even knew what a wager was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon reeled, the words striking him like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, arms folded and smirking, scoffed. &#34;Moron. Haven&#39;t you figured it out yet? She&#39;s Shim-the legendary gambler the world still whispers about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room froze in collective shock, silence hanging heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even those who never touched a dice knew the name Shim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, in a fabled, high-stakes match where lives hung in the balance, Shim had claimed the crown of the world&#39;s greatest gambler-armed with nothing but her dice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after that triumph, Shim disappeared like smoke, leaving behind only tales and legends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even now, her legend burned bright, etched into the memories of all who had heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Shim?&#34; Damon gawked at Daniela, his thoughts spinning. &#34;How can that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shim wasn&#39;t just a name to him-she was his lifelong idol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What proof do you have you&#39;re actually Shim?&#34; Damon triedto sound firm, but his quivering tone and shaken face gave him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments ago, Daniela&#39;s effortless handling of the dice struck him as oddly familiar. He had spent years studying Shim&#39;s techniques, attempting to mirror them. Could it truly be her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face morphed from fiery anger to deep confusion, finally settling into complete bewilderment. In that moment, a wave of helplessness crashed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela, lips quivering, as though the truth had stolen his voice. At last, barely above a whisper,he asked, &#34;Are you really Shim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,intrigued by Damon&#39;s sudden shift in tone, stepped in to speak for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously. The biggest and most secretive underground casino on earth? She owns it. Still don&#39;t buy it? Call Loser-the gambling expert. You&#39;re obsessed with this world, right? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got his number saved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s fingers trembled as he dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he hung up, he stood frozen, his face a mask of shock and disbelief. A swirl of conflicting emotions flooded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are Shim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was Shim-the very legend etched into the history ofhigh-stakes gambling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, Shim had been the north star of his gambling dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he realized with a jolt-he&#39;d just tried to challenge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Damon&#39;s men, still clutching the hammer, paused awkwardly. &#34;Should we still break the dice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon lifted his gaze in a daze, eyes settling on the tiny dice lying beneath the raised hammer. He slowly shook his head, defeat heavy in his voice. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
