                <p>Killian couldn&#39;t shake off his restlessness and insisted that Cedric take him to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric agreed and took him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they entered the building, Ryan was already waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here?&#34; asked Ryan, who had a strained relationship with Killian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian, who had been beaten by Ryan earlier, wasn&#39;t in the mood to respond kindly. &#34;Whnat&#39;s your problem?Am I not allowed here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Ryan didn&#39;t realize he had been the one defeated, Killian shot back, &#34;What&#39;s the issue? Can&#39;t I visit Daniela? Does it matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them headed towards Daniela&#39;s office, where Daniela and Lillian were enjoying a late-night supper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked over, grabbed a pair of disposable gloves, and started peeling shrimp for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian sat down in the chair across from them. &#34;Daniela, when are you going to fire Ryan? I can take his spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daniela had picked Killian to be the network security officer at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Ryan had offered himself for the role, and after some thought, Daniela decided to keep him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, Killian learned about it and started holding a grudge against Ryan, convinced that Ryan had taken away one of the rare chances to work closely with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? You think you can handle it?&#34; Ryan scoffed, leaning against the wall.&#34;D。you even know what you&#39;re capable of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian wanted to snap back, but after his defeat, he couldn&#39;t summon the energy. He clenched his jaw and gave Cedric a look, signaling his desire to sneak into the server room to check if the impressive work he had seen earlier was really Ryan&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, then turned to Daniela. &#34;Killian wants to learn some tricks. Is it okay if he checks out the server room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, as usual, agreed with his request and nodded. &#34;Sure. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she gave her consent, Killian sprang to his feet and rushed towards the server room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, Killian stood at the entrance of the crucial server room, his gaze fixed on the ceilingin frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did Ryan get so good at this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian couldn&#39;t hide his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan noticed the dark look on Killian&#39;s face and let out a scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you write those last lines of code?&#34; Killian squinted, his disbelief obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the proof right here in front of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian was left without words, his frustration taking over. &#34;How did you suddenly become so capable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan didn&#39;t even look up. &#34;Did I? Or is it just that you&#39;re too weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely defeated and disheartened, Killian walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan crossed his arms and glanced over at Daniela, who had been standing quietly beside him.&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to tell him you wrote those last lines of code?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it necessary?&#34; Daniela answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always wanted to know-why did you pick me instead of Killian. He was your first choice, wasn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;He was.&#34; &#34;Then why did you change your decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he was too loud,&#34; she replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian had never known that the reason Daniela replaced him wasn&#39;t because of his skills, but because he was too noisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Ryan felt thankful for being a man of few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does this mean Killian is investigating you? He works for Cedric, so it&#39;s your lawful husband looking into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded again. &#34;I don&#39;t mind. Let him try.&#34; But he wouldn&#39;t uncover anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was well aware that Daniela could see through him, so he decided to come clean right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Killian&#39;s been feeling down. He thinks Ryan has completely surpassed him. Ryan&#39;s gotten so good that Killian feels like he has no way to keep up. He&#39;s been asking me where Ryan learned all his skills, and now he&#39;s thinking of finding a mentor himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela heard that, she couldn&#39;t help but smile with a hint of mystery. &#34;Have him solve that piece of code, and I&#39;ll have Ryan reveal who his mentor is. After all, there&#39;s always a test when you want to learn from someone, right? Let that code be the challenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at her, clearly puzzled.&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you have Ryan consult his mentor? Killian&#39;s skills are solid,and with the right guídance, he could probably figure it out pretty quickly.&#34;</p>
