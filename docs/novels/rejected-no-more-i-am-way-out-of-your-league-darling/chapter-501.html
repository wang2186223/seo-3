                <p>Natalie, known for her refined taste, stood aside holding a glass of red wine, her eyes subtly wandered across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Doug came near did a slight smile touch her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was sure that today she would capture Doug&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore an expensive dress, convinced it would leave Doug captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Dury, it&#39;s been ages.&#34; Doug, rather short,positioned perfectly for Natalie to view his bald head as she looked down. However, she seemed unfazed,even offering him a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden watched from a shadowed corner, his gaze cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, Mr. Fairburne,&#34; Natalie said, her smile widening when she noticed Doug&#39;s eyes linger on her neckline. &#34;It&#39;s been a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her greeting carried a weight of uspoken meanings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug gazed at Natalie&#39;s face, so similar to Daniela&#39;s,stirring deep emotions within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clasped Natalie&#39;s hand, to which she responded with a timid smile, trying to withdraw her hand but without much force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fairburne, I am not a woman to be taken lightly.If you harbor real feelings for me, you must ask for my hand in marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Overwhelmed by his feelings, Doug nodded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie fixed her eyes on Doug, continuing,&#34;You must not deceive me. I uphold a flawless reputation.If I commit fully to you and if you trick me,the shame would be unbearable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug shook his head at once. &#34;How could I? I promise you, I&#39;ll divorce Joyce immediately ifyou choose me.&#34; A flicker of amusement passed through Natalie&#39;s eyes at his pledge, though she quickly masked it.&#34;But will Joyce consent to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug gestured dismissively. &#34;She&#39;ll have no choice.Don&#39;t worry. Joyce and I have signed an agreement that if we divorce, she would get nothing. She won&#39;t receive a dime unless I pass away. Joyce will be left with nothing but an eviction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Natalie arched an eyebrow and her smile subtly grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug,though in his forties, was very conscious of his health. He wasn&#39;t likely to die anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Once she was his wife, Natalie looked forward to indulging in Elite Lux&#39;s luxuries as though they were mere necessities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked down, a bright smile spreading across her face as Doug guided her into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their interaction didn&#39;t go unnoticed. With Daniela,Cedric, Joyce, and Linden all watched from a distance. Each harbored their own secret agendas as they observed the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the elevator, the air was thick with an intimate tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie leaned against the wall, breathing heavily, as Doug pulled a pack from his pocket and eagerly popped a pill intohis mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a useless man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fairburne, are you prepared?&#34; She spun around,snatched the rest of the pills from Doug&#39;s pocket,and pressed them into his mouth with a charming smile. &#34;Take more, love. It&#39;s my first time, and l expect something remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug, overwhelmed, swallowed all that Natalie offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere became charged, the air thick with a sense of endless intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shut her eyes, envisioning her future riches, and a smile crawled across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the man behind her collapsed with a thud,his body going limp after the intense episode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his fall echoed loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors creaked open, the relentless flashes of media cameras greeted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood there, naked. She gazed at the reporters blankly, and as she heard their sharp breaths, she gradually lowered her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug lay beneath her, lying on the floor, his motionless body bleeding uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh!&#34; Natalie&#39;s eyes rolled back, and she collapsed to the floor, losing consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers were stunned, torn between capturing images of Natalie or Doug, ultimately choosing to photograph both together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood at a distance, waiting patiently for the shower of photos to calm down. Then, she moistened her eyes with water, burst into tears, and made her way through the crowd to throw herself next to Doug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the event organizer tried to move Doug, Joyce held onto him tightly, crying uncontrollably and refusing to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Efforts were made to cover Natalie, but Joyce stopped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She insisted the scene be fully documented by everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the police and medical personnel arrived and declared Doug dead, a faint smile briefly appeared on Joyce&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before the gathered crowd, she bowed deeply, her expression gloomy. Turning to the reporters, she said, &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Joyce, Doug&#39;s wife. I deeply apologize for the tragic events of today that have interrupted your evening.I will ensure my husband receives a respectful burial and at the same time...&#34; A single tear slipped from Joyce&#39;s eye as she continued, &#34;I also ask everyone to stand against those who violate homes for their own selfish gain.Thank you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce walked away, she let two more tears drop for the cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, who had just regained consciousness,fainted again after hearing Joyce&#39;s final words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of the chaos, Cedric guided Daniela back to her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Daniela glanced back and noticed Linden&#39;s grim expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold gaze remained locked on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to shift her attention,something caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet corner, a man dressed in all black stood hidden, his cap pulled low to cover his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela immediately recognized him as the man who looked like Cedric. After observingeverything,he smirked and quietly left the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, who was driving, asked, &#34;Daniela, what are you looking at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pulled her gaze away. &#34;I think I just saw Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What part did he play in this whole scenario?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed, and she checked it to find a message from an unknown number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything I do is for you, Daniela. You&#39;ll soon see that no one in this world loves you more than l do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noticed Daniela&#39;s serious expression. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; he asked.</p>
