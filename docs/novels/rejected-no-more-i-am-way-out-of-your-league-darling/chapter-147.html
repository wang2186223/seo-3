                <p>Caiden had never imagined that Daniela would treat him with such indifference. After all, he was the man who gave her life. Yet, it became painfully clear that he could not rely on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came to the realization that the only one he could truly depend on was the newborn child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Katrina, her body shivering from the chill,understood Caiden&#39;s thoughts intimately after years of being together.She stoked his growing resentment and remarked, &#34;Daniela is truly ruthless. It&#39;s understandable she might disregard me, since I&#39;m not her real mother. But you&#39;re her father. She should at least consider speaking to you for the baby&#39;s sake.How can she be so heartless? Then again, those in business often show no mercy. Remember how her mother treated you? Had she not died so unexpectedly, you likely wouldn&#39;t have seen a penny of the Harper family&#39;s fortune. And now Daniela is just the same. She&#39;s indifferent to your suffering, leaving you to freeze out here. Perhaps she&#39;s hoping you&#39;ll simply pass away, making it easier for her to claim the Harper family&#39;s fortune for herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood silently, his teeth chattering from the  cold. His eyes, though he spoke no word,conveyed the depth of his chilI and bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt as if the entire world scorned him, offering him no genuine respect, except forthe child. To him,only this baby represented a pillar of future support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gritted his teeth, his voice a harsh growl as he declared, &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll camp out here all evening. Let&#39;s see if Daniela has the guts to ignore me tomorrow. If she can stomach seeing her father endure the cold,then so be it. But does she really believe she can escape the gossip? The whispers will start!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a veneer of toughness, yet he scarcely managed thirty minutes before his resolve began to crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Donning a bulky coat that Alexander had offered,Caiden and Katrina braced against the biting winter gusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the coat close, Katrina turned to Caiden and remarked, &#34;It&#39;s Joyce who still cares for you.Without her,would Alexander ever show such kindness?Iknow youI&#39;ve been angry with me over that disagreement with your mother, but regardless of what anyone says,Joyce and I have always supported you without fail.Consider this-who else would willingly give you her child? And yet, you forced her to agree to that harsh contract. Do you truly deserve her loyalty?&#34; Amid the piercing cold, Caiden clenched his fists, his teeth clattering as he made a vow. &#34;As long as Joyce&#39;s child remains faithful to me, he will inherit the entire Harper family&#39;s fortune. I&#39;m changing my will immediately. Daniela won&#39;t get a dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the shadowy night, a smile crept across Katrina&#39;s face. Her usual warmth returned as she softened her voice, her words a gentle caress in the chill air,comforting Caiden with her nurturing presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was slowly coming to terms with the realization that he had been a complete idiot to waste even an ounce of compassion on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter if Daniela was his own flesh and blood? She had callously left him to endure the cold outside alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night wore on, both Caiden and Katrina could no longer bear the chill. They sought refuge in Alexander&#39;s car, where they cranked up the heat to fend off the frostbite-inducing temperatures.With the arrival of dawn, they were back on their feet, calling out for Daniela across the sprawling parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had not anticipated the extent of Daniela&#39;s cruelty. Evening came again, yet there was still no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Katrina, the architect of their scheme, started to unravel with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital was pressing for a critical treatment for the infant, pushing Caiden to the brink of fury right at the doorstep of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The turmoil attracted a substantial crowd and caught the attention of numerous news channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of rolling cameras, Caiden exploded with rage,branding Daniela as heartless and vile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst it all, Katrina sobbed uncontrollably, claiming she was at her wit&#39;s end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers gathered in the lobby, murmuring and speculating. But when the hospital set a stern ultimatum, Caiden recognized that his back was against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all his screaming, insults, and public tantrums aimed at Daniela, he was left burnt out and stuck in the same damn place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no alternatives, he finally set aside his ego and approached Lillian. &#34;Could you please tell Daniela I want to see her? I&#39;m really asking here. I&#39;ll let go of my pride if I need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s smirk was unfaltering, her composure steady even wth the cameras capturing every moment. &#34;Had you shown this courtesy from the start, you wouldn&#39;t  be in this predicament. Elite Lux has dealt with its share of troublemakers. You thought you could intimidate us? Look where that&#39;s gotten you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes burned with contempt as she spat, &#34;Get moving. What, you think you&#39;re so important someone&#39;s going to beg you to walk inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted from two sleepless nights, Caiden&#39;s and Katrina&#39;s shoulders slumped as they followed Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they neared the doorway, Lillian halted them abruptly. &#34;Keep yourself in the cafeteria. We don&#39;t let people like you anywhere near the upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden closed his eyes, frustration etching deeper lines across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such an ungrateful daughter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrase echoed in his mind, a cruel reminder ofhis past leniency towards Daniela, making him feel utterly foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an absolute disgrace!</p>
