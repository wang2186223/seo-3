                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Daniela scoffed, sinking lazily into the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s indifferent tone made Natalie&#39;s lashes quiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her lip as her confidence slowly crumbled. &#34;Daniela, what exactly do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. Her lips, a delicate shade of red, curved gently, like a rare winter rose in bloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, take a guess. What do you think I want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left Daniela&#39;s lips, Natalie&#39;s heart skipped a beat. She eyed Daniela with growing wariness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed, like a seasoned predator watching its prey squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie struggled to find her words before finally whispering,&#34;What do you want to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela folded her hands in front of her, exuding effortless ease. With a calm gaze, she asked, &#34;Take a guess.You&#39;ve always known exactly what I&#39;m after, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the office door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric strode in, flipping on the desk lamp to cut through the darkness before settling beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie darted a glance at Cedric before returning her wary gaze to Daniela. &#34;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was calm, almost soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a way of making everything feel unhurried, as if time itself bent to her will-calm, measured,yet always in command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, keep pretending.&#34; Daniela chuckled softly, her smile pure yet laced with amusement. A sharp pang of fear shot through Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s keep playing. I just hope you can afford the stakes.&#34; Daniela&#39;s amused gaze bore into Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Natalie&#39;s spine, sending goose bumps across her skin. &#34;You want to know...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this was all your doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Naturally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Daniela confirmed it, a wave of fear crashed over Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her once-confident expression dissolved into sheer shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean from the moment I tried to get close to Doug, this was alI part of your plan? You were setting me up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;It started long before that. From the moment I first met you, from when you told me you wanted to join Elite Lux-I had already factored you into my plans. In fact, ever since you came back from abroad, I knew this day would come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at Daniela, terror creeping into her wide eyes. &#34;That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a serene smile. &#34;Believe it or not, it doesn&#39;t change anything. As I said, keep acting-I&#39;ll play along.&#34; Her tone was light, almost casual, as if she were merely discussing the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice wavered, trembling against the eerie silence of the office as a nameless fear gripped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on her-her fate had long been trapped in Daniela&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She now understood-Linden&#39;s hatred, his contempt, everything had been orchestrated by Daniela from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s machinations were too precise, too ruthless, and for the first time, true fear took hold of Natalie. &#34;What do you want to know?&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice trembled as the weight of realization bore down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny it-she was utterly outmatched by Daniela!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against Daniela, she was nothing but powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want the truth about my mother&#39;s death-every detail, every name. No one gets away with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rose from his seat, setting down a pen and paper in front of Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if I tell you, what do I get in return?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained unreadable.′′As you pointed out, the villa you stayed in is still yours. I can send you abroad for further studies until the scandal with Doug fades. Once people forget, you can return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether you resume as my secretary or pursue something else is entirelyyour choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hesitated, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the blank sheet before her, she spoke. &#34;If I give you the names, I want more. When I return, I want a company under Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of remaining Daniela&#39;s secretary made her stomach churn. Daniela&#39;s mind was far too dangerous. It was better to carve out her own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And one more thing, you can&#39;t harm my mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat up, her smile razor-sharp as she met Natalie&#39;s gaze. &#34;You get one-either a company, or my promise not to touch your mother. Pick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s teeth dug into her lip. Silence stretched before she finally spoke. &#34;The company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her decision was final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Self-interest always came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the lesson Elyse had drilled into her since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been the dutiful daughter. This was a world governed by laws-what real harm could Daniela possibly inflict on Elyse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to that reasoning, conveniently pushing aside the grim memory of Caiden&#39;s fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Natalie gave a decisive nod. &#34;I choose a company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she knelt by the table, pen scratching across the page as she jotted down the names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you know me,&#34; Daniela murmured, watching as she wrote. &#34;I already know parts of the truth. This is just to test your sincerity. If you write false names, and I uncover the truth later, you won&#39;t be making it back from abroad. Don&#39;t expect me to let family ties hold me back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s grip on the pen tíghtened. After a brief hesitation, she scratched out a few names-Joyce among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she slid the list over, she spoke with forced certainty. &#34;Every name is there. None are missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed the names before flicking a dismissive hand. Without another word, Natalie straightened up and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was pacing anxiously downstairs. The moment Natalie emerged, she rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, I just borrowed some money from Nina. If Daniela won&#39;t help, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze softened with pity. &#34;Mom, don&#39;t you get it? We can&#39;t win against Daniela. It&#39;s time to accept reality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single sentence froze Elyse in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence followed before she finally lifted her head, disbelief written all over her face.&#34;What did you say to Daniela?&#34;</p>
