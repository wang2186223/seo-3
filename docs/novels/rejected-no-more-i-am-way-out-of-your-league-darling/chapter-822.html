                <p>The staff member stood frozen in disbelief. Even Hamilton, usually composed and unflappable, turned in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment ago, the staff member had brushed Daniela aside without a second glance. NNow,he wore a practiced smile, returning her bank card with both hands and a respectful bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped to a deferential murmur.&#34;Please keep your card safe, ma&#39;am. We pride ourselves on discretion-your assets are absolutely confidential here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed like a thunderclap, leaving everyone reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t help but speculate how wealthy Daniela was. What exactly was on that card that caused a seasoned employee to abruptly change his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Hamilton, whose fortune outstripped nearly anyone alive, noticed the awe in the man&#39;s face-a look that suggested Daniela&#39;s wealth might rival his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned toward Carol, voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Is there that much money in her account?What the hell just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol only shrugged, as if this were all perfectly ordinary. &#34;Daniela always says it&#39;s just numbers-meaningless. I hold onto the card most of the time,but l&#39;ve never checked the balance. It&#39;s never mattered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, startled. &#34;Do you know the password?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle nod, Carol replied, &#34;Of course. We all do. We use the secondary cards for day-to-day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;So, Cedric knows it too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;Absolutely. But Cedric&#39;s never touched a cent. He insists on making his own way-says he hardly spends and doesn&#39;t need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned closer, lowering his voice. &#34;Mind if I see the balance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone, unlocked it, and brouight up the banking app. Nikolas&#39; eyes widened the moment he caught a glimpse of the number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the auction room buzzed as the auctioneer, beaming with practiced poise, turned to address Hamilton. She gestured grandly toward the pair of cufflinks on display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, let&#39;s begin the bidding for this extraordinary set of cufflinks! The starting price is fifty million!&#34;  A hush swept over the crowd, followed by a collective gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure was staggering. Fifty million-for a pair of cufflinks? Even for something this exquisite, it was mind-boggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had entertained the idea of bidding abandoned hope. No one wanted to challenge such a staggering opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat back, unmoved. He preferred to watch others battle it out first, letting the anticipation build before making his move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The early rounds felt like little more than warm-up sparring. He didn&#39;t spare them a thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitant paddles flicked up as participants tossed in their half-hearted bids. Nobody truly believed they&#39;d walk away with the prize tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number crept upward, crawling past the one hundred million mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton showed no flicker of interest, his composure unbroken. He preferred to savor the mounting tension, certain the grand finale would belong to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could already picture it-the hush, the breathless envy in every stare as he claimed the prize with effortless confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the moments he lived for, the kind that made all his wealth feel worthwhile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela had no patience for theatrics. Annoyed by the slow pace, she shot her hand into the air and announced, &#34;Two hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like a thunderclap. The entire auction hall froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the auctioneer blinked in disbelief, unsure she&#39;d heard correctly. &#34;Ms. Harper, did I hear you correctly? You just bid two hundred million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver. &#34;You heard right. Two hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calm confirmation sent a shockwave through the room. For several heartbeats, no one moved, then a low tide of murmurs swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is she actually that rich?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t the last offer a hundred million? She doubled it in a single breath?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; heard her company&#39;s brand new. There&#39;s no way she has that kind of cash already, right? Maybe she&#39;s just bluffing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No chance. If the bid wasn&#39;t real, the staff would have shut her down by now. The auction house checks everyone&#39;s assets in advance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the crowd began to realize-Daniela was the real deal. There really was over two hundred million in her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mouths hung open. All across the auction hall people could do nothing but stare.</p>
