                <p>All three McCoy brothers let out a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had taken charge of rebuilding New McCoy Group. A few Elite Lux ventures had started cooperating, adjusting smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company&#39;s first-quarter numbers came in strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, after seeing his dividend share, was so thrilled that he nearly dropped to his knees in thanks. &#34;I wish I were a Harper instead of a McCoy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s expression soured with regret. &#34;If I&#39;d known Daniela was this sharp with money, I would&#39;ve put in way more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad glanced down at his banking app. &#34;Why not put your earnings back into the pot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan opened his mouth to reply, planning to say he would-if Daniela gave the green light. But before he could get the words out, he spotted Jules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s he doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s tone turned cold. &#34;What else? He heard we got our dividends. What you don&#39;t know is Josh gave him nothing. He played me once. Looks like it&#39;s his turn now. I bet he&#39;s here to grovel like I did before.Not happening. I need to catch Daniela before she gets soft again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan burned with resentment. If Jules hadn&#39;t dragged him to Josh the last time, he would&#39;ve pocketed a whole lot more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, meanwhile, was deep in thought,reviewing Josh&#39;s latest financial records when the door flew open. One after the other,two men barged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton came in last and barked,&#34;What is wrong with you two? My daughter-in-law is pregnant. She&#39;s carrying my grandkids. Scare her, and you&#39;ll have me to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules straightened his spine. &#34;It was just a stumble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shot him a hard glare. &#34;Why are you even here?No one wants you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules hunched over, barely meeting his eye.&#34;I came for Daniela. This isn&#39;t your turf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan raised his fist. &#34;You&#39;ve got nerve talking like that. Do you even realize how much cash I&#39;ve lost because of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules snapped back, &#34;You think I didn&#39;t lose anything?I&#39;m nearly penniless.&#34; As he spoke, he forced out a tear or two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan rolled his eyes. &#34;Well, that&#39;s what you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her fingers to her temples. Cedric caught the gesture and narrowed his eyes. His voice came out firm. &#34;Take the argument outside if you&#39;re going to keep it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t speak often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Daniela got pregnant, his words had grown fewer. His attention stayed fixed on her. But when he did speak,people paid attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys turned toward him without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was calm but sharp. With his brows drawn tight, he scanned the room. &#34;Don&#39;t make me say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in Cedric&#39;s voice made them all uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan turned to Jules. &#34;Come on. Or do you plan to stay here and make a bigger fool of yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules looked at Daniela, who was already back to reading through the files. He glanced once at Cedric,who stood still and unreadable. With a quiet sigh,Jules dropped his eyes and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nowhere else to turn, he headed for Josh. &#34;Josh, we&#39;re family. You&#39;ve seen what l&#39;ve lost. Could you help me out and return the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sat comfortably, one leg crossed over the other,a smirk stretching across his face. &#34;What now?Planning to run to Daniela next? If you want to leave,that&#39;s fine. No one&#39;s holding you back. Walk out the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39;s face twisted in disbelief. &#34;You still haven&#39;t returned my investment. How am I supposed to leave empty-handed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh picked up a folder and threw it at him. &#34;What money? Take a look. Daniela&#39;s the one making profits now. I&#39;m barely hanging on. Whatever you gave me is long gone. You want money? Go ask her. Didn&#39;t she just hand out dividends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules scanned the report. The pages were covered in green,marking one loss after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This doesn&#39;t make sense. I just gave.you that money last month.It couldn&#39;t have vanished that fast. If that&#39;s the story you&#39;re sticking to, then I want access to the books. I&#39;ll check it mnyself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh narrowed his eyes, his face turning hard. &#34;Who do you think you are? You want to audit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Jules was thrown out of the company. He hit the ground hard. Strangers walked past without stopping. Just a few weeks ago, he&#39;d walked out of McCoy Group with thirty billion and his head held high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he sat in the dirt, fists clenched, eyes burning.A tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh,you forced me into this,&#34; he murmured</p>
