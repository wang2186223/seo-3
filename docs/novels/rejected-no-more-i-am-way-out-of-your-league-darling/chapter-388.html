                <p>Cedric entered the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists slowly unfurled, the tension in his hands easing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he so afraid of?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feared that Daniela would look him in the eye and tell him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there really nothing to fear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified to the point that he had buried himself in work,trying to numnb the gnawing anxiety in his chest.The thought that Daniela might not even let him stay in Elite Lux paralyzed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In love, it was always the one who cared the most who ended up hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had lost to Daniela, completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric returned to the office, he pushed open  the door to the CEO&#39;s office, only to be taken aback when he saw Daniela sitting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his fear, frustration and anger bubbled up inside him. He walked in briskly, his voice sharp. &#34;Why are you still here? It&#39;s so late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Cedric forgot entirely that it was Daniela&#39;s office he was barging into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela, ever the understanding one,didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she softened, her eyes holding a quiet warmth as she looked at him. &#34;I&#39;m waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s exasperation almost made him laugh bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was always so practical. Just moments ago,she had been firm, ready to walk away from him if he didn&#39;t give in. But the moment he did, she wrapped him in care and tenderness, showing just how much she had been waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t bring himself to accept this, yet,inexplicably, he always fell for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to keep his face impassive, but the effort was futile. Instead, he pressed his lips together tightly,remaining silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked toward him, a soft smile gracing her lips. &#34;I was waiting for you. Let&#39;s go home, alright?&#34; Cedric silently packed up his laptop cord, rolling it up with a methodical motion. &#34;I&#39;m sleeping in the lounge tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Then I&#39;ll stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric refused to look at her, his gaze fixed on his hands. He couldn&#39;t risk meeting her eyes-he knew his resolve would crumble the moment their gazes locked.&#34;No need. I&#39;ve gotten used to sleeping alone lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s heart skipped a beat at his words, and she stared at him in disbelief. &#34;Are you serious? You promised, Cedric-forever and always. I won&#39;t accept this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s anger began to fade,replaced by a faint pout.&#34;Daniela, this trick won&#39;t work on me. You can&#39;t just push me away and then try to sweeten things up with kindness. I don&#39;t like it when you act like this. I don&#39;t want to sleep with you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolute, clinging to the need to remain firm.If he didn&#39;t, he feared losing every shred of control in this relationship-and his future would be in jeopardy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a sigh, but as she turned to leave, she glanced over her shoulder. &#34;Alright. Really not coming home with me? The lounge isn&#39;t as cozy as home.Plus, no one to chat with you. Aren&#39;t you planning to finish that astronomy book we were reading together?&#34; Cedric was about to say &#34;No&#34;, when Daniela leaned in,her lips brushing against his ear as she whispered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fist, which had been resting on his leg,clenched instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to look?&#34; she teased, her voice low and seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s throat tightened, his eyes darkening with an intensity that mirrored the shadows surrounding them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Cedric grasped Daniela&#39;s hand,leading her to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek, limited edition car tore through the empty streets, the night air rushing past as the engine hummed powerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the dimly lit room, Daniela lay on the bed,her body drained of all energy. She teetered on the brink of unconsciousness when Cedric&#39;s voice sliced through the haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was cold and calculating as it locked onto hers. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t agreed today, who were you planning to show this to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted, Daniela managed to breathe out, &#34;Once things are settled, I&#39;ll use this to coax you back home.&#34; A few stray tears escaped the corners of her eyes,slipping down her pale cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was enough to ignite something wild within Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Alexander sat in Daniela&#39;s office with a new proposal, waiting for her to return the whole day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina asked, &#34;Why didn&#39;t Daniela come to work today?She&#39;s usually here before anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes, the familiar stingof jealousy burning within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already checked the surveillance footage-Daniela had stayed in the office until nearly midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Cedric had arrived and whisked her away with an urgency that was nothing like his usual indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had made him act so hastily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had caused such an unexpected shift in his demeanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take much to piece it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s thoughts mirrored Natalie&#39;s, and she bowed her head,her sadness settling over her like a heavy cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pressed her lips together, then pushed open  the CEO&#39;s office door. &#34;Mr. Bennett, perhapsit&#39;s time for you to head back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes, irritation flashing across his face. &#34;What exactly is Daniela up to? Is she intentionally avoiding me, not even bothering to come to work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disdain crossed Natalie&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander really did think too highly of himself. What had Daniela ever seen in him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she maintained her composed smile. &#34;You&#39;re overthinking. Daniela isn&#39;t like that. It&#39;s just that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, letting the air of mystery hang between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned forward, his curiosity piqued. &#34;Just what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that today isn&#39;t convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stiffened, processing her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Natalie, whose expression seemed almost too innocent. She chuckled, her tone light.&#34;Cedric seems to have quite the appetite when it comes to... certain things. And Daniela&#39;s health is delicate. Often after such nights, she&#39;s too drained to work the next day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed deeply, shaking her head as if pitying the situation. &#34;Cedric can&#39;t seem to know when to take a step back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a small laugh, her eyes glinting. &#34;But I&#39;m sure you&#39;d understand the bigger picture and act accordingly. I heard that Daniela didn&#39;t want Cedric to come back last night, but he threw a tantrum, and she had to coax him for ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie watched as Alexander&#39;s face darkened, the satisfaction bubbling inside her as she kept her tone casual. &#34;I just don&#39;t understand why she puts up with Cedric so much. If you ask me, you&#39;re far more handsome than him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the compliment, Alexander looked at her sharply,his eyes sharpening. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Natalie replied smoothly, her smile widening. &#34;Someone as accomplished as you would be the perfect match for Daniela. Cedric, on the other hand,is too childish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had ever flattered Alexander like that.</p>
