                <p>Kohen was convinced he was cursed with the worst luck possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No offense meant,&#34; he said humbly, bowing slightly while addressing Cedric. &#34;Father wishes to invite Daniela to dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen looked up and noticed Cedric was at least a full head taller, which only deepened his envy. They shared the same father, yet Cedric towered over him.How was that fair?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When and where?&#34; Cedric replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s face brightened. &#34;Seven tonight,at McCoy Restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded and said briefly, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen couldn&#39;t hold back his excitement and hurried off to tell Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked concerned. &#34;Did Cedric know? I invited Daniela, not Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen affirmed, &#34;I made it very clear that you invited Daniela. Cedric acknowledged respectfully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing &#34;respectfully&#34; eased Hamilton&#39;s worries and reassured him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At seven, Hamilton waited inside McCoy Restaurant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek car arrived, and Cedric stepped out wearing a sharp tailored suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile vanished the moment he saw Cedric had come alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced angrily at Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen protested, &#34;I did tell him you invited Daniela.&#34;He felt unfairly blamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,weighed down by recent long hours, wore gold -rimmed glasses to soothe his tired eyes. As he made his way over, his sharp features and calm confidence turned the heads of several passing young women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loosened his jacket and sat, saying, &#34;Cut to the chase. Why do you keep coming after my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared calm, ordering a black coffee immediately upon arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton observed Cedric&#39;s calm presence, admiration shining in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a remarkable young man was truly a perfect fit for the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his face to his posture and physique,he exuded undeniable elegance. Wherever he walked, he radiated the aura of a refined young gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded approvingly, impressed by Cedric&#39;s bearing and presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton told himself that soon he&#39;d contact the royal family of Loglil. A man like Cedric-he wasn&#39;t just fit to wed a princess; he could be a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Hamilton considered it, the more delighted he felt. His eyes softened gradually as he looked at Cedric. &#34;What would you prefer to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen had never heard such softness in Hamilton&#39;s voice; it was like watching a storm hush itself into a breeze. His eyes flicked to the side, curiosity sparked,just as Hamilton pushed the menu forward.&#34;Take a look. I don&#39;t know what you like. You didn&#39;t get to grow up by my side. I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sipped his coffee with detached calm, casually brushing off a woman who tried to ask for his number.He raised his eyes, ice pooling in his stare as he met Hamilton&#39;s gaze. &#34;This isn&#39;t a family gathering for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton parted his lips to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cut him off. &#34;You&#39;d better be grateful I&#39;m talking to you now. Next time, you might not have the luxury of keeping your cool.&#34; The atmosphere turned dense, as if even the air had stopped to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen sat frozen, caught off guard by the sharp turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one besides Cedric had ever dared to throw such bold words at Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton merely chuckled, unruffled, as if insult had turned into amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast Cedric a look filled with smug pride, as if silently declaring,&#34;That&#39;s my blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen could only sit there, utterly at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That expression was foreign on Hamilton&#39;s face-he&#39;d never worn it for any of their brothers, not even for Nikolas!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young blood runs hot, and pride burns bright. I get that,&#34; Hamilton said with a placid smile. &#34;But you should know when to rein it in. Once you officially take the reins of the McCoy empire, prove yourself with skill-not by using your sharp mind to squeeze the family business right now. That&#39;s not the smartest move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton truly admired Cedric, and his words offered him a way to retreat with dignity. Then he added, &#34;Still, I&#39;ll admit-the damage you&#39;ve done to the branch company proves your skill. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes remained cold. &#34;You&#39;ve got a way with words, I&#39;ll give you that. But I&#39;ve never thought McCoy Group was anything special. If that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got, I&#39;m out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton exclaimed, &#34;Hold on. Your attacks on our branch have gone too far. This is internal family business-I hope you&#39;ll back off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric heard him out and stared back with frosty indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When no answer came,Hamilton spoke again. &#34;I know you&#39;re still angry about what happened at my birthday party. I&#39;m willing to apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Hamilton, this was him showing his most genuine intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologize to me?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice turned to ice.&#34;You hurt my wife! She&#39;s the one who deserves your apology!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton brushed off the matter as a petty detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he was deeply pleased with having such a remarkable son. He spoke without a hint of pause.&#34;Sure. I&#39;ll find time to-&#34; Those words hit like shards of glass, freezing Cedric&#39;s face into a deeper chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut Hamilton off, his voice sharp as a blade.&#34;Apologize to Daniela in front of the media!&#34;</p>
