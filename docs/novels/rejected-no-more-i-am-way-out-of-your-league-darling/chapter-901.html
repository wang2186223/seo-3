                <p>Daniela and Carol stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton staggered out of the building across the street, visibly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol asked Daniela, &#34;You asked Cedric to help you reclaim the title of the wealthiest person because you wanted Hamilton to know the true colors of his relatives, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes followed Hamilton as he slid into his vehicle across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes. That was exactly her intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Hamilton had no involvement in her mother&#39;s death, she was willing to give him a chance to break off from the McCoy family. She intended for him to grasp just how corrupt the family truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#f he chose to remain blind to the truth, she&#39;d have no further obligation to show restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes, Daniela addressed Carol. &#34;He gets seven days. If he hasn&#39;t quitted by then, we&#39;ll proceed with our plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol asked, &#34;Do you believe he&#39;ll take your gesture seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reply was cool and measured. &#34;That&#39;s his burden, Extending the offer was my call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Hamilton was Cedric&#39;s father. She was willing to give the old man another chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, McCoy Group&#39;s shares held firm. A sense of relief swept through the previously tense people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sneered, &#34;What did I say? Panic over nothing. Those earlier market blips were just noise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alison chimed in, &#34;Exactly! Who could ever threaten our grip? We gave.Daniela too much credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick McCoy scoffed, &#34;Truth be told, this whole ordeal made it obvious-we don&#39;t need Hamilton. He sat on the sidelines, and things turned out fine anyway.&#34; Brad McCoy puffed contentedly on his cigar.&#34;Hamilton just wanted attention. Stirring drama to make himself seem indispensable. Honestly, I&#39;ve had it with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone mumbled, &#34;Hamilton has past his prime, and Cedric doesn&#39;t want the helm. Maybe it&#39;s time we found a new leader.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again,quiet spread across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave a crooked smile. &#34;I merely presented a possibility. Any outcome should be thoughtfully reviewed by all involved. McCoy Group isn&#39;t Hamilton&#39;s alone-it belongs to every one of us. Since he&#39;s stepped away from leadership, it makes sense to choose a new figure to lead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone saw that Josh was pushing for his own son to assume control, though he wasn&#39;t brave enough to say it aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules McCoy, who had kept to himself until now, finally broke his silence. &#34;If Hamilton&#39;s to be replaced,Cedric is the only one I&#39;d back. Who else here even qualifies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment made Josh&#39;s expression tighten. &#34;What do you mean by that? Are you suggesting McCoy Group is doomed without Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded. &#34;Exactly. And what of it? We&#39;re all aware of what you&#39;re plotting. Your son can&#39;t hold a candle to Cedric. He&#39;s not even in the same league as Nikolas. So drop the charade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Josh struck the table and jumped to his feet. &#34;What makes my son so unworthy? You&#39;re &#39;just bitter because you never had a son of your own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules, enraged, grabbed an ashtray and flung it. It struck Josh in the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brawl became a headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;McCoy Family Turmoil&#34; dominated the news cycle. Daniela stared at the broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, beside her, grinned ear to ear. &#34;They&#39;re.going at it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the following morning, Josh&#39;s son, Mason McCoy, was named the new head of McCoy Group. Josh now walked with renewed stature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People whispered that Cedric had been cast aside by the McCoy famnily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Josh and his family were seen at upscale galas and dinners, embedding themselves in Oiscoll&#39;s elite circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Jules began hearing remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s a prodigy, but if he doesn&#39;t want a seat at the table, maybe we should leave it be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Not everyone wants the same future. We&#39;ll be fine without Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Il agree. And don&#39;t forget, Cedric wasn&#39;t brought up by the McCoy family. WWho can really say where his motives lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; expression grew stormy. &#34;I know exactly what this is. You&#39;re all worried that bringing Cedric in will shrink your piece of the pie. But without him guiding McCoy Group, this whole thing will fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he stormed off, leaving the others murmuring behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jules is losing it,&#34; someone whispered.</p>
