                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond to the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared out the window at the scenery rushing past, his mind looping back to the document placed under Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a divorce agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the Elite Lux office, Lillian couldn&#39;t wrap her head around it. &#34;Daniela, why didn&#39;t you bring up the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela clenched her fist. &#34;I didn&#39;t have to say it out loud.He already knew what I meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian still didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to the vast skyline beyond the floor-to-ceiling window. &#34;One day, when you truly love someone,you&#39;ll get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bond that once felt unbreakable could become the sharpest blade, cutting deeper than any wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single conversation could tear two people apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Lillian was right. Cedric had so many paths ahead of him. Maybe walking away from her would lead him to something better-something happier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her own heartbreak? That didn&#39;t matter as much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela carried on with her days-work,meals, sleep.She slowly distanced herself from Cedric, her warmth fading into a surface-level politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel Cedric&#39;s unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel him pulling away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she, unwavering and relentless, kept pushing forward, leaving him with nowhere left to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was truly afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose the farthest business trip he could find and put as much distance between them as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had seen firsthand just how ruthless Daniela could be, and it unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Natalie approached Doug at that auction the other day, but Joyce is keeping a close watch.Natalie hasn&#39;t gotten a chance to make a move yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained unreadable, her presence as cold and unyielding as ice. &#34;If there&#39;s no opportunity, then make one. Host a gala under Elite Lux&#39;s name and ensure Doug is on the guest list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s galas were the crown jewel of Olisvine&#39;s social scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>C)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lavish venues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exquisite champagne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relentless media attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wasted no time turning to Daniela for help.Daniela smirked and flicked the invitation card in her hand onto the floor without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie immediately bent down to retrieve it. Linden stood nearby, his glare sharp with disgust as he spat, &#34;Bitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie remained unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If latching onto Doug meant enduring scorn, so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was willing to do whatever it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, who was Linden to her? Just one of Daniela&#39;s lackeys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie left Elite Lux, invitation in hand, and ran into Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie said, &#34;Daniela seems off lately. Any idea why?Did she and Cedric actually fall out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was plotting something. If Daniela and Cedric were truly over, then between Cedric and Doug,she&#39;d much rather choose Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina leaned against the elevator wall, her expression unreadable. &#34;Daniela and Cedric are fine. Stop overanalyzing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a sharp laugh. &#34;Fine? You&#39;re awfully protective of their marriage. Funny, considering you used to be so in love with Cedric yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She casually adjusted her hair,her tone dripping with confidence. &#34;Nina, no matter what, you&#39;re a Dury.Daniela&#39;s your cousin, and I&#39;m your sister. No matter what happens, you&#39;re obligated to help me. Got it?The Dury family&#39;s future depends on me winning this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina flicked her gaze towards Natalie, unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled an invitation card from her pocket and dangled it between her fingers. &#34;Don&#39;t say I never do anything for you. Here, I got you an invite from Daniela. It&#39;s your chance to rub elbows with some wealthy heirs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina eyed the card suspiciously. &#34;Since when are you this generous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curled into a sly smirk. &#34;Oh, I&#39;ll be needing a favor in return. Doug will be at the gala tonight. I just need you to keep Joyce busy for half an hour. That&#39;s all the time I need to make him fall for me.&#34; Nina shot her a look of pure disdain. &#34;Didn&#39;t you always claim you&#39;d save yourself for the one you truly love? And wasn&#39;t that Cedric? Now, suddenly, you&#39;re interested in Doug? That short,fat man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed, &#34;What would you know? Cedric&#39;s an idiot-he only has eyes for Daniela. So why should I waste my/ time? I deserve better. What, you think l should settle for Linden? That useless, hideous nobody? Just make sure Joyce stays out of my way tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie started to walk away, but after a few steps,she stopped and turned back. Her gaze locked onto Nina&#39;s. &#34;Don&#39;t breathe a word of this to Daniela.She and Joyce are on the same side, but you and l? We&#39;re family. Don&#39;t forget that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stepped into her car. Just before the door shut, she threw out one last promise.&#34;When I pull this off, I&#39;ll make sure you get your cut of the rewards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the car roared to life and sped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina narrowed her eyes and let out a sharp, icy laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped the invitation into her pocket, not even considering telling Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This whole thing was too disgraceful to bother mentioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Natalie wanted to go head-to-head with Joyce, let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing couldn&#39;t be better. Nina had been itching for some real entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at the grand entrance of Elite Lux, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through her contacts yntil she found the number she wanted.Then, with a smirk, she pressed call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;ve got something juicy for you tonight.Interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s it about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s lips curled as she lowered her voice to a near whisper. &#34;A scandal you won&#39;t want to miss.&#34;</p>
