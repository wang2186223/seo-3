                <p>With Cormac&#39;s steady support, Nina made her way towards the resting area. Midway, she abruptly turned her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, her eyes locked onto Natalie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly, taunting smile curved on Nina&#39;s lips as she faced Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That expression infuriated Natalie; she exploded into a furious tantrum, cursing and jabbing her finger towards Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director&#39;s thunderous voice finally cut through,forcing her into reluctant silence. Yet her glare remained locked onto Nina, sharp as a dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Nina found Daniela lounging in the living room,eyes on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I stirred up quite a commotion on set today,&#34; Nina admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot her a knowing look, a smile playing on her lips. &#34;Standing up for yourself felt good, didn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Nina nodded, a bright smnile lighting up her face. &#34;It really did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle as Nina happily skipped back to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Nina disappear into her room, Lillian leaned in closer and murmured, &#34;Cormac just won the youngest Best Actor award. Wasn&#39;t he supposed to take a break? Why would he suddenly accept this project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pressed on, puzzled. &#34;And he&#39;s starring alongside a total newcomer? That seems out of character.Why would he agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Because...&#34; Lillian&#39;s curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely lifted her hand and gestured towards Nina&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Lillian. &#34;Oh, this is going to drive Natalie absolutely insane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, the internet buzzed with the headline, &#34;Nina Dury vs. Natalie Dury-Battle for the Lead Role!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A leaked video of the altercation quickly spread,igniting a wave of online backlash against Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage sparked an outpouring of sympathy,earning Nina a surge of new fans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, a crowd of supporters gathered on set,cheering for Nina. She stood among them, flashing a warm smile. &#34;Thank you all for your support! But I&#39;d rather you focus on my work. Mr. Murray is so dedicated and meticulous-I&#39;m learning so much.I don&#39;t see myself as an idol because, honestly, I&#39;m just like you. A fan girl at heart.&#34; The crowd erupted with excitement. &#34;Wait, Nina!You&#39;re a fan girl too? Who&#39;s your favorite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a playful laugh. &#34;Who else? Mr. Murray,of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Nina treated her fans to a meal. After wrapping up filming, she lingered, chatting with them as if they were old friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, her supporters flooded forums with her words,and within hours, her follower count soared past a hundred thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, after Nina admitted to being a fan of Cormac, his supporters rallied behind her, showering her with encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden in the shadows, Nataie watched everything unfold. Her fist, already tight, struck the wall beside her with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had been silently observing for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie&#39;s gaze met Elyse&#39;s, she quickly turned away, her expression far from pleased. Instead, her demeanor was ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here? Come to gloat too?&#34; Natalie snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s heart ached. &#34;Natalie, how can you say that?Haven&#39;t I always put you first above everything? I&#39;ve been observing for the past few days, and it&#39;s clear-Nina fits this role better. You should accept the second lead and go back abroad. There&#39;s no way you can win against Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Natalie snapped her head to Elyse,her glare sharp and frigid. &#34;Easy for you to say! Do you think surviving abroad is simple? Do you know how many men I had to drink with just to land a minor role? Now that Nina&#39;s about to make it, you suddenly find me bothersome and want me out of the way?Absolutely not! I won&#39;t stand by while she gets Daniela&#39;s backing and I&#39;m left to fend for myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face twisted with frustration and sorrow.&#34;Natalie, don&#39;t you get it? Daniela will never let us go because of Brylee&#39;s death.&#34; Irritation flared in Natale. &#34;You keep saying that, but Daniela hasn&#39;t done a thing to us! You&#39;re just favoring Nina, making my life harder on purpose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse opened her mouth to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Natalie went on, &#34;Brylee has been gone for years.If Daniela truly wanted to punish us, she would&#39;ve done so already. Clearly, she&#39;s chosen to move on.Besides, Brylee was gone when Daniela was just five.How much could a child that young even recall?doubt she even recalls what Brylee looked like anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were up to her, she would never let a ghost from the past destroy the life she had now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, happiness in the present was all that mattered. The rest? Just meaningless baggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinging to resentment over a mother who had been gone for years seemed utterly foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse made another attempt to reason with her, but Natalie waved her off, exasperated. &#34;Enough! Stop nagging! If you have so much time, use it to persuade Nina to hand me the lead role! Or better yet, beg Daniela to show me some favoritism too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she finished, Natalie spotted Cormac stepping off set. She snatched a bottle of water and strode over to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, she intercepted Nina at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, you&#39;ve always been such an obedien child,never fighting with Natalie over anything. Just this once, can&#39;t you step aside and let your sister have the lead role since she wants it so badly?&#34;</p>
