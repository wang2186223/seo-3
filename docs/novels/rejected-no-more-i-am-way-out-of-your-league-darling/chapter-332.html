            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face went blank, his expression completely frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice broke the silence. &#34;Old habits are hard to shake, aren&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brows furrowed, and he opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela cut him off before he could say anything. &#34;Do you have any idea what you look like right now? Like one of those arrogant people who think the world owes them something.You carry yourself as if you&#39;re untouchable,expecting everyone to grovel just to catch your attention. You think you won&#39;t hurt me? There are plenty of couples who stay together even when they&#39;re distant, but we couldn&#39;t even last that long.We were divorced after just one day of marriage,which proves you were never the right choice. And honestly, how could you even compare to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like Alexander had walked into a dream, only to be ripped from it and slapped awake in the most brutal way. His went as white as a sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really believe you can compete with Cedric?&#34; Daniela&#39;s patience had clearly run thin.Though her voice remained calmn, her words hit with brutal precision. &#34;To me, you don&#39;t even measure up to a fraction of him. Just thinking about you disgusts me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she didn&#39;t spare him another look. She spun around and walked into Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained where he was, a cold emptiness settling deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been poised and polite, yet she had said his very presence repulsed her. The words hit Alexander like a blow, leaving him shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aimlessly wandering the streets, he found himself outside a department store. Through the glass  windows, he spotted Joyce inside, shopping with flair, enjoying herself, and acting superior with every small victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she caught sight of him watching, she glanced over from a distance. She hesitated briefly, then smirked and sauntered towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care for coffee?&#34; she suggested casually, already making her way towards the cafe across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cafe was warm and inviting, with soft classical music playing in the background. But Joyce&#39;s eyes were icy as she spoke. &#34;You look like you&#39;ve hit rock bottom. Let me guess-Daniela turned you down?|saw you two talking earlier. Alexander, let me give you a little reality check. Stop wasting your energy.I&#39;d bet Daniela and Cedric have been together for a while now. She&#39;s stubborn, and if you hadn&#39;t been so cruel back then, she wouldn&#39;t have turned to anyone else. But now Cedric treats her like she&#39;s priceless.She&#39;ll never leave him. Why would she, when she&#39;s got someone as exceptionaI as him? She&#39;s no fool,Alexander.She won&#39;t come back to you.&#34; Alexander raised his coffee to his lips, trying to appear composed, but his knuckles whitened as his grip on the cup tightened. &#34;So, you&#39;re just here to mock me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was always a realist. Daniela had her own success and looked at him from a higher pedestal,which, frankly, made sense. But Joyce, who had no shame about selling herself, was in no position to make fun of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scoffed. &#34;You&#39;re no better than me. Just as foolish. Do you even realize how you&#39;ve got your current life? Everyone in Olisvine sees it, but you walk around acting like you&#39;re above them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t hesitate. She shot to her feet and flung her coffee straight at Alexander.&#34;You jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wiped his cheek with a paper napkin and said, &#34;Seriously? With all your experience, you should be able to handle tis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce marched over, her hand lifted to slap Alexander, but he grabbed it with ease and then  forcefully shoved her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passerby caught the scene on camera and uploaded it online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the comments came flooding in, and they were surely brutal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are these two getting back together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither of them is worth anything. A match made in hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; heard Alexander saw Daniela before meeting up with Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave Daniela out of this! She&#39;s with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to a popular serialized novel, Daniela and Cedric had become an incredibly beloved couple among fans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, people just watched the spectacle unfold,but once Daniela&#39;s name was thrown into the mix,fans went wild, flooding Bennett Group&#39;s website in protest. This was the first time a fan protest of this scale had been directed at someone outside the entertainment industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stared at his screen in disbelief as Bennett Group&#39;s website crashed, filled with hateful messages. His anger was reaching its boiling point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time dialing Alexander. &#34;We lost five more regular clients today. Alexander, Daniela is your only lifeline. If she&#39;s willing to help, we might still have a shot.Otherwise...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard didn&#39;t need to finish the thought;Alexander understood exactly what he was implying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family had endured one setback after another and hadn&#39;t launched any significant projects in ages. If more regular clients pulledout, Bennett Group could be facing bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had never thought he&#39;d find himself in a position where he might have to beg Daniela for mercy to keep Bennett Group afloat.  Feeling defeated, Alexander made his way back to the Harper family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Katrina wasn&#39;t as welcoming as she usually was. She had seen the news and was aware of Bennett Group&#39;s situation to some degree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a detached tone, she remarked, &#34;You&#39;re doing this for yourself now, so there&#39;s no need for me to pamper you anymore, right? You know what needs to be done. If you want the money and the company,forget your pride. Get on Daniela&#39;s good side, and you&#39;ll find your way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at Katrina, whose attitude flipped faster than a page turning, and forced a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people were so incredibly pragmatic!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew exactly what needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning Daniela wasn&#39;t just about personal gain; it was the doorway to all the wealth and power in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her, he&#39;d be left with nothing but empty hands and shattered dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Alexander realized how far he&#39;d fallen. His pride, his dignity-they were long gone.From now on, he&#39;d have to beg for Daniela&#39;s favor,clinging to the hope of a second chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was self-respect worth anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Bennett Group, it was just an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family&#39;s legacy, everything they had built over generations, couldn&#39;t end like this. Not in his hands.He couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
