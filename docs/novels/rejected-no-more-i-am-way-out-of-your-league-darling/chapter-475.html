                <p>Ryan was taken aback; Cedric typically didn&#39;t drink to escape his worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always maintained that drinking clouded his judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing through Ryan&#39;s thoughts, Cedric leaned back casually in the armchair,looking downward as a soft shadow played across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan,on the other hand, had crafted an entire tragic narrative in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, I&#39;m aware of the struggles you&#39;re facing with Daniela these days. Try not to take it too personally;she means well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond but raised his glass to Ryan&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan observed him and emptied his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ryan could utter another word, Cedric grabbed the bottle and refilled Ryan&#39;s glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bottoms up,&#34; Cedric said, lifting his glass to Ryan&#39;s once more. &#34;Let&#39;s drown our sorrows.&#34; Ryan consumed another glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric filled up Ryan&#39;s glass once again, urging him to drink before he could get a word out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan continued to drink glass after glass, his vision becoming blurry,when he heard Cedric let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan,&#34; Cedric said, rotating the glass in his hand. His voice was gentle, the opposite of the loud music in the bar. He appeared burdened by unrequited love,and Ryan felt a wave of empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was about to respond when Cedric gestured for him to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan, I know. You&#39;ve always been like family to me after all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan felt a wave of unease at his words. But the alcohol clouded his thoughts, leaving him unable to think of a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued, &#34;My wife keeps her distance,claiming it&#39;s for my own good. Wouldn&#39;t that upset you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing Cedric&#39;s disheartened appearance, Ryan felt a surge of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught Ryan&#39;s sincere look and blinked,exhaling deeply. &#34;I&#39;m at a loss what to do now. Ryan,just be honest with me. Am I that untrustworthy? You know me more than anyone else. No one else understands, but vou do, right? I&#39;ve loved Daniela for over ten years. I&#39;ve valued her so deeply,and now I&#39;m at a loss. Ryan, what should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then filled Ryan&#39;s glass once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric emptied his drink, leaving Ryan no option but to do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After placing his glass down, Ryan met Cedric&#39;s expectant,curious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan shook his head, his thoughts clouded. &#34;Cedric,truly, Daniela is doing this for the best. She cares for you. I&#39;ve never seen her show such concern for anyone else as she does for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a profound sigh. &#34;Is that so? But I&#39;ve heard my family troubles her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Ryan&#39;s heart raced. Yet, the growing effects of the alcohol scrambled his thoughts. &#34;You&#39;re aware of it? Didn&#39;t Daniela ask us not to tell you? She feared it would bourden you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head, appearing distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t say more; Daniela has forbidden it. But Cedric.believe me.She won&#39;t leave you,truly.She loves you,&#34;Ryan reassured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric watched as Ryan sank into the sofaand began messing with his phone, likely calling someone for a ride.Cedric lowered his gaze, taking another sip from his glass. As Ryan glanced his way, Cedric murmured, &#34;1fear she wants to divorce me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan bolted upright at those words. &#34;No way! What makes you think that, Cedric? Daniela loves you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned back on the sofa, his face expressionless. &#34;If we end up divorcing, I might as well die. I have no family; nobody really cares about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s eyes grew wide. &#34;That&#39;s not true! Cedric, if your biological father could see how successful you are today,he would be incredibly proud. His other son has turned out to be a disappointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression hardened, his emotions in chaos.Yet,he kept his composure, appearing as if he had always known and it didn&#39;t affect him. &#34;His other son a disappointment? Not necessarily,&#34; he said casually.though he tightened his grip on the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not necessarily? Absolutely!&#34; Ryan, visibly drunk.stumbled over his words. &#34;Your older brother is really something else. If your family knew about you, they would try to exploit you. Your father and grandmother are as manipulative as Caiden. Daniela is scared of what could happen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan hiccupped. &#34;But with her by your side, you won&#39;t face harm. She&#39;s mostly worried you&#39;ll feel wronged,and currently, she suspects your family is mixed up in that issue.&#34; Cedric quickly asked, &#34;What issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan said,&#34;It&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,his face had hit the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned,pulling at Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was completely knocked out, and Cedric massaged his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could the issue be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting any more time, Cedric instructed someone to take Ryan home. He then set off for his home.</p>
