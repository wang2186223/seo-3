                <p>With rage boiling over, Caiden charged downstairs, his eyes blazing as he prepared to confront Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce reclined on the sofa, leisurely biting into a crisp,bright red apple, barely glancing his way. &#34;Dad, you&#39;re in the way! Move-I&#39;m watching the best part!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a response, Caiden strode over and turned the television off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He folded his arms and fixed a piercing stare on her,his tone brooking no defiance.&#34;Getupstairs.Rightnow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, undeterred by Caiden&#39;s authority, knew well that in this household, it was Katrina who held the reins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining calm and collected, Katrina reassured Joyce. &#34;Head upstairs, sweetheart. Everything&#39;s under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a reassuring smile, she watched Joyce ascend the stairs, clutching her doll tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home, Joyce was doted upon, and recently,her pregnancy was becoming noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina harbored concerns but kept them to herself. Given the family&#39;s wealth, she mused over the possibility of securing a live-in son-in-law. True,Joyce was pregnant,yet it would be her first marriage.Nowadays, with enough money in her pocket,what was there to even stress about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to let the Bennett family suck up to Daniela all they wanted. That fucking bitch was bound to face her downfall sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vengeful thought curled K&lt;atrina&#39;s lips into a wicked,twisted smirk that made Caiden&#39;s blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inhaled deeply before confronting her. &#34;Did you take everything from the safe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did. What about it?&#34; Katrina&#39;s response came with a dismissive shrug, her voice dripping with nonchalance. Relief had washed over her when she&#39;d earlier checked the safe; without that, she wouldn&#39;t have unearthed the fact that Brylee had left Daniela a lavish inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bounty included a colossal insurance policy and an entire island-a prime tourist hotspot whose value had likely soared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terms of the inheritance were strict, stating the island would only legally belong to Daniela after she had been married for a year. Until that milestone, any revenue the island generated was to be strictly held in trust, utterly inaccessible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina eyed the island with voracious intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing it for her daughter meant independence from any financial reliance on a partner. She envisioned a future where men would queue up, desperate to cater to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All that shit belongs to Daniela. Even some of the properties-Brylee left them for her, not you. So keep your grubby hands off,&#34; Caiden interjected, his voice steady yet assertive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even granting him a glance,Katrina countered,&#34;This house and everything in it belongs to me. Let me make one thing clear-if you dare tell Daniela,I&#39;ll divorce you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone turned icy, slicing through the air. &#34;You understand the stakes, don&#39;t you? Harper Group has been riding on Brylee&#39;s coattails for years. Should another scandal erupt, we might as well file for bankruptcy right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina reclined in the sofa, her laughter tinged with derision. &#34;Really, do you believe Brylee would be pleased,knowing you&#39;ve frittered away everything she painstakingly established? Not leaving even a penny for Daniela? She would despise you. She&#39;d rue the day she fell for a worthless man like you. And Daniela?She&#39;d sever all ties. Isn&#39;t that your greatest dread?Being forsaken in your old age, with no one to look after you? Go ahead, keep it up. You&#39;ll end up rotting alone with no one to even care when you&#39;re gone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck Caiden with surgical precision, each syllable designed to inflict maximum pain. Yet, Katrina was not through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice took on a syrupy tone, dripping with deceit.&#34;However,align yourself with me,follow my lead,and we can keep this family whole. Remember, you are Daniela&#39;s biological father. Once she marries, you could travel overseas, apply for her death certificate,and all her assets would naturally revert to you. You&#39;d be set for life, so don&#39;t act like you&#39;re the one losing out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face registered shock, his features contorting between disbelief and dread. He gaped at Katrina, his voice barely above a whisper. &#34;What the fuck did you just say? Apply for Daniela&#39;s death certificae?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wicked grin, Katrina clapped her hands together and chuckled. &#34;Oh, come on! It&#39;s just some damn paperwork-it&#39;s not like she&#39;s really going to drop dead. What&#39;s got you trembling? Listen closely,Caiden, I married you seeking a stable life. Maintain that stabilty, and I&#39;ll ensure your life remains lavish.Your fortune won&#39;t be squandered on my watch.&#34; As she spoke, Katrina sent him a coquettish look-a look that once had him utterly ensnared and distractible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Katrina&#39;s ruthless, greedy nature laid bare,Caiden&#39;s stomach churned with disgust. She was the embodiment of everything he despised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was already plotting the course of Joyce&#39;s life.She envisioned an ideal suitor for Joyce-tall, striking,burdened by neither aging kin nor any familial ties,ideally an orphan, unencumbered and free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had pledged a sizable amount of five million dollars for the suitor who satisfied these criteria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden realized where Katrina&#39;s boldness stemmed from-it was the inheritance Brylee had set aside for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, something held him back; he couldn&#39;t force himself to see Daniela about the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by shame,he couldn&#39;t bear to meet her gaze-not after all the turmoil they had endured.</p>
