                <p>Daniela entered the office early,only to be met with the sight of Alexander already settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had his workstation in Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the one overseeing Sunny Pharmaceuticals?&#34;Daniela asked,cutting straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;Yes, these are the evaluation reports and our latest financial statements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed through the papers before asking,&#34;Is Doug the real power behind all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alexander was caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true that Doug was the one funding the venture,while Alexander managed everything else, even standing as the company&#39;s legal figurehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Daniela managed to figure out Doug&#39;s role with just a cursory glance at the documents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, confident in his business acumen, was sure that only the sharpest professionals would catch any inconsistencies in the report. &#34;How did you know?&#34; Alexander blurted out, unable to hide his surprise. The words left him before he could stop them, and regret followed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to be so taken aback. We simply see things differently,&#34; Daniela replied, her voice even and measured. &#34;I&#39;ll go over the collaboration plan when l can. For now, you can return and wait for the update.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the exchange, Daniela&#39;s professionalism remained unwavering, her expression devoid of any warmth beyond the formality of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left a hollow feeling in Alexander, a sting that lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he quickly shook it off. The partnership was essential, and there was no room for errors. He understood that regaining a woman&#39;s heart required more than just effort-it demanded a calculated approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a respectful nod, he stood up. His voice gentle,he said to Daniela, &#34;I&#39;ll be on my way,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intimacy in his tone was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been absorbed in his laptop across the room, noticed it and slowly looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes met, and Alexander asked, &#34;Mr. Phillips,may I have a moment of your time?&#34; Ledric and Alexander left Daniela&#39;s office and paused t the end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jina observed the two men from a distance,her eyes arrowing thoughtfully. She turned to Natalie and ausked, &#34;Alexander seems to have his act together. Do ou think we should consider bringing him onto our teide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze deepened as she pondered for a moment, then said, &#34;Let&#39;s wait and see what unfolds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>leanwhile, at the other end of the hallway,Alexander ixed his eyes on Cedric&#39;s handsome features,bathed the glow of the lights. With a mocking grin,he neered, &#34;Don&#39;t get too comfortable, Cedric. Just ecause you&#39;re in a good spot now doesn&#39;t mean 2ou&#39;ve won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ji-edric gave a dismissive snort. &#34;What do you mean by at? I don&#39;t even see you as an opponent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>z ene words hit Alexander like a blow, igniting his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>10 eoon&#39;t get too cocky. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s been loved ,Daniela for ten years. I won&#39;t back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>6W</p>
                
                
                
                <p>edric&#39;s look at Alexander was one of utter disdain, as oadihe were staring at something worthless. &#34;You&#39;re still ole knging to that? Do you really think you&#39;ve got a ance? You&#39;re fooling yourself.Daniela has standards.id you&#39;re too tainted-better suited for someone like Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Joyce made Alexander&#39;s blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stung like an open wound, a reminder of the shame he couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, uninterested in dragging things out, turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he stepped away, Alexander&#39;s voice rang out, laced with a chilling edge. &#34;Don&#39;t wear her out too much in bed, Cedric. Daniela&#39;s not as strong as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric halted in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold glance flickered across his face. He had no intention of sharing details of his private life with anyone other than Daniela, especially not with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I don&#39;t care to discuss my private life. But just so you know, if I wanted to, I could wipe Sunny Pharmaceuticals off the map without breaking a sweat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Alexander like a punch. His face shifted from arrogance to shock. &#34;I dare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile was almost imperceptible, a flicker of amusement. &#34;You really want to test me?&#34; Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel,hands casually stuffed into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave Daniela the proposal in the morning,but Sunny Pharmaceuticals went bankrupt in the afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news reached Daniela soon after, and she was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she asked, &#34;What exactly did he do to set you off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was direct. &#34;He was after you. And besides, if 1didn&#39;t step in, it seemed like he forgot who runs the game in Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her expression unreadable, before discarding the proposal Alexander had handed her into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To anyone watching, Cedric might&#39;ve seemed unshakable, but inside, he was tense. The lack of anger from Daniela gave him some relief, and he exhaled,the weight easing off his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of satisfaction, he managed to obliterate several of Bennett Group&#39;s latest projects, all before the day was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric prepared to head downstairs to receive a parcel, Alexander appeared at the door. Without knocking, he stormed in. &#34;Cedric Phillips,don&#39;t you know how to show some grace after a win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t even flinch, his face unreadable. After all,he was the untouchable CEO, the one everyone in Olisvine feared. &#34;I don&#39;t bother with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger bubbled up in Alexander&#39;s chest. &#34;You&#39;re worried, aren&#39;t you? Afraid that I&#39;ll become a real threat and take your spot next to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; Cedric chuckled lightly, amusement flickering in his eyes. &#34;If you becoming a real competitor could challenge my spot, I&#39;d focus more on market trends to make sure you never get that chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury blazed in Alexander&#39;s eyes, but Cedric remained unfazed, strolling upstairs without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator ascended, Lillian couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;Cedric, your jealousy is something else. With the way you&#39;ve handled things, no other man in Olisvine would dare make a move on Daniela. You could bankrupt someone in the blink of an eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Lillian pressed further, asking, &#34;Does Daniela know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight smirk tugged at Cedric&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;ve done it with her full consent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had once told him that in the rest of her life,it would only be him. In matters of love, she would indulge him, no matter what chaos he might stir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian wasted no time, quickly passing on their conversation to Daniela, who was immersed in reviewing a new international proposal for a company at the time.</p>
