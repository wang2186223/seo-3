                <p>In a quiet corner of the Elite Lux building, a conversation unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Katrina&#39;s gone off the deep end. What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice echoed from the shadows, cold and distant. &#34;The pawn has served its purpose. Get rid of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation ended as quickly as it began, leaving behind a faint pile of ash, untouched by the breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian took a step forward, her gaze sharpening as she dialed Daniela. &#34;They&#39;re getting ready to make their move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina waited restlessly, her nerves fraying as she anticipated the funds to come through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beforehand, she went to visit Joyce. &#34;Joyce, I&#39;m pulling together the money. Get ready to leave-l&#39;ll come for you soon. I don&#39;t care about anything else anymore; I just want you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sat across from Katrina, her face a mask of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cigarette delicately balanced between her fingers, she said, &#34;I don&#39;t need your help. I&#39;m perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s frustration bubbled over. &#34;Fine? You call this fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning light filtered down, casting a soft glow on Joyce&#39;s hollowed cheeks. She smoked with the ease of someone who had done it countless times, taking a deep drag that made her cheeks sink further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No longer the proud heiress of the Harper family, she now seemed like a socialite adrift in a life of indulgence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart. ached as she whispered, &#34;I regret everything. If I&#39;d known this would happen to you,l would&#39;ve taken the hit myself.&#34; Joyce had no interest in listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She savored the thrill of being praised. In the Harper family, Daniela&#39;s brilliance always outshone hers, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t seem to catch anyone&#39;s eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Doug, things weren&#39;t the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug might have been cruel, but he was generous. To the world, she was his wife. Sure, people might mock her behind her back, but in her presence, they had no choice but to smile and bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the admiration was superficial, Joyce still thrived on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did Daniela&#39;s achievements matter now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had everything she needed-a life of luxury, entirely on her own terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone as proud as Alexander had no choice but to bow down to her, and that made her feel like it was all worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina just couldn&#39;t grasp it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m happy with my life now. If you&#39;ve got nothing more to say, don&#39;t come looking for me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared at Joyce in shock.&#34;All my efforts... Do you know who they were for? I even went so far as to...Do you have any idea how much I&#39;ve sacrificed for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina spoke with all the sincerity she could muster, but Joyce didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had become like a pampered pet in a golden cage, with her instincts dulled and her ability to survive on her own forgotten. All that remained was her vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, please listen. Soon, I&#39;ll have a lot of money. Come with me. We&#39;ll leave and start over somewhere far away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Joyce&#39;s phone buzzed in her pocket. She checked it quickly before standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, I don&#39;t need it. Doug woke up and wants to see me. Don&#39;t bother looking for me again.I&#39;m doing just fine.&#34; Without another word, Joyce turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stood frozen, her heart aching as she watched her leave, tears silently trailing down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sudden burst of desperation, Katrina grabbed something from her bag and rushed towards Joyce,wrapping her arms around her tightly. Joyce frowned, but before she could pull away, Katrina slipped a USB drive into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, I regret it. If I had known this is how it would turn out, I never would&#39;ve married Caiden, never would&#39;ve crossed Daniela. I would&#39;ve chosen a simple life with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shoved Katrina aside, giving her a long look before leaving quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look back, so she didn&#39;t see the regret in Katrina&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached home, her phone rang once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the screen and saw a mnessage from Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Bennett family is short eight million because of the economic crisis. Can you help again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smirked. If she was Doug&#39;s trapped pet, only good for pleasing him, then Alexander was slowly but surely heading into her trap too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Joyce sent Alexander a room number, deleted the chat, and walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as Doug flew overseas, Joyce, too lazy to go out, sent an invitation to Alexander to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander stepped in, he saw Joyce sprawled on the sofa, nearly naked, her body covered only by a sheer scarf that barely served a purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wrists had marks from restraints, which made him pause in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned instantly and asked, &#34;Are you out of your mind? Inviting me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined Joyce would be so audacious. Joyce giggled, the foul stench from her mouth unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care. Grabbing a glass of water, she downed it along with the disgusting fluid without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood off to the side, watching the entire scene unfold, his stomach twisting with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he couldn&#39;t hold it anymore and rushed to the bathroom, vomiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce listened to Alexander gagging in the bathroom, and her expression grew more distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as he came out, the coldness in her eyes melted away, replaced by amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, what&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brow furrowed as he prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce didn&#39;t stop him; instead, she lighted a scented candle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned back, she saw him standing by the door, unsure whether to stay or go, and couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you leaving? Is it because you haven&#39;t gotten the money yet? Seems like your pride isn&#39;t worth much. If you actually left, I might even admire you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood stiffly, feeling torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce leaned back on the sofa, her voice soft but commanding. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was like someone calling a pet to come.</p>
