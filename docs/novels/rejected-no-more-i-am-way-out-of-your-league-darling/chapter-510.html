                <p>Joyce said, &#34;Our family has long been rooted in mining. With Doug&#39;s passing, the business has grown beyond my capacity to manage alone. As we&#39;re half-sisters and I prefer to keep the business in the family,I&#39;m proposing we become partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, she exuded a sense ofpride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had evolved significantly from her earlier days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint smile and replied, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce said with a nod, &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, remaining silent, rose and approached the coffee table to pour herself a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce watched Daniela, a look of confusion spreading across her face. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s your hesitation? I&#39;m here offering a partnership that includes significant financial benefits. Why not accept immediately? Are you aware of how profitable our mines are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured with her fingers, indicating a figure. &#34;This much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sipped her coffee quietly, her smile slight. She disregarded the figures Joyce suggested, familiar with the financial details of major corporations, including those based in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her leadership at Elite Lux was no coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew of Doug&#39;s reputation as a financial powerhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela maintained her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression turned to one of frustration.11|get that you&#39;re wealthy, Daniela, but more wealth never hurts. This is an exceptional chance. I&#39;m offering this because I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile persisted. Joyce always felt a twinge of annoyance at Daniela&#39;s grin. It was as if Daniela knew everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You trust me...&#34; Daniela began with a smile. &#34;Alexander&#39;s father visited me recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, noting Joyce&#39;s reaction. &#34;He was upset, mentioned you wouldn&#39;t see him, and that Alexander has gone missing. He&#39;s quite concerned and asked if I could help locate his son, given our past connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce narrowed her eyes slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela added, &#34;I&#39;ve agreed to help. Now that you&#39;re here, perhaps you might know something. Where could Alexander have gone? It&#39;s unusual for a person to just disappear. Those in the know are aware he&#39;s missing,but outsiders might suspect he&#39;s up to something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes darted away. &#34;I haven&#39;t kept up with him. He never valued my presence much, and I&#39;d rather not be entangled with his issues now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s pulse quickened under Daniela&#39;s perceptive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to maintain composure, she said, &#34;Daniela, let&#39;s not get sidetracked. I need to know if you&#39;re in on the partnership. If you&#39;re not interested, I&#39;ll look elsewhere. Many would jump at the chance to collaborate with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a mild smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed Joyce&#39;s eyes darting towards Cedric as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression became thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suurprised her that after all this time, Joyce still seemed infatuated with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you find it appealing?&#34; Daniela suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Joyce hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she thought Daniela had actually noticed something. But after a brief pause, Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the silence. &#34;I was talking about the flowers in Cedric&#39;s hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s workspace was typically stark and formal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet today, it was adorned with various blooms, lending an intriguing air to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not bad,&#34; Joyce commented, redirecting her attention away from Cedric. &#34;I&#39;ll give you three days to think it over. If I don&#39;t hear from you by then, I&#39;Il seek another partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that declaration, she rose to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on Cedric once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela engrossed in her coffee, Joyce hesitated. She then approached Cedric and asked, &#34;Where did you get those flowers? They&#39;re beautifully arranged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While arranging the flowers, Cedric responded, &#34;I can send you the shop&#39;s details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked back at Daniela, now absorbed in her phone, and bit her lip. &#34;Cedric, perhaps you could get some for me as well? I&#39;ll pay you handsomely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced up at Joyce, somewhat bewildered. &#34;With all your resources, surely you can find someone else for this task. I don&#39;t require any compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shade of annoyance crossed Joyce&#39;s face. She pointed at some flowers Cedric had set aside. &#34;May I take them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had no objections. Those were destined for the trash anyway. His attention was fully on arranging the blossoms to make them look even more perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Cedric agreed, focusing on his task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, slightly embarrassed,reached for the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought of them as a gift from Cedric.</p>
