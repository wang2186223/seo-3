                <p>Weddings in high society were often seen as more than just celebrations. They were opportunities to make valuable connections. Joyce&#39;s wedding was no different. The grand hall was filled with influential figures from Olisvine&#39;s business circles, all eagerly awaiting the arrival of Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests craned their necks, glancing towards the entrance in anticipation. But as the wedding drew to a close, Daniela was still nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of discontent began to circulate among the guests. Finally, one man approached Caiden, his tone sharp. &#34;Ms. Harper isn&#39;t coming, is she? You promised she would be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding had attracted all the big players from Olisvine&#39;s business world. Even a hardware mogul,still recovering from a broken leg, had managed to hobble in with an extravagant gift.But why? They had come for Daniela. Not for Caiden.Not for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was fully aware of this. Yet, to help Alexander build connections, he had shamelessly used Daniela&#39;s name to attract the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, Caiden responded, &#34;Of course,she&#39;ll be here. Daniela is always so dedicated to her work that she&#39;s probably caught up with something.In the meantime, if there&#39;s anything you need to discuss, you can always talk to Alexander. It&#39;s pretty much the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He motioned for Alexander to come over. The young man approached with a wine glass in hand. Caiden gestured toward the guest and introduced him.&#34;Alexander, this is one of the top export distributors in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander offered a polite smile and raised his glass in greeting. But the guest&#39;s expression instantly hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guest refused to clink glasses with Alexander,cutting straight to the heart of the matter. &#34;Mr.Harper,this is unacceptable. Using your daughter&#39;s wedding to boost your son-in-law&#39;s status is one thing,but claiming Daniela would attend when she&#39;s not here? That crosses the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another guest, who had been quietly watching from the sidelines, stepped forward. &#34;Exactly. We&#39;re not here for the wedding-we came to meet Daniela. The gifts we brought weren&#39;t for Joyce; they were investments in forging a connection with Daniela.If this was just any wedding, I would&#39;ve shown up with a thousand bucks. But instead, I brought a priceless antique. If Daniela doesn&#39;t show up, you&#39;d better return it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs in the crowd grew louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34; someone chimed in from the gathering crowd. &#34;Isn&#39;t this straight-up deception? Everyone knows the Harper family doesn&#39;t get along with Daniela. Before I came, I asked multiple times if she&#39;d be here, and you assured me she would. You said she&#39;s family and wouldn&#39;t miss her sister&#39;s wedding. So where is she? Where is Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face turned red with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had warned Katrina that this plan was bound to fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were people who couldn&#39;t be easily fooled. If Daniela didn&#39;t appear, there was no chance they would simply let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina had brushed off his worries, saying,&#34;They&#39;ve already brought the gifts. Do you really think they&#39;ll take them back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden wanted to retort, &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t they?&#34; A thousand-dollar gift was one thing,but a priceless antique worth millions was another. Did Katrina think they brought these gifts for Joyce out of generosity?No, they were here for Daniela. Now, realizing that Daniela&#39;s bond with them had become so strained that she wouldn&#39;t even show up to the wedding,how could they possibly accept this without protest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the growing chaos, Katrina rushed over to Caiden, leaning in close. &#34;Call Daniela. Now!&#34; she whispered urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What should have been a joyous celebration was quickly turning into a public spectacle, all due to Katrina&#39;s insatiable greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexander and his father sat with blank expressions, clearly humiliated. They had never felt so ashamed. The Bennett family&#39;s relatives around them kept their heads down, whispering quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander was meant to be the pride of the Bennett family. How did he end up marrying someone like her?&#34; one of them muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows? She&#39;s nowhere near as impressive as Daniela. Joyce looks like trouble-mark my words,the Bennett family will regret this in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a disgrace. Should we leave now? We&#39;re all businesspeople. Imagine the fallout if word gets out that the Bennett family used deceit to collect expensive gifts. Who would trust us then?&#34; The relatives shared looks of agreement before quietly slipoping out through the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching this, the Harper family&#39;s relatives did the same,quickly leaving the wedding in large numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time two-thirds of the event had passed, the majority of both the Harper and Bennett families&#39;relatives had already left. The tables in front of the stage now stood eerily empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hadn&#39;t expected things to spiral so badly.Even reporters had arrived to cover the unfolding chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his panic, he rushed to the hallway, desperate to reach Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his calls were met with silence-his number had been blocked. Growing more desperate, he flagged down a passing waiter and borrowed his phone.Dialing again, he held his breath as the phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rings, the call finally connected. Daniela&#39;s voice came through the line, sharp and clear. &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Caiden couldn&#39;t find the words. The silence stretched on until he felt Daniela&#39;s growing impatience. He swallowed his hesitation, forcing a stiff &#34;Hello&#34; from his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Daniela replied, her tone cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden finally managed to ask, &#34;Can you come to your sister&#39;s wedding?&#34;</p>
