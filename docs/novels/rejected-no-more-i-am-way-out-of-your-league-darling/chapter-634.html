                <p>Alexander stood apart from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat on a mountain of wealth, over five billion to his name. Spending a couple million? That was just a piece of cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyebrows knitted together subtly, her expression barely changing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer, however, was elated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thirty million on the table! Mr. Phillips is raising the stakes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Alexander with a hopeful glimmer in his eyes. &#34;Mr. Bennett, would you care to increase your offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was noticeably annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was merely a small bowl. Blowing a few millions for Daniela&#39;s sake was still within reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But more than ten millions for its acquisition? That seemed ludicrous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his deep pockets, reckless spending wasn&#39;t really his thing. Was Cedric losing his senses?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was notably shrewd about value for money.as a businessman, he lived by the pursuit of profit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his lips and cast a quick glance at Daniela, who appeared completely disinterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander considered raising his bid one final time,ready to concede if outbid. After all, it was just a small bowl. If Daniela truly desired it,he could always arrange another purchase later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just an ordinary piece-nothing to get worked up over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could tell that Cedric was fiercely determined to claim victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, he aimed to make the victory less straightforward for Cedric. With a deliberate edge to his actions, Alexander lifted his paddle high and declared a steep bid. &#34;Forty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes twinkling with mischief, Alexander watched Cedric intently, curious to see how he would respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forty million for just a bowl? Outrageous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Cedric was poised to bid again. However, as the room&#39;s attention shifted towards him, a distinct &#34;tsk&#34; cut through the silence. Turning sharply. Cedric&#39;s eyes met Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was frosty, revealing nothing of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, there was an undeniable message in her eyes that made Cedric slowly lower his paddle back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a cold and detached tone, he declared, &#34;I&#39;ve changed my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer quickly took advantage of the moment. &#34;Very well. Forty million once, forty million twice, and sold for forty million thrice!Congratulations to Mr. Bennett for acquiring this exquisite antique. Mr. Bennett, your patronage is greatly valued.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the auctioneer showered him with thanks,Alexander felt a sharp sting of regret sinking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forty million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had impulsively dropped forty million for this insignificant piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was completely unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s knees quivered, yet he managed to uphold a facade that screamed, &#34;I&#39;m affluent; I believe it&#39;s worthwhile.&#34; Rising to his feet  he no e&#39;ed a rigid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught sight of this and erupted into laughte heartily slapping his thigh. &#34;Idiot! What a damn fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Alexander felt a pang of foolishness wash over him, flushing with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when he caught Daniela&#39;s subtle smile, he was caught off guard, momentarily spellbound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela radiated an enchanting beauty, her vibrant allure somewhat dimmed, now overshadowed by an aristocratic detachment that captivated all who looked her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the auction concluded, Alexander directed his driver to gather the remaining items and personally handed the small bowl to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, a figure lurked, snapping photographs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression was frosty as she said, &#34;It appears my earlier remarks fell on deaf ears, huh? Did you really think you could just hitch a ride on my success?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scrambled to justify himself. &#34;Not at all. I merely wanted to purchase a gift that would bring you joy. Was it not to your liking? I knew handing you money wouldn&#39;t sway you, so l opted to convey my Rising to his feet  he no e&#39;ed a rigid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught sight of this and erupted into laughte heartily slapping his thigh. &#34;Idiot! What a damn fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Alexander felt a pang of foolishness wash over him, flushing with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when he caught Daniela&#39;s subtle smile, he was caught off guard, momentarily spellbound.</p>

                <p>From a distance, a figure lurked, snapping photographs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression was frosty as she said, &#34;It appears my earlier remarks fell on deaf ears, huh? Did you really think you could just hitch a ride on my success?&#34;</p>

I knew handing you money wouldn&#39;t sway you, so l opted to convey my sentiments through this gesture. Please, don&#39;t look upon it with disdain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander handed over the staggering sum of forty million, his expression betrayed none of elation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Though this bowl may not hold such value, it seems perfect for you. I&#39;m prepared to pay any price.Daniela,to me, our connection is beyond value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, her gaze drifting to the small bowl placed before her. &#34;Really? You&#39;re actually giving this to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation,Alexander confirmed.&#34;Absolutely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a graceful motion, Daniela accepted the bowl and gestured to the figure who lingered at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journalist approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s yours,&#34; Daniela declared, passing the small bowl to the journalist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journalist was clearly startled. &#34;What?&#34; A staggering forty million was tied to this one small bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s yours,&#34; Daniela affirmed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander opened his mouth to interject, Daniela preempted him, addressing the journalist. &#34;No need for thanks. Direct your gratitude towards Mr. Bennett He was just pondering whether this bowl would suit you. I believe it complements your style impeccably.Isn&#39;t that right, Mr. Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clenched teeth, Alexander managed a strained smile.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile held a trace of scorn as she slipped into her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the story of a man who spent forty million on a bowl only to hand it off to a journalist caught fire across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became the butt of countless jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander truly made a fool of himself, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could argue with that? He made quite the spectacle in his attempts to win Daniela back, yet it turned out to be a mess of his own creation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is still married, not yet divorced. Does &#39;Alexander have nosense of decency?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely! It&#39;s absolutely disgraceful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s clear Daniela harbors no feelings for Alexander.Had she cared, she surely wouldn&#39;t have entrusted that bowl to another.Alexander must cease this futile pursuit; can&#39;t he perceive the annoyance etched on Daniela&#39;s face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on! I remember watching a video where Alexander was being downright haughty towards Cedric right at the entrance of the auction hall. Could Daniela be taking a stand for Cedric by her actions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those controversial topics were scrubbed from the internet in under thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the following day, the stock price of Bennett Group plummeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A partnership, poised on the brink of success, was suddenly retracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett Group&#39;s fortunes reversed in less than a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The business world once more observed the subtlety of Daniela&#39;s strategies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a simple maneuver, she reclaimed all the benefits Alexander had gained by riding on Daniela&#39;s Ccoattails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henceforth, everyone acknowledged an undeniable truth-at at Daniela&#39;s signal, fortunes could skyrocket to the heavens. However, if she frowned, a downfall could ensue by dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plagued with anxiety, Alexander found himself</p>
