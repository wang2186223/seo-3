                <p>Brad spoke through clenched teeth. &#34;I didn&#39;t plan for any of this, but Ethan found out what we were doing.He threatened to tell Daniela. I had no other choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the villa, rain began pouring hard against the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared at the storm for a moment. Then he lowered his voice. &#34;Josh, don&#39;t turn your back on me now.I need you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened his shoulders and took a deep breath.His voice turned sharp, with a cold edge. &#34;If anything happens to me,you&#39;ll be dragged down too. You know how Daniela is. She won&#39;t let you off. Didn&#39;t you say that if Daniela dies, Oiscoll will end up in the McCoy family&#39;s hands? I did what had to be done. You told me the family comes first. I followed that. We&#39;re in this together now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh didn&#39;t answer right away. He sat quietly, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the wall. &#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; he finally said. &#34;But you need to deal with Ethan&#39;s body fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then send someone for me,&#34; said Brad. &#34;I&#39;ll pack the body into a suitcase and sneak it out tonight. By tomorrow, Daniela will be gone, and no one will know a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll arrange a pickup at one in the morning,&#34; Josh replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted in his seat and looked over at Jules, who was sprawled on the couch with a game controller in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules didn&#39;t look away from the screen. &#34;What did Brad want? Why were you on the phone that long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh turned to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain hit harder now. The TV in the background reported a strong storm with powerful winds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some trees on the road had already snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brad said his car broke down,&#34; Josh answered casually. &#34;He needs a lift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded. &#34;Tomorrow&#39;s when Daniela&#39;s supposed to die, right? It&#39;s good for him to come back, to avoid any slip-ups over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules had no idea what was really going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh kept his gaze on the rain sliding down the window.He muttered under his breath, &#34;Yes, to prevent any slip-ups. We&#39;re family, aren&#39;t we? l&#39;ve always cared about you the most, Brad. Now it&#39;s your turn to care about me.&#34;Once he&#39;d said that, he stepped out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, he quietly told the secretary, &#34;Have the new driver take the off-road vehicle parked outside and pick up Brad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary blinked, caught off guard. &#34;Isn&#39;t that vehicle reserved for Daniela? Why...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was they using it to pick up Brad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave her a hard smile. &#34;Brad needs it more.Only the dead know how to keep their mouths shut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan had already been silenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad was next in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela gone and Cedric too broken to lead,Josh thought Oiscoll would soon fall into his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night pressed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood by the tall window. At exactly 1 A.M.,Brad loaded a heavy suitcase into the black off-road vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Carol and said, &#34;The bomb will go off in an hour. Five minutes before that, push the vehicle over the cliff. Make it look like an accident. Keep Brad alive and hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a simple nod. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the house, not a sound stirred. Daniela stood quietly, one hand resting over her stomach, her loose robe brushing against her ankles.&#34;Babies, this time, I&#39;ll keep you safe,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and gave him a soft smile. He leaned in to kiss her, the steady rain drumming outside their window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed, and eventually, Daniela curled into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said softly, &#34;Once everything&#39;s settled, we&#39;ll leave Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Cedric, this place had become heavy with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too much noise. Too many schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela murmured, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cedric asked, &#34;And Carol? What do we do about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked over at Nikolas. He stood at the villa&#39;s entrance holding an umbrella, unaware that Carol had already slipped out through the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them figure things out on their own,&#34; she said. &#34;If Nikolas is serious, they&#39;ll make it work. What matters is no one hurts people around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nothing if not fiercely protective. Cedric gave a nod. &#34;When this is all done, let&#39;s go back to Olisvine. The air&#39;s clean, and everything from hospitals to schools is better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as Daniela walked downstairs,she noticed the housekeeper&#39;s uneasy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, there&#39;s been an incident,&#34; the housekeeper said with shaky urgency.&#34;The news said Brad drove off a cliff last night. The car exploded.There was nothing left. The entire thing looked awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper lifted her eyes, waiting for a reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded and asked, &#34;Has breakfast been set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper stared, confused, then repeated herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone didn&#39;t change. &#34;I heard you. Now, is it ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper nodded slowly. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat down to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric came downstairs, she repeated the news again. He simply nodded, colder than before, and began to squeeze juice for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Carol shuffled in, yawning. The housekeeper gave her the same report. Carol nodded, dropped onto the couch, and flipped on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expecting her to tuurn to the news, the housekeeper watched.Instead,Carol chose a horror film and leaned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit her. Their hearts were like ice.Brad had lived under their roof for a few days. Cedric even belonged to the McCoy family. So why were they all acting like nothing had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Hamilton stormed in, just as expected.His face was pale. His voice shook. &#34;Did you see it?Something&#39;s happened to Brad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the housekeeper felt she wasn&#39;t alone. Maybe she wasn&#39;t overreacting after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood there panting, as though he&#39;d run all the way in. His eyes landed on Daniela. First, he looked startled.Then,his gaze turned sharp.&#34;Was it you?&#34; he asked.</p>
