                <p>Daniela entered the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes lit up when she saw Daniela, almost as if she were looking at someone who could save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she knew that asking help for Daniela would be futile. Daniela would never agree to go with her to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurriedly, she approached Daniela and said with urgency, &#34;Daniela, Cedric&#39;s in the hospital! He called and said you need to come right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a chance to protest, she pushed Daniela out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the driver sped through the streets, Daniela narrowed her eyes at Katrina, her gaze so cold it felt like it could freeze the very air between them. &#34;Say that again,&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina could sense Daniela&#39;s presence growing more formidable, and she began to feel a twinge of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervously laughing, Katrina added, &#34;Well, Joyce got into trouble, and there&#39;s no one else who can deal with it. Please, I&#39;m begging you; come with me to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the car pulled up at the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina practically dragged Daniela towards the hospital, her urgency clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela pulled her hand away sharply, walking inside on her own without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hurried after her. &#34;I knew you still think of us as family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a smirk, but her tone quickly turned serious. &#34;If this happens again, the consequences will affect Joyce&#39;s financial interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face drained of color at her words. She understood that Daniela was talking about the five percent stake in the robotics company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t happen again. Thanks for coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to thank me. I just want to see how the things you fought so hard to steal are now leading to your downfal,&#34; Danlela replied, her tone biting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both then made their way into the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From down the corridor, Joyce&#39;s angry voice echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood quietly to one side, his hand wrapped in a bandage from a recent injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police were trying to mediate, and as they drew closer, the first thing they heard was an officer&#39;s defeated remark. &#34;If this doesn&#39;t resolve, file a lawsuit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hurried forward with a nervous grin.&#34;It&#39;s just a family dispute, nothing serious,&#34; she said, trying to defuse the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela showed no interest in sticking around. Her attention was focused on responding to Cedric&#39;s messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she sent the message, Joyce&#39;s sharp voice cut through, coldly demanding of Alexander,&#34;Where are you looking with those eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Alexander truly grasped the vast differences between people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first marriage had been with Daniela, who had divorced him with courage and clarity, walking away with nothing but offering them both a dignified exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had led him to believe that divorce could be a dignified solution when a marriage fell apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Joyce,.everything was different. He found himself struggling to adjust to her domineering nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why hadn&#39;t he divorced Joyce yet? Because he knew that, this time, there would be no dignity in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was not a woman of grace-she wielded her crude power to crush everything around her,leaving no room for honor or respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Joyce&#39;s world, the idea of losing simply didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in the hospital corridor, heavy with the smell of disinfectant, Alexander gazed at Daniela&#39;s luminous profile from a distance, regretting his rash decision to divorce her for the thousandth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was escorted away,being led to a quieter space to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the situation was boring, Daniela was about to leave when Alexander approached her. &#34;I&#39;m sorry you had to be part of this awkward situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His demeanor had changed dramatically, but Daniela didn&#39;t care to explore it and had no interest in engaging. She gave a slight nod before turning to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood still with a conflicted expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, eager to smooth things over, quickly caught up with her, a chuckle slipping from his lips. &#34;Daniela,let me walk you out. I apologize for you having to witness all this mess today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator, Richard flashed a smile and leaned in.&#34;We&#39;ve known each other a long time, Daniela, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point. I was wondering if your robotics company is still accepting investments.I have some funds and was thinking of contributing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made her way to the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s car was parked and waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained silent, yet Richard persisted in following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to get into the car, Richard, unwilling to let go, called out to her. &#34;Daniela, we wronged you in the past, but that&#39;s all behind us now. Marrying someone like Joyce, well, that&#39;s Alexander&#39;s karma. Please don&#39;t hold that against us. I don&#39;t have grand ambitions; I just want to dip my toes into a small investment. A million would barely make a dent for me. Can you allow me to be involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze toward Richard. After a brief pause, she finally responded, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that sometimes, to earn, you had to invest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have someone reach out to you soon. Make sure you&#39;re ready with the funds,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was over the moon at her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never saw this stroke of fortune coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so thrilled, his excitement almost spilling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, a part of him regretted not asking for more earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A million? That was small change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, practically bubbling with excitement, could hardly contain himself as he rushed upstairs to tell Alexander the good news. &#34;Daniela agreed. She&#39;s letting me invest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, taken aback by the unexpected turn of events, was even more surprised than Richard had been.</p>
