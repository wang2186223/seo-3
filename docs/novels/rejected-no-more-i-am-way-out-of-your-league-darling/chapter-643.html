                <p>The following day, Daniela had an important meeting lined up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was to head to her previous villa once work wrapped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the meeting could properly start, her secretary stepped in, looking uneasy.&#34;Ms. Harper,there&#39;s a child downstairs insisting he&#39;s here to see his aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned in confusion. &#34;I don&#39;t have a nephew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hesitated, biting her lip. &#34;He says his name is Jack Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression hardened. She hadn&#39;t even made a move towards them yet, and already they were pushing their way into her world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary went on, &#34;For some reason, the child just dropped to his knees at the entrance.He wouldn&#39;t step inside when invited, wouldn&#39;t budge when told to leave-just stayed there sobbing, chanting your name.The press caught wind of it, and now they&#39;re swarming the place, cameras flashing non-stop. A crowd has gathered, saying the boy was innocent and branding you as cold-hearted. They&#39;re whispering that since you can&#39;t have children, this boy is meant to be your future caretaker. They&#39;re questioning how you can be so harsh just because you have some money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s fists clenched in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those people were taking advantage of Daniela&#39;s situation, pushing their luck too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was infuriating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration burned in the secretary&#39;s eyes, making them glossy with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unfazed. &#34;If they want a performance, let them put on their little play.We have business to handle-let&#39;s carry on with the meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Jack knelt on the cold pavement, his small frame weighed down by an old, oversized backpack -deliberately chosen to look pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The backpack was so ragged, the spines of battered books peeked through the torn fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The six-year-old boy hunched over, sobbing, his little shoulders shaking with each exaggerated sniffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers, their hearts softening, offered snacks and reached out to help him up. But Jack ignored them all, burying his face deeper and letting his sobs grow louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fat tears rolled down his cheeks as he whimpered over and over, &#34;I want Aunt Daniela! I need my aunt!Aunt Daniela, I&#39;m Jack-your nephew!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he came, his grandfather and mother had drilled into him the importance of patience-he had to keep his true nature under wraps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No tantrums, no spitting, no outbursts-he had to play the part perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to look helpless, pitiful-just enough to stir sympathy in the hearts of onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way,they could squeeze Daniela into footing the bill for his costly private education.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack couldn&#39;t grasp why schooling even mattered when that massive company would belong to him one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his mother had made it clear that Daniela was rich,and their family planned to thrive off her fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack found that logic sound enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was exhausted. His fake sobs had drained him,and he glanced to the company&#39;s elevator. Where was that woman, Daniela? Why hadn&#39;t she shown up yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knees throbbed, numb from kneeling for so long</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scanned the crowd and locked eyes with a woman wrapped in a scarf. She sent him a silent signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood the message. She meant, &#34;Sweetheart don&#39;t stand up! Cry louder! Even louder! People will definitely sympathize with you because you&#39;re just a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack forced his voice to crack, releasing a high-pitched wail. No tears, just noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,watching from the side, smirked in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public pressure was their weapon, their ticket to an easy life at Daniela&#39;s expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t have kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect. That meant she could raise Jack instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Joyce regret not popping out a few more kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack kept up the act, howling until his energy ran dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a pleading look at Joyce, but she clenche her fists, silently ordering him to stay down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, his round face glistening with sweat, baked under the relentless sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the tears were real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed for the cool embrace of the villa&#39;s air conditioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Jack?&#34; A man stepped up, offering a business card. &#34;I&#39;m the principal of Hope Academy.Take this to your mother. If your family is truly in financial trouble and unable to pay for school,she can reach out to me-I&#39;ll make sure your tuition is covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack narrowed his already tiny eyes, scrutinizing the man. &#34;Hope Academy? What a boring name.Is it even a private school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal blinked in surprise before shaking his head. &#34;No, but Ms. Harper has funded this school to support children who can&#39;t afford an education.Enrolling in Hope Academy would be as if your aunt was personally giving you a helping hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug grin stretched across Jack&#39;s round face.&#34;You&#39;ve got to be joking, old man! I&#39;m Jack Harper,the rightful heir to Elite Lux. Who do you think you&#39;re fooling? You&#39;re telling me my aunt donated money to your school? Did she bother asking me first? That&#39;s my money, and I won&#39;t have it wasted on a bunch of nobodies. Hand back every last penny!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack had been spoiled into greed from the start.and at his age, he didn&#39;t even know how to mask it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal stared at him, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack let out an exaggerated sigh and rolled his eyes &#34;Get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Hey! Where are your manners, kid? I&#39;m offering you an opportunity,and you throw insults? Who exactly are you calling poor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clicked her tongue in irritation,pushed through the crowd, and jabbed a finger at the principal&#39;s face.&#34;You! Yes, you! My son&#39;s just telling it like it is. You people are broke! Can&#39;t make money, can&#39;t improve your lives, but you sure know how to leech off the Harper family&#39;s fortune. And you, Mr. Principal, acting all self-righteous about education. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re not pocketing a little extra on the side! Did you skim off the donations my family gave to Hope Academy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal&#39;s face darkened with outrage at her accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smirked, tilting her chin up. &#34;Listen closely. One day,Elite Lux will be Jack&#39;s. So don&#39;t even dream of  taking advantage.&#34;</p>
