                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice carried a steadfast resolve, unwavering in its intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gazed at Daniela, his eyes filled with the same intensity as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her eyes, unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her to grasp the depth of his determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed, ready to snap back with something biting, but as the words were about to leave her lips, she realized she couldn&#39;t bring herself to speak them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sincerity made it impossible for her to respond with anything but softness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s discuss it tomorrow,&#34; Daniela replied, her gaze betraying a fleeting moment of vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips curled into a knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela began to turn, ready to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric trailed her, his voice warm with a teasing question. &#34;Are you worried about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained neutral, her voice cool. &#34;Did I say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t, but I know you&#39;re worried about me. You don&#39;t want me to go after the inheritance because you&#39;re afraid of what Hamilton might do, right? You don&#39;t believe Hamilton is the type to let things slide. If l return to the McCoy family, he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to reign over me. He wants to dominate my every thought, my wealth, and every aspect of my life.Am I wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both understood, their minds sharp as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No guesses were needed; they saw straight through each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spared him a glance, her eyes calculating. &#34;I got it right, didn&#39;t l?&#34; Cedric continued, a small smirk on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed,responding matter-of-factly, &#34;Yes, that&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric laughed, unconcerned about the storm he might face upon his return. He had unwavering faith in Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His trust could only be described as blind faith-absolute and unquestioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that if I return, you&#39;ll protect me,&#34; he said, his voice steady and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed deeper. &#34;In my plan, there&#39;s no room for you to return.You need to stay here and manage Phillips Group properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the McCoy family...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They owed her and Cedric, and she planned to take back what was rightfully theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phillips Group isn&#39;t worth managing. I&#39;m not bragging, but among Hamilton&#39;s sons, I&#39;m your best choice.&#34;Cedric stood in front of Daniela, unwavering in his gaze. &#34;You have to trust me. I&#39;m not that easy to control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips together, turning and walking on. Cedric followed, his voice light and inviting as he asked, &#34;So, have you agreed?&#34; His tone was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, her steps halting for just a moment. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled as he trailed behind her, hands casually tucked behind his head, strolling with an easy gait.&#34;Wherever you go, l&#39;Il be right there. Whether you choose me or not, I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped inside the house, but Cedric paused, pulling out his phone to text Ryan and Lillian.&#34;When are you coming back? If you don&#39;t hurry, Daniela might just dump me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group chat had only the three of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly replied, &#34;Such a waste of your good looks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chipped in, &#34;Exactly. She can&#39;t resist your charm. Just stay close, be a little clingy, and she won&#39;t push you away.You know she&#39;s more responsive to warmth than force.&#34; Lillian added, &#34;Exactly. Be as persistent as Alexander. With that handsome face of yours, she will be won over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ran a hand through his hair, mock exasperated. &#34;You better hurry back, or if I get dumped, I&#39;m blaming both of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian laughed. &#34;She won&#39;t let us come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan added, &#34;Otherwise, we&#39;d already be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Daniela descended the stairs and spotted Charles sitting in the living room, clearly having been there for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles rose, smiling the same way Kohen had the night before. &#34;Good morning, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela greeted him casually, but the housekeeper added, &#34;He&#39;s been here for over three hours and has had more than ten cups of coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed her, &#34;It&#39;s fine. You can continue with your duties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Daniela stepped out, and Charles rose to his feet, having placed some health supplements on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re not lacking anything, so I picked something rare and hard to come by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of the three, Charles was the most shrewd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling at Daniela, he added, &#34;You know why I&#39;m here today, so I won&#39;t waste time. I know the McCoy family has a debt to both you and Cedric that must be repaid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow. Charles was sharp, fully aware of her plans. And he laid it out without hesitation.</p>
