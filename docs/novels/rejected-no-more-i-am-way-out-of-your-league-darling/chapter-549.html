                <p>The moment those words left Hackett&#39;s lips, everyone stiffened except Winslow. His eyes stayed vacant, his expression detached, as if he were still half-asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett swept his gaze across the room. &#34;Look for yourselves. If you&#39;re truly fine with this, let&#39;s just act like this meeting never took place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying no more, he turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley quickly got to his feet,blocking him.&#34;Hackett,take a breath. We haven&#39;t even started talking, and you&#39;re already fired up. That&#39;s not like you. We&#39;ve always had each other&#39;s backs, and now you&#39;re making it sound like we&#39;re strangers. Come on, we need to stand together, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc rose as well. &#34;Exactly! With something this serious, none of us can afford to stay out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp Morris furrowed his brow. &#34;We&#39;ve already tried everything, and none of it worked on Daniela. What&#39;s left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve imposed sanctions, we&#39;ve reasoned with her,but nothing gets through. What else is there?&#34; A heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Alexander returned from abroad, fresh from his plastic surgery, the entire domestic landscape had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, he absorbed the market shares that once belonged to Bruno and Huey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within just two weeks, Bennett Group successfully integrated the assets of Fairburne Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Capitalizing on this golden opportunity, Bennett Group skyrocketed into the market&#39;s spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face lit up with excitement as he watched Bennett Group&#39;s stock rise steadily. Turning to Alexander, he said, &#34;Alexander, we&#39;ve officially made it onto the world&#39;s billionaire list. We may not be at the top yet, but it&#39;s a solid beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes traced the latest rankings, drifting from Bennett Group&#39;s position to the undisputed leader-Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard let out a light chuckle. &#34;We can take our time catching up, but honestly, I don&#39;t think you need to wait until your wealth matches Daniela&#39;s. Everyone knows how effortlessly she makes money. And once you&#39;re family, does it even matter? There&#39;s no need to compete. Your wealth will end up in you children&#39;s hands anyway.&#34; Alexander nodded; the logic made perfect sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When lovewas genuine, wealth became irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Daniela wasn&#39;t the type to care about money anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander studied his reflection, his gaze scrutinizing the freshly refined features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, check my left side. Does it still look uneven compared to Cedric&#39;s? It doesn&#39;t seem as seamless to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard examined him briefly. &#34;Not atall. It&#39;s flawless.If you and Cedric walked side by side, I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the inside of his arm,where there was a faint scar. With it, Daniela would never be able to tell him apart from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If a fake is convincing enough to fool the world,it becomes real!&#34; Alexander mused as he kept looking at his face in the mirror. This face would be his key to winning Daniela back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flickered to Cedric&#39;s schedule displayed on his tablet. His plan was simple--slip into Cedric&#39;s world piece by piece until he became Cedric entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett made his way to Richard again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Hackett placed a check for eight hundred million in front of Richard, Richard&#39;s eyes gleamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No hidden agenda here. I&#39;m getting old, and I can&#39;t hold on to this seat forever. We&#39;ve all witnessed the Bennett family&#39;s rise. We believe Alexander should take over as the new president of the commerce association,&#34; said Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard barely contained his delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was common knowledge that the association&#39;s membership fees were exorbitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association&#39;s membership fees alone were enough to support countless individuals for ten lifetimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the presidency? It carried perks far beyond what met the eye. In the corporate world, it was akin to holding a crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A golden opportunity, huh?&#34; Richard&#39;s gaze lingered on the check, his grip on reason hanging by a thread.&#34;But why Alexander?&#34; Hackett flashed a knowing smile, producing an antique he had long cherished. &#34;Come on, Richard. We&#39;re all friends here. No need for questions.Leadership should be in the hands of the capable. And with Alexander&#39;s talent, isn&#39;t he the natural choice for the top spot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett had his eyes on Alexander because of Daniela&#39;s years of attachment to Alexander. Once Alexander took the presidency, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have the heart to move against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More importantly, Alexander understood Daniela better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was said that the closest people knew each other&#39;s weaknesses best. Compared to anyone else,Alexander had the upper hand when it came to understanding Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the presidency-once the dust settled, Hackett had every intention of taking it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, Alexander would be his pawn, paving the way for his true ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s scheme was meticulous. He had a knack for reaching his goals without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett departed Richard&#39;s office brimming with confidence. After all, who in their right mind would turn down the presidency of the association? Hackett strode away, his confidence unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Daniela dealt with Farley first, then Tripp,and finally Marcus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, their reputations were left in complete shambles, and unrest spread like wildfire throughout the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, the association was flooded with an overwhelming number of refund requests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Hackett and the remaining seven rushed to the Bennett family&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until this point, everyone-except for Hackett and Winslow-had suffered major financial turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, gripped by anxiety and fear, stole a glance at Winslow&#39;s unwavering calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling realization crept in-he was next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The looming uncertainty, paired with the certainty of his downfall, nearly shattered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation,he gathered his people and sought out Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Richard didn&#39;t invite them in. Instead,he handed back the check and gift Hackett had previously offered. &#34;Sorry, I spoke with my son. He told me that Daniela isn&#39;t someone who loses her temper easily or acts out of arrogance. If she&#39;s coming after you now, it means you must have done something to provoke her. We&#39;re staying out of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s expression darkened with unease. &#34;But this is the presidency of the association! Are you saying Alexander truly has no interest in it? You might want to reconsider!&#34;</p>
