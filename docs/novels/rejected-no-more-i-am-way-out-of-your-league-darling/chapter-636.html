            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric made his way down the stairs, he crossed paths with Alexander, who was holding an elaborately prepared meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took one look at Cedric&#39;s modest food box and scoffed. &#34;Is that what you&#39;re feeding Daniela?Have you forgotten who she is? This is just pitiful. Do you even realize what I&#39;ve prepared? I hired a Michelin -starred chef to craft a feast with the finest dishes from multiple countries-each one worth a fortune.And I went the extra mile, serving them in 16th-century antique bowls, chosen especially for her. Now,that is what true indulgence looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Alexander droned on about his grand gesture,Cedric&#39;s attention flicked to the private executive elevator as it quietly descended to the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the window, Cedric spotted Daniela&#39;s car pulling out onto the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Cedric! Have you no manners? I&#39;m talking to you!Are you deaf?&#34; Alexander snapped. Cedric didn&#39;t bother replying. He simply turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Alexander, regaining his composure,turned to the security guards with forced politeness.&#34;Excuse me, could you inform Daniela that I&#39;ve brought her lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards responded flatly, &#34;She just left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander blinked in disbelief.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She just drove off,&#34; the guard reiterated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flickered across Alexander&#39;s face. He couldn&#39;t understand what had caused Daniela&#39;s coldness towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t she supposed to have suffered from amnesia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should still feel something for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why was she acting so indifferent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online rumors were already swirling, suggesting that Daniela&#39;s public outrage stemmed from his confrontation with Cedric at the charity auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Supposedly, that was what had triggered their fallout. But Alexander refused to accept that. Without her memories, Cedric meant nothing to Daniela. He must be approaching this all wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was just about bringing her lunch, he could outdo Cedric-by a landslide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Alexander settled in, waiting outside the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this didn&#39;t impress her, he was ready to go even further-he&#39;d bring the entire kitchen staff straight to her doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, completely unaware of Alexander&#39;s antics,Daniela headed to the supermarket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was pushing the cart, and as soon as Daniela entered, she spotted a familiar figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the other person spotted her, shock flickered across her face, and the cabbage in her hands tumbled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Harper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her memory still lost, Daniela didn&#39;t recognize the woman standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only recalled that this woman had once worked as a servant at Cedric&#39;s home. &#34;Josie,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bending down, Daniela retrieved the fallen cabbage and handed it back to Josie. Josie&#39;s eyes darted nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look&lt; like you&#39;ve seen a ghost,&#34; Daniela remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie hesitated before nodding. &#34;I thought you were dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a small, knowing smile. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie hastily shoved the cabbage into her cart,her face draining of color. &#34;I have something urgent to do.Let&#39;s talk another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she all but fled, Daniela&#39;s gaze trailing after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed hiseyes. &#34;That was suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicious was an understatement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Very few people had access to Daniela&#39;s villa back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s reaction alone spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, do you think Cedric knows about Josie&#39;s connection to the explosion? Or was he involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent and strode to the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned to Elite Lux, Alexander  was waiting downstairs. &#34;Hey, Daniela.Have you eaten yet?&#34; Her gaze flicked over the extravagant spread Alexander had prepared. Unimpressed, she replied coolly, &#34;I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, she walked past him and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly called after her. &#34;I&#39;ll bring you dinner tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And true to his word, Alexander showed up that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Josie arrived at the first-floor restaurant of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at a distance, Alexander leaned towards Carol and asked, &#34;What are they talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t bother to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from Daniela, Josie sat stiffly, her hands gripping her knees as she fidgeted anxiously.&#34;1was so busy this afternoon. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t have time to talk earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a slow sip of water, her gaze drifting to the window. The sky threatened rain. &#34;Does Cedric know you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie lowered her head. &#34;He doesn&#39;t. Actually,when he came to me a few days ago to learn how to make a dish you used to love, I realized you had returned.How have you been? Have you recovered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie studied Daniela, who sat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt different now-colder, distant. She used to smile. Now, it was as if she had forgotten how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember anything from before?&#34; Josie asked anxiously, staring into Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t remember,&#34; Daniela said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie let out a small breath of relief-until Daniela&#39;s next words cut through the air. &#34;The child is gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie flinched, her body trembling. Her wide eyes met Daniela&#39;s, stunned by the cold sharpness in them. Her lips quivered, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice remained eerily steady. &#34;He was five months along. They told me it was a boy. But in the explosion, amid the smoke and fire, he was gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s face drained of all color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, her voice devoid of emotion. &#34;If there had been no explosion,my child would be three years old now. Cedric has good genes -he would have been a handsome little boy, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie squirmed, her hands gripping the edge of her seat as if trying to steady herself. &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I nearly died. Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric were all seriously injured. What kind of grudge could drive someone to do that?&#34; Daniela leaned in slightly,her gaze pinning Josie in place. &#34;It feels like someone wanted to wipe us all out. Who do you think it could be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s entire body trembled, as if she might collapse right there.</p>
