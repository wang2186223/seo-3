                <p>A party was full swing in the bar. The booming music vibrated through the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crowd encircled Joyce, lavishing her with praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, you&#39;re incredible! Please, look out for me in the future! If you could just let me use a little corner of your studio to sell some essential oils, I&#39;d be set for life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, who said you could call dibs first? Joyce, we&#39;re friends, right? Don&#39;t forget about me! You&#39;ve got three whole floors. Let me open a shop on one! When I hit it big, I&#39;ll split the profits with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truly, Joyce is something else! Just her presence outshines girls from half the wealthy families here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! You guys don&#39;t even know how much Caiden cares for her. He spoils her rotten!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, so what if she disrupted Daniela&#39;s wedding and snagged her man? Even though Daniela heads Elite Lux now, she still has to cede those floors to you. And we&#39;re not talking about just any floors-these are premium, top-tier spots! Joyce, you&#39;re living the dream!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce flashed a smug grin. &#34;Of course. My family adores me the most. And Daniela? She&#39;s irrelevant. All of the Harper family&#39;s assets will end up with me eventually. Even the projects Daniela&#39;s pouring her heart into now-those will be mine, too.Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he&#39;s reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She&#39;s nothing compared to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted in cheers, raising their glasses in a toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A toast to Joyce! The future head of the Harper family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce raised her glass high, her laughter booming through the room. &#34;Cheers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This raucous moment was caught on video and quickly went viral online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Joyce racked up over four million dollars in charges at the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden saw the credit card alert, he was astounded,leaping from his bed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced the card had been stolen, he immediately phoned the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce was slowly coming to, groggily trying to sit up from the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt something cold and wet beneath her and looked down-her body stiffened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glaring red stain marred the sofa, jolting her fully awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, she scrambled into her skirt. As she looked up, she caught a glimpse of someone darting past the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop right there!&#34; she yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the figure was gone. Fuzzy memories from the night before flickered through her mind-she remembered clinging to a man in the dim light of the bar, kissing him, and noticing a small birthmark on the back of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rushed out of the private room, her heart pounding. Outside, her so-called friends lingered,equally disheveled and hungover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t left. They were all hanging around,hoping to capitalize on her newfound status related to the Luxor Tower-a chance none wanted to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce quickly tried to compose herself and left the bar, only to find herself facing a group of police officers at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, an irate Caiden and a distressed Katrina approached rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer, there&#39;s been a mistake!&#34; Caiden exclaimed,desperation in his voice. &#34;My card must have been stolen! My daughter doesn&#39;t drink-she&#39;s never had alcohol in her life-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His protest halted abruptly as he caught sight of Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she stood, disheveled and comical in appearance, with her hair a mess, eyelid stickers dangling precariously, and the family credit card dangling from her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words froze in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, his mind churned with a single thought.&#34;What a disgrace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he forced himself to swallow the insult,holding back his simmering anger. Today was her big store opening. Four million? It was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his fists tightly, the tension in his jaw betraying his struggle to maintain composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina went to great lengths to ensure Joyce&#39;s store opening looked grand, including renting several luxury cars to form an impressive convoy to the Luxor Tower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the ride, she placed a reassuring hand on Caiden&#39;s chest, patting it lightly to calm him. &#34;Honey,don&#39;t let it get to you. It&#39;s nothing to stress over. We&#39;ll earn it all back in no time. Think about it-business is all about connections. Sometimes, you have to spend a little to make friends!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden exhaled heavily, attempting to let her words soothe him. Then his gaze shifted to the back row,where two of Joyce&#39;s self-proclaimed &#34;best friends&#34;sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their appearances were jarring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wore mismatched,ripped clothing that gave the impression she&#39;d stumbled out of a haunted house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other sported multiple lip piercings that made Caiden wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were her connections?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two began chattering obnoxiously. &#34;Joyce,remember last night? You promised I could have space on the 18th floor to sell my essential oils!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden squeezed his eyes shut, the dull throb of a headache starting to build.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally arrived at the Luxor Tower,Caiden stepped out of the car, his irritation barely hidden.But then his eyes landed on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there, draped in an elegant Elite Lux early-spring couture outfit, radiating refinement with every movement. Though it was not yet 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, she had already finalized a major deal. Her poised, professional smile shone as she saw her client off with a courteous goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her assistant approached with a pile of documents,which she signed with practiced ease, her grace and composure unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her every action exuded calm authority, the undeniable presence of someone destined to lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Caiden straightened his posture,puffing out his chest. This was the epitome of a Harper heiress!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shame he&#39;d carried earlier began to ease,replaced by a faint sense of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s friends got out of the car to see Daniela speaking with her client, her poise and polished demeanor shining like a flawless diamond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! Joyce, your sister&#39;s really stepped it up. She&#39;s so classy now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! She&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux. It doesn&#39;t get any classier than that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, no. That outfit only works because Daniela is the real deal-a genuine heiress. Put it on a fake heiress, and it&#39;d just look tacky and completely out of place.&#34;</p>
