            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The Harper family&#39;s children played in the yard, their raucous laughter and chatter echoing loudly,shattering the tranquility and denying Katrina any semblance of rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against Caiden&#39;s chest, Katrina sought comfort. &#34;Honey,what did your mother mean by that?After all these years of marriage, why am I still an outsider in her eyes? Is it because I never bore you a child? I made that choice so Daniela could bask in a mother&#39;s love, sacrificing my desires for hers. And now,am I to blame for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked under the weight of her emotions,her sobs painting a picture of profound despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rested his arm lightly on her shoulder. &#34;She&#39;s my mother, Katrina. You shouldn&#39;t take her words to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s scowl darkened as she crossed her arms tighty. &#34;And what am I to do now? How do I even begin to explain this to Alexander and Richard.Joyce&#39;s pregnancy will soon be visible to all.&#34; She sat up abruptly, wiping away her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, let your mother think what she wantS. I&#39;ve  weathered much for the love of you, and I&#39;ll bear this too.But not Joyce-she doesn&#39;t deserve this agony.Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll pick out a cafe.You get the lawyer there. We&#39;ll transfer the company shares and your personal assets into Joyce&#39;s name.After that,I&#39;ll meet with the Bennett family and secure her engagement to Alexander. Once we&#39;ve got everything locked down, any objections your mother has will be meaningless by then. What do you think about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes shimmered with eager anticipation, her gaze fixed on Caiden as she hoped for an affirmative response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Caiden remained engrossed in his mobile game, his head bowed, seemingly oblivious to her anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he responded without looking up, &#34;That won&#39;t work out. The moment my mom finds out,she&#39;ll lose it completely. She can&#39;t stand people scheming behind her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face fell, and her fingers curled into tight fists, betraying her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her tension, Caiden glanced up briefly, his voice calm and unhurried. &#34;But seriously, what&#39;s the hurry? Is it really necessary for Joyce to marry Alexander right now? As long as I&#39;m behind her, she has the freedom to marry whoever she chooses.Why stir up unnecessary drama? If you provoke my mother and it affects her health, it&#39;ll become the talk of the town. And trust me, I&#39;d be the subject of ridicule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, a sly smirk tugging at thecorner of his mouth. &#34;Not that public opinion bothers me. I can handle abit of slander, but it would crush me to hear them speak ill of you. Let&#39;s hold off for now. Just focus on keeping my mom happy. If she&#39;s content,she&#39;ll approve anything you propose. Getting the assets into Joyce&#39;s name won&#39;t be a problem-it&#39;s all in the family anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was on the verge of speaking out when Caiden silenced her, guiding her towards the door. &#34;Enough of this, Katrina. Stop being so stubborn. My mother is here and you&#39;ve barely said a word to her. How do you expect her to warm up to you? Go and spend some time with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden brushed her off with a few words and went back to his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh of resignation, Katrina headed to Peyton&#39;s room,determined to make a good impression on her mother-in-law.She diligently massaged Peyton&#39;s legs,kneaded her shoulders, and even fetched a basin of water for her to soak her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before Katrina could shift the conversation towards her grievances about Daniela, Peyton interrupted with a yawn, declaring her exhaustion and her desire to retire for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Katrina retreated to her own room, only to discover Caiden already deep in sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming wwith irritation, she stepped onto the balcony,her fingers trembling as she dialed Richard&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,always pragmatic, wasted no time in cutting to the chase. He stated that Joyce had to be officially declared the heiress to the Harper family fortune before any wedding plans could proceed. Why would the Bennett family invest in raising another man&#39;s child that Joyce was carrying if she wasn&#39;t acknowledged as the heiress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation left Katrina even more agitated.Just then, Joyce entered the room, visibly distressed.&#34;Mom,why won&#39;t Dad transfer the family assets to me?Is he still thinking about fixing things with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not,&#34; Katrina declared with unwavering certainty.&#34;Your father holds my opinions in the highest regard.He&#39;s merely acting the part of the devoted son now because that old hag is around. Do you forget? She opposed our marriage initially, yet here l am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s anxiety seemed to dissipate at Katrina&#39;s assertive words. Later, she attempted to contact Alexander before retiring for the night, but received no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, the Harper family household was engulfed in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt completely swamped, rushing around in a frenzy to tackle the endless demands of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of this turmoil, Peyton took Caiden aside into the garden. &#34;You need to take Daniela back to our family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, unexpectedly compliant, simply nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking with satisfaction at his obedience, Peyton gave him a firm pat on the shoulder and inquired about Daniela&#39;s company address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before the towering Elite Lux building,Peyton craned her neck, awestruck by the architectural magnificence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Ronald, who was standing next to her,and questioned with a hint of disbelief, &#34;Is this really Daniela&#39;s company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald flashed a triumphant grin as he nodded.&#34;Without a doubt! Your granddaughter has made an outstanding mark in her field. Can you believe it?She&#39;s sitting at the very top as the wealthiest in the world! I&#39;ve heard her clothing line sells for outrageous amounts, hundreds of thousands each.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s expression illuminated with pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald assisted her toward the building&#39;s grand entrance. However, as they neared, a security guard stepped in front of them, blocking their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s smile faltered, his brow creasing with coldness. Despite this, the guard addressed them in a respectful yet firm tone. &#34;Ms. Harper is currently overseas at our main office. She won&#39;t return for another two weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Peyton maintained her cheerful demeanor,nodding appreciatively to the guard. With Ronald&#39;s arm for support, she turned and made her way back to the car. As they departed, Peyton cast a final glance at the building. A surge of pride swelled within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had left, Lillian emerged from her discreet spot and approached the guard. &#34;There&#39;s no need to inform Ms. Harper about today&#39;s visit. Let&#39;s pretend it never occurred. If they show up again, just let them know that she isn&#39;t available to see them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard gave a firm nod in acknowledgment.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela&#39;s phone lit up with a call from Richard. &#34;Daniela, are you free today? I&#39;d like to take you out for a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed in suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, known for neither his kindness nor his empathy, had never extended such an invitation before. Her mind flashed back to the days she had devotedly followed Alexander, seeking his favor,only to be met with Richard&#39;s scathing mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vividly remembered him belittling her in front of an audience, sneeringly branding her as &#34;merely Alexander&#39;s slave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, here he was, reaching out as if none of that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what&#39;s the matter? You seem quiet. Have you forgotten my voice?&#34; Richard chimed in, his tone overly cheerful. &#34;I&#39;m already at your office building.It&#39;s lunchtime, and believe it or not, we&#39;ve never actually shared a meal, just the two of us. And don&#39;t worry, Alexander won&#39;t be joining us. Come on, I was once your father-in-law.Would you really deny an old man a bit of company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that Richard wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and would likely persist if she declined, Daniela accepted reluctantly. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
