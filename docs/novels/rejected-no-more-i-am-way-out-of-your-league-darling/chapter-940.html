                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t be bothered, but he knew if this ended up in the news, Daniela would be dragged into it. So, he sighed, stepped aside, and called Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton grumbled as he reached for his phone.&#34;Who calls at this hour? Don&#39;t they know I&#39;m worried about my future grandson&#39;s living environment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Cedric&#39;sname popped up on the screen, he couldn&#39;t help but chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when he picked up, he tried putting on a serious tone. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can come in, but only if you agree to three conditions,&#34; Cedric replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton frowned instantly. &#34;Three? Isn&#39;t that a bit much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to protest, but before he could get a word out, Cedric had already hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood frozen for a moment, dumbfounded.Then he muttered, &#34;How could he be even more impatient than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary looked just as stunned. He scratched the back of his head awkwardly. &#34;Maybe... bad signal? Maybe the call dropped?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, Cedric flung his phone onto the couch. &#34;Looks like he really doesn&#39;t mind getting himself poisoned,&#34; he muttered and headed toward the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched him storm off, frustration written all over his face, and let out a soft sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to say something when the doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol opened the door and found Hamilton outside,visibly annoyed. &#34;Cedric, what&#39;s up with your phone?The reception is awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked, momentarily speechless. Daniela didn&#39;t know what to say either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want things to escalate, and she definitely didn&#39;t want Hamilton getting poisoned by those plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she stepped in quickly to keep things from going downhill. &#34;What Cedric means is-you&#39;re welcome to visit, but there are three conditions. If you&#39;re okay with them, you can come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes at her. &#34;Three conditions? I&#39;m coming to visit my grandson, and you&#39;re giving me terms? How is that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could finish complaining, Cedric was already turning around to shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit Hamilton-the call hadn&#39;t dropped. Cedric had just hung up on him, plain and simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, fine!&#34; Hamilton blurted, trying to sound composed but clearly flustered. &#34;What are the conditions?&#34; Cedric&#39;s stare was ice cold. &#34;First, don&#39;t bring anything into my house unless I say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scowled. &#34;And the second?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second, don&#39;t take anything out of here. Not even a scrap of trash. Unless I allow it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s scowl deepened. &#34;Seriously? What do you think I&#39;m going to steal from you? This is absurd!What&#39;s the last condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was cold and unflinching. &#34;Third, don&#39;t act like we&#39;re one big happy family. No calling anyone your son or grandson unless we say it&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one nearly sent Hamilton over the edge. His face twitched with fury, his fists clenched tigtly at his sides. But when his eyes met Cedric&#39;s, something in that steady glare made him swallow his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; he snapped, his voice rough with frustration.&#34;Your wife&#39;s pregnant, I get it. I&#39;ll play nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind that forced agreement, Hlamilton&#39;s mind was already churning-once the baby arrived, he&#39;d make</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sure Cedric knew who really held the reins. Cedric didn&#39;t waste another breath on him; he turned and walked straight back to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed. &#34;So this is how I get treated?|come here with nothing but good intentions, and you people treat me like a criminal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grumbling under his breath, he made his way outside to inspect the plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could wander too far, Daniela called out to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was visibly annoyed. &#34;What now? Are you both taking turns ordering me around today? What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela decided it was time to keep him busy. She handed him a garbage bag. &#34;There&#39;s something off about these things. Take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton peeked inside the bag. It was full of so-called gifts from his siblings. A cold snort escaped him as he muttered, &#34;What&#39;s the matter? They&#39;re just...&#34; .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he spotted something-an almost invisible wire sticking out from a doll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched down, picked it up, and gave the wire a tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a cold chuckle, he leaned closer to the doll and spoke into its hidden receiver. &#34;Hey, Jules,are you home? Sit tight. I&#39;ll be sending your precious little doll back to you real soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he shoved the rest of the gifts into the trash and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze followed his car as it sped past the workers quietly planting jasmines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walkedover and shut the front door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to him with a smile, Daniela said, &#34;Josh is getting impatient, isn&#39;t he? Sending all those people just to harm our unborn child... Cedric, I think it&#39;s about time I stop letting him think I&#39;m someone he can push around. Don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric arched an eyebrow as he looked at her and replied firmly, &#34;I agree.&#34;</p>
