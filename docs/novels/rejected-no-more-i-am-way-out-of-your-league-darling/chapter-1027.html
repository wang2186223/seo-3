                <p>Nikolas turned, a gentle smile playing on his lips as he met Hamilton&#39;s gaze. &#34;You know, if one day you&#39;re ever wronged or picked on, we might not step up to defend you. That sort of courage isn&#39;t in us. But if Daniela truly considers you family, I believe she&#39;ll stand up for you, just like she fights for her mother.In the end, isn&#39;t everyone simply chasing a fair shot at life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Nikolas offered a last smile before heading down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton remained rooted in place, caught in a quiet moment of contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed as he stood in silence, and eventually he looked up, his eyes landing on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned just in time to catch Hamilton&#39;s lingering gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ready to descend the stairs, Daniela was stopped by his voice. &#34;If your mom knew everything you&#39;ve done for her, she&#39;d be relieved and proud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Daniela froze, locking eyes with Hamilton as something unspoken passed between them. Some subtle shift had changed him; she could feel it. Moments later, as they left Josh&#39;s house,Hamilton&#39;s phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the call, eyes flickering to Daniela before stepping away, voice dropping. &#34;Why do you want to meet with Daniela? This isn&#39;t her concern. We&#39;re not about to follow you down this reckless path!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s voice erupted through the phone, wild and desperate. &#34;I&#39;m still a McCoy! How can you just ignore me? I&#39;m your brother, Hamilton. Brad&#39;s completely unhinged-he&#39;s killing without restraint. What makes you think you&#39;re safe from his wrath?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exasperation colored Hamilton&#39;s reply. &#34;Enough with the scare tactics! Brad has no reason to hurt me. I&#39;ve never done anything to cross him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huff of irritation came from Josh. &#34;Put Daniela on the phone! I don&#39;t have time to argue with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Hamilton ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, keeping pace beside Daniela, glanced over.&#34;What happened? Who was on the line?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shook off the question. &#34;Nobody worth worrying about-just a lunatic ranting. Let&#39;s head home. This isn&#39;t the kind of place Daniela should be dragged into. She deserves better than this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a few people up ahead turned their heads, he added with a touch of awkwardness, &#34;What if she gets frightened and it&#39;s bad for the babies?&#34; With that, Daniela and her companions made their way back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, a message from Josh appeared on Daniela&#39;s phone. &#34;Come to the hospital. It&#39;s urgent.I want to cut a deal with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ignored the message, making no move to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready to toss her phone aside when another notification lit up the screen, signaling a second incoming message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can see I have nothing left to offer. But didn&#39;t you ask for Ethan&#39;s and Brad&#39;s letters of confession?Don&#39;t you want mine? Don&#39;t you want it for your mother? You want us to confess to our sins,don&#39;t you?I&#39;m ready to give you my confession. Do you have the nerve to face me and take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t keep any secrets from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, having heard everything, replied without missing a beat, &#34;Let&#39;s head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick grin, Daniela pushed her chair back.&#34;Okay, let&#39;s get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness thickened outside while Cedric and Daniela slipped from the warmth of the house. At the doorway,Hamilton muttered, &#34;Goodness gracious! It&#39;s already eight. Why are you two stepping out at this hour?Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s not safe?&#34; Nikolas gaped at Hamilton, barely believing his ears.&#34;Seriously? Eight isn&#39;t even late. You must be joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon rolled his eyes and said, &#34;Remember when l left past midnight and you threatened to lock me out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran let out a laugh. &#34;There was a time I walked in at dawn for breakfast, and Dad practically banned me from the house. It&#39;s only eight. Most people are just starting to have some fun. Where&#39;s the danger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grin, Daniela reassured him, &#34;We&#39;re just stretching our legs. Give us an hour and we&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of disapproval crossed Hamilton&#39;s face.&#34;I&#39;m coming along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Daniela lost her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric found himself equally stuck, unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rose from his seat, unable to hide his disbelief.&#34;Look at them, Dad. That&#39;s a couple on a stroll, and you&#39;re not exactly fitting in. Why tag along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to argue. That brief distraction gave Daniela and Cedric the perfect window to slip out unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Hamilton realized they were gone,muttering under his breath in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas could only sigh.&#34;Dad, you do remember you&#39;ve got other sons,right?&#34; Kohen chimed in, &#34;Honestly, thefavoritism isn&#39;t subtle.You can&#39;t expect us not to notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles flashed a mischievous smile. &#34;If you want to depend on someone besides Cedric in your old age,maybe show us a little love too, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s laughter echoed around the room. &#34;He&#39;s got a point. Cedric&#39;s not exactly settling in for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran considered the group, then shrugged. &#34;If you ask me, Daniela&#39;s the one who&#39;s open to talk. Cedric puts up walls nobody&#39;s getting through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, not moving from his spot, narrowed his eyes. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s Daniela we need to reach. Cedric&#39;s like a locked door without a key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans began to form in Hamilton&#39;s mind. He&#39;d have to speak with Daniela once she was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her, he planted himself by the door,hopeful for her return.</p>
