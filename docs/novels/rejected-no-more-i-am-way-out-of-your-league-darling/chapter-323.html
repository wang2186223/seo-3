                <p>The secretary handed Cedric the phone number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric dialed it and said, &#34;Maximus Hlewitt, you truly are one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter stood frozen, listening as his boss offered profuse apologies over the phone, his voice trembling as though he were on the verge of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Cedric had released the reporter&#39;s collar, the man remained rooted to the spot, too terrified to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the reporter took the phone from Cedric, his boss&#39;s voice shouted from the other end, &#34;Kent Weaving,are you out of your mind? Didn&#39;t I make it clear toavoid any coverage involving Mr. Phillips? What on earth have you done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter whispered, &#34;I haven&#39;t taken any photos yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had, it would be the end of me! Who told you to photograph him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a low voice, the reporter replied, &#34;Katrina Harper paid me a hundred thousand. She didn&#39;t say much. She just wanted some photos. Then, out of nowhere, she knelt down. Before I could even use my camera, Mr.Phillips appeared. Boss, I&#39;m confused. Didn&#39;t you once say journalism sometimes requires unconventional methods?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.Unconventional methods are necessary-but not if they lead straight into a trap!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter exhaled sharply. &#34;Is the situation really that serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It most certainly is! Mr. Phillips is the major shareholder of our company. How can you not understand the gravity of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter&#39;s mind went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before Cedric, he stammered out an apology. &#34;Mr. Phillips, I&#39;m so sorry. I had no idea you were the major shareholder of our company. The offer was substantial, and I thought a few photos wouldn&#39;t be an issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s piercing stare cut through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching his camera, the reporter bowed repeatedly before hurrying away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Katrina remained kneeling in front of Daniela. And Daniela made no effort to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Filled with frustration and anger, Katrina glared critically at the reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still kneeling before Daniela. The scene was picture-perfect, and a single image could dominate the trending news about Joyce if it reached the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her hopes quickly crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the reporter dashed away, Katrina&#39;s frustration boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, she got to her feet and shouted, &#34;Hey! I paid you! You can&#39;t just leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice echoed, but it was too late. The reporter was already out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Katrina froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, still seated, observed her with a cool detachment. Her eyes reflected a cold indifference, as though Katrina were no more than a passing nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the reporter had disappeared, Katrina remained rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela moved forward, brushing past Katrina with her shoulder, snapping her out of her daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued on without hesitation, heading towards the garden-a place haunted by memories of her mother&#39;s tragic fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Katrina was preparing for one last desperate move. But she felt no fear. Instead, an odd surge of excitement coursed through her. As Daniela sat in the living room, Cedric entered and said, &#34;Katrina is desperate and on edge. She&#39;s bound to make a move soon. I&#39;m arranging extra protection for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stared at Cedric in surprise before turning to look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Okay.&#34; Her tone was sweet and compliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Lillian began coughing harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Lillian, who waved a hand dismissively. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.I just heard a spooky story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,indifferent to their interaction, frowned, grabbed his phone, and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once at the door, he wasted no time making a call. &#34;Logan, I need a team of mercenaries. Yes, only the top-tier bodyguards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched Cedric intently as he spoke near the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,why not tell Cedric that you&#39;re...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian could finish her sentence, Daniela&#39;s attention shifted slightly, prompting Lillian to ask curiously,&#34;Are you not going to tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied calmly, &#34;No. He worries too much about me. If he knew, it would probably keep him up at night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of thought, Lillian nodded in agreement. &#34;Indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric came back, Daniela was absorbed in her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to speak when Katrina burst through the door with an icy demeanor. Without a word,she walked in and headed straight upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric had anticipated Katrina would take some action, but they were caught off guard when she once again proposed divorcing Caiden. Daniela Tound the sight of the divorce ägreement rattyer arnusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never expected Katrina to be so terrified of dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce agreement was placed in the fiving room. Caiden noticed &amp; but only gave l a cursory glance before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, however, demanded he sign ft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing to Daniela, who was eating, Caiden said, &#34;Talk to her. Whatever Daniela decides, Pl goālong with.lf she approves, I&#39;H sign it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s hatred for Caiden was evident. &#34;I truly regret marrying you. Asshole!&#34; she said, before lunging at him, her long nails slashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was :not the type to stand by and take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long been dissatisfied with their situation and blamed Katrina for everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for her manipulations, he might have been content with Brylee forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he realized that the freedom of living off others far outweighed the fear of growing old alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that reflection,his regrets ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day,his frustration erupted into unrestrained fury.</p>
