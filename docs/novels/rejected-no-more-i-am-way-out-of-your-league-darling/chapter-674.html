                <p>Daniela&#39;s glare burned with a murderous intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was crisp. She had thrown on a loose pink coat,looking effortlessly pretty. People passing by couldn&#39;t help but glance at her twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Nikolas sat stiff as a board. It felt like he was staring into the eyes of something dark and unholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched him closely. Every tiny move he made didn&#39;t escape her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget who I am, Nikolas,&#34; she said. &#34;I outdid your father and became the world&#39;s wealthiest. I used to have nothing-no resources, no family backing-and yet l reached the position your father holds today.Need me to remind you how your family has become the world&#39;s richest? When I was lying in a coma, your father swooped in. Your so-called family pride? It means nothing to me. You&#39;re sitting on what used to be mine. And I was willing to hand it over to Cedric. So quit waving your money around like it matters to me or Cedric. Got that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas went still. His face lost all warmth. &#34;You&#39;re really choosing Cedric over the McCoy family? You used to be something, but that was then.If you cross my family now, don&#39;t expect it to end well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela banged her cup down. &#34;Go ahead. Try me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; breath turned ragged. His rage came out in full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, right.&#34; Daniela laughed. &#34;You&#39;re not even running the McCoy family. Hamilton is. You don&#39;t count in my world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela Harper!&#34; Nikolas shot up, slamming his hands on the table. &#34;You&#39;ve gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unfazed. &#34;Maybe. But what about you? You think you&#39;re ready to lead the McCoy family when you can&#39;t even keep your temper in check?|heard you have four brothers. Why not go with someone who won&#39;t blow up so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; cheeks flushed deep red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really backing Cedric in this fight for the legacy?&#34; He practically yelled it. But right after, he wished he hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat still, like his anger didn&#39;t even touch her.He,on the other hand, looked like a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sank back into his seat. She spotted Cedric through the glass. He was speaking with a security guard outside the Phillips Group building. The guard pointed toward the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her voice calm.&#34;We&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, ready to charge back at her, froze. Her answer caught him off guard. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you messing with me? What does &#39;we&#39;ll see&#39; even mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced toward the traffic light and saw Cedric waiting. &#34;It depends on whether he wants it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas followed where she was looking and spotted Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had on a brown coat that made him look gentle, though his slight limp made crossing the street a bit awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he didn&#39;t seem bothered and kept sneaking glances at the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t seem all that attached to him. Why go this far just to back him up?&#34; Nikolas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pulled her eyes away. &#34;He&#39;s hurt because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That got a raised brow from Nikolas. It was just an injured leg. Still, if someone helped him grab the McCoy family&#39;s fortune, he would gladly trade both of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he doesn&#39;t even want it?&#34; He didn&#39;t trust Cedric to aim high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he came from an orphanage. NNot exactly a place that bred ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured Cedric might just want a quiet life with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s what he wants, then fine,&#34; Daniela replied without emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if he says he wants it, you&#39;ll help him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iwill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then that makes us enemies. You&#39;re standing against the entire McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept walking, moving closer to the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose from her seat, not even glancing at Nikolas. &#34;That doesn&#39;t change anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric asked for it, she&#39;d give it all. She&#39;d fight to bring him back to where he belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped outside, and Cedric reached for her.&#34;Why did you come? Let&#39;s go to the canteen. Daniela stuffed her hands in her pockets, face unreadable. &#34;I&#39;ll eat when I&#39;m hungry. You don&#39;t need to come over. There&#39;s too much traffic out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat frozen behind the glass, watching them from inside the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acted like she didn&#39;t care, but as she crossed the road,she turned slightly, keeping an eye on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a low curse under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t just have a partner; he had a powerhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Nikolas&#39; phone vibrated with a new message. It was from the mercenary team he&#39;d just hired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, we&#39;re backing out. Didn&#39;t the former mercenaries inform you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas replied, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s wife is Clarinda, the leader of the Cealmaur.&#34;</p>
