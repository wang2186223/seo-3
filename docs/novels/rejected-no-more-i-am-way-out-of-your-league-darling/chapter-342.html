                <p>Daniela chuckled icily. &#34;You don&#39;t know? Then why did you plead with Cedric to send you to Zentara?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s heart raced, his eyes widening in disbélief as he stared at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you refuse to share a room with Katrina and insist on sleeping in the guest room? Or why did you suddenly feel the need to deliver that fruit knife downstairs in the middle of the night? Do you truly not know, or have you just been pretending all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stripped away his facade without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver coursed through Caiden. After a long pause, he asked, &#34;So you&#39;ve known all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t deny it. &#34;Why else do you think I move back to the villa?&#34; Caiden was left reeling in shock. Suddenly, the events of the past weeks all began to make sense.&#34;So,you came back on purpose. You just wouldn&#39;t let Katrina get away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing, her silence confirming everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s heart quaked as he gazed at Daniela, as though seeing her true self for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never fathomed that Daniela could be this calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I didn&#39;t kill your mother. I&#39;m still your father.Can&#39;t you show me mercy? I don&#39;t need much-just a hundred million, send me abroad, and I swear I&#39;ll never return. I&#39;ll leave everything of the Harper family to you. That&#39;s all I ask. Is that too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a bitter laugh. &#34;Even now, all you care about is money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, she refused to entertain him any longer. Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Daniela threw Katrina and Caiden out of the small house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reduced to the doghouse, Katrina snapped, charging at Daniela with a kitchen knife in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela narrowed her eyes, standing her ground with eerie calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a figure stepped in front of her, acting as a shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was kicked to the ground, her unhealed illness flaring up violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spewed from her mouth, mingling with the rain, eerily mirroring the blood that had pooled beneath Brylee&#39;s lifeless body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ambulance arrived to take Katrina away. As the paramedics loaded her into the vehicle, she fixed Daniela with a venomous glare and screamed,&#34;Daniela, you ruthless bitch! You&#39;ll get what&#39;s coming to you-just wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed composed in Cedric&#39;s comforting embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was paralyzed with fear, his legs trembling beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hastily packed his belongings that night and fled to the countryside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very day, Daniela went to Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden&#39;s departure, she ensured he transferred Harper Group&#39;s ownership entirely to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what brings you here today?&#34; asked her aunt, Elyse Dury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, who had been managing her own business,offered to assist Daniela after her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Brylee&#39;s close relationship with Elyse,Daniela had no qualms about her managing Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be taking over the management of Harper Group from now on. Thank you for all your hard work, Aunt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Daniela, don&#39;t be so formal. We&#39;re family. Your mother&#39;s gone, so it&#39;s my duty to look after you. If you weren&#39;t my niece, I wouldn&#39;t have left my job to come here. Brylee only had you, and I&#39;m here to ensure you&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had shared a close and affectionate bond with Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela stepped into Harper Group, Elyse presented her with the account books. &#34;Since you&#39;re taking over, it&#39;s wise to conduct a thorough audit.There are several discrepancies that need attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, armed with her extensive financial expertise,approached everything with precision and care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Elyse concluded, the department heads of Harper Group arrived to give their progress updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one voiced their appreciation for E|ysec′⁡S leadership during this transitional period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I finalized this order on my last trip. Daniela, let me know if you think anything needs adjustment,&#34; Elyse said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed through it; the details were precise,and the contract was flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, review it and tell me if there&#39;s anything else to adjust. I&#39;ll take care of it. I&#39;ve also had your office revamped with high-end furnishings. Let me know if anything feels off, and I&#39;ll fix it,&#34; Elyse offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small group of staff entered the office together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced around and remarked to Daniela, &#34;The view might not rival Elite Lux, but there are plenty of thoughtful details. Your aunt really takes care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression stayed neutral, and she offered no response to the remark.</p>
