                <p>When Brad, Jules, and Ethan stepped inside, unease gnawed at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They braced themselves, expecting Josh to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, to their surprise, he sat there looking calm and almost indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, the brothers relaxed and exchanged faint smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad leaned forward. &#34;Josh, let&#39;s be honest. The next head of this family won&#39;t come from your branch. So there&#39;s no need for you to meddle in this. It&#39;s strictly between us and Daniela,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded.&#34;Exactly, Hamilton talks big, but did he ever catch us doing anything? He didn&#39;t seea thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, wearing an icy look, added, &#34;Josh, what  makes Daniela think she deserves to call herself part of this family? And her child is definitely not one of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stirred his coffee and said mildly, &#34;No matter what you think, we settled this ages ago. When Dad passed, he made it clear-no one harms the McCoy children. You all swore to that then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone stayed calm as he spoke, and the brothers,seeing no anger from him, dropped the topic and switched back to sipping coffee and chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got up to leave, their faces showed nothing but satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad patted Josh&#39;s arm. &#34;Josh, McCoy Group&#39;s issues are in your hands for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added smoothly, &#34;We trust you to manage things well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan agreed, &#34;Josh has always looked out for us. No doubt about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chuckled among themselves as they walked out Once clear of the house, they huddled together,faces turning dark. &#34;Daniela must die,&#34; Brad hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules frowned. &#34;Timing&#39;s tight. Cedric and Hamilton watch her like hawks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sneered, &#34;In three months, the gender will show. If it&#39;s a boy, Hamilton won&#39;t blink. He&#39;ll guard her like treasure. We&#39;ll lose any chance by then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breath hung in the cold air, eyes sharp beneath the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came. McCoy Group&#39;s stock kept its nose-dive steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her office, Daniela flipped through report after report, noting how Josh had quietly shifted another big slice of company assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, glancing at the figures, clicked her tongue.&#34;Josh is sly. When the other branches see this mess,he&#39;ll blame you for the poor data, concealing his asset transfers.&#34; Daniela let out a dry laugh and looked at Carol. &#34;Did you set everything up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed her eyes and flashed a quick grin.&#34;Whenever you give an order, I deliver. Always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Josh stepped into his bedroom and paused; brow creasing at the faint smell drifting through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called out, &#34;Did you spray anything in here today?It reeks of jasmine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper shook her head quickly. &#34;No, Mr.McCoy. I haven&#39;t stepped foot in your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh leaned closer to the bed and sniffed again.The flowery note lingered, just barely there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper asked carefully, &#34;Maybe it clung to your clothes? No one&#39;s been inside today, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nodded but still prowled the room, peeking under the bed, checking corners, finding nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if he was imagining it. After a shower, he cracked open the tall window.A stronger wave of the scent floated in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper spotted this and explained, &#34;A new family moved into the villa across the road. The lady&#39;s crazy for jasmines. She filled her whole yard with them. Since your window faces that way, the breeze brings the scent in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That flowers reminded Josh of Daniela, and he couldn&#39;t stand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered, &#34;Tomorrow, tell that family I&#39;m allergic to jasmines. If they don&#39;t agree to remove the flowers, have my secretary buy the place outright.No jasmines near my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, sir.&#34; The housekeeper bobbed her head. But as she walked away, she grumbled under her breath, &#34;Is that really necessary? Buying a house just becäuse he doesn&#39;t like the flowers? Rjch people really live in another world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning, Josh&#39;s secretary had bought  the entire villa across the street. Josh stood on his balcony, watching workers yank out the jasmines one by one Only then did he feel at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, he slept like a rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he came downstairs the following day, he asked,&#34;Can you still smell anything floral in my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper barely looked up. &#34;Really? I don&#39;t catch a whiff, sir. But even if there&#39;s a trace, that&#39;s normal. They just moved out. The smell will fade in a few days.&#34;</p>
