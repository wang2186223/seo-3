                <p>Kohen stepped inside with his daughters in tow, a warm.smile lighting up his face as he greeted Cedric. &#34;We dropped by to visit Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched to their level, gesturing to Cedric. &#34;Girls,say hello to your uncle and aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girls peered up at Cedric, heads tilted in curiosity. &#34;Another uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family gatherings were a regular affair for the McCoys;it was perfectly normal for the children to have a whole roster of aunts and uncles to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen laughed and gave his head a gentle shake.&#34;This uncle isn&#39;t like the others. He&#39;s my brother-just like you and your sisters are to each other. We&#39;re connected by blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Cedric, hearing someone refer to him as &#34;connected by blood&#34; was a quiet revelation-he&#39;d never thought of himself that way before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his face unreadable, not betraying a single emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls formed a tidy row, voices chiming in harmony as they greeted Cedric and Daniela. Their formal manners didn&#39;t. last long; after the greeting, laughter bubbled up, their bright eyes curving into crescents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips softened into a gentle smile as she offered each girl a small, thoughtfully wrapped gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what grudges simmered between adults,the children stayed blissfully untouched by it all-innocent and utterly at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their infectious energy and wide-eyed wonder,the girls charmed everyone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They circled Cedric without a hint of fear, peppering him with curious questions and tugging at Daniela&#39;s sleeve, eager to know when the babies in her belly would finally arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lounged on the sofa, quietly observing Cedric&#39;s rare softness, the corners of her mouth lifting with a trace of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to hand it to Hamilton-he truly knew how to make things work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family treated this villa like a second home,always arriving with gifts or homemade pastries and leaving with Cedric&#39;s pickles. Mornings saw them stopping by with their children in tow, and evenings often ended with them strolling the garden with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house brimmed with warmth, the constant presence of family weaving joy through every ordinary day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s wife could talk circles around anyone,greeting Daniela as &#34;my dear sister-in-law&#34; with a lively affection that left no room for formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they strolled under the evening sky, Kohen glanced at her. &#34;Daniela, I heard you&#39;re heading back to Olisvine for the delivery. Every one of us is rooted here in Oiscoll. Once you come back, even with Cedric around, he can&#39;t possibly watch over you all the time. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to stay here? With all of us pitching in, wouldn&#39;t that make things easier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s wife jumped in. &#34;That&#39;s right! We&#39;ve raised three kids of our own. If anyone knows how to handle a house full of little ones, it&#39;s us. Twins are a lot for anyone-sooner or later, you&#39;ll need help, and who&#39;s going to care more than family? When the moment arrives, we&#39;ll be right here, every step of the way.Wouldn&#39;t that be perfect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela only smiled, offering no promises either way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas strolled into the kitchen and joined Cedric at the sink, rolling up his sleeves to help with the dishes. The gentle rush of water echoed in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said, &#34;You know, I once heard Daniela had a stepsister. I can see she&#39;s a lot like you, Cedric. She&#39;s never really known what it&#39;s like to have a real family.I can see she likes being surrounded by people who</p>
                
                
                
                <p>care. Maybe you don&#39;t think about it much, but we share a father. Even if there&#39;s been distance, that connection can&#39;t be erased. No one&#39;s got any hidden motives here-we&#39;re family, plain and simple. There&#39;s no reason to put your guard up. Back when Daniela was pregnant, our sisters-in-law wanted to stop by.Dad worried it might be too much for Daniela, but l always thought she liked the company. She has a soft spot for kids and a lively home. You try to do everything alone, but no one can shoulder the world by themselves. Staying here in Oiscoll, you&#39;d always have family to lean on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice remained cold and distant. &#34;Once we&#39;re back in Olisvine, the babies will arrive,and the house will fill with life on its own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas dismissed that with a gentle shake of his head.&#34;That&#39;s not the same at all. Kids need a lively crowd,a place full of cousins and noise. Just look at them now-barely knee-high,but already thriving together.Later, when you&#39;re juggling meals, school runs,hobbies... it&#39;s a lot for one pair of hands. With family around, we split the work. Alone in Olisvine, there won&#39;t be anyone to turn to when things get tough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared down at his hands, his face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas exchanged a quiet, resigned glance with Hamilton, who was in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, everyone&#39;s focus turned to Daniela.</p>
