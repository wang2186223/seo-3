                <p>Josie&#39;s heart ached as she watched Daniela. Here was a young woman who had grown up without anyone truly caring for her, yet she had emerged so strong, so compassionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had forced his own daughter to fend for herself, while lavishing affection on a spoiled, self-centered brat like Joyce. It was beyond comprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, eat this,&#34; Josie said gently, pushing a dish closer to Daniela. &#34;You&#39;re so young, yet you&#39;ve had to bear so much already. You&#39;re truly remarkable. If your mother were here, she would be incredibly proud of you. But, my dear, a girl can&#39;t rely on herself all the time. Being strong is admirable, but it&#39;s also exhausting. I can&#39;t do much to ease your burdens,but I can cook. If there&#39;s ever anything you want to eat, just tell me. You&#39;ve been staying up so late recently; you should go to bed early. Young women</p>
                
                
                
                <p>need to take care of their health, especially if they want a happy future and to find the right partner someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked a long, solitary road, carrying her burdens without complaint. She didn&#39;t think of herself as remarkable-she had simply done what needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, here was someone, a woman her mother&#39;s age, showing her genuine care. The warmth of Josie&#39;s words touched her deeply. Her smile grew as she met Josie&#39;s kind gaze. &#34;Thank you, Josie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s face brightened, her smile wide and affectionate as she looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was in her twenties-the prime of her youth-vibrant, radiant, and brimming with untapped potential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl like her, with such a kind heart, deserved someone who would truly cherish her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Harper, do you have a boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know a young man. He&#39;s handsome, well-mannered, and such a gentleman. Maybe I could introduce him to you sometime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a chuckle, shaking her head again.&#34;Thank you, Josie, but I&#39;m not ready for that right now. I just got out of a marriage, and honestly,I think I&#39;m a little afraid of the idea of marriage for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s expression turned thoughtful, her head nodding. &#34;You&#39;re right. Marriage is a big decision. It should never be taken lightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Josie turned back to the kitchen. A moment later, Lillian wandered in from the living room with a chuckle. &#34;Josie wants to set you up with someone? Who could she possibly know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at her and replied, &#34;Her intentions are kind. Don&#39;t make fun of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, Josie overheard their exchange.A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>small smile spread across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone and typed a message.&#34;Mr.Phillips, the person you chose is truly wonderful. But she said she&#39;s single right now and isn&#39;t considering a relationship at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came almost instantly-a frustrated emoji,its expression a perfect representation of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,as usual, sat glued to the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his phone lit up with a notification, he didn&#39;t even spare it a glance. Without bothering to see who it was from, he lazily flipped the device over, leaving the screen facedown on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina complained, &#34;Why don&#39;t you ever check your phone? What if Joyce has something important to tell you? How is she supposed to reach you if you&#39;re always ignoring your phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached over, snatched up his phone, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unlocked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression soured in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even bothering to open the message, she swiped left and deleted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, still engrossed in his show, didn&#39;t notice a thing. His tone remained casual as he asked, &#34;Is it Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s lips curled into a sly smile as she scrolled to his contacts list and blocked Daniela&#39;s number entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally satisfied, she let out a deep breath and smiled.&#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had wrapped up her tasks for the day.Fresh from the shower, she reached for her phone on the nightstand and glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still no response from Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle frown, she opened her news app, only to find the same trending topic dominating the headlines. Curious, she tapped on the link, and a video loaded almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene unfolded. Joyce, perched on a table at a bar, dancing with wild abandon to the pulsing beat of the music. Behind her hung a banner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations to Joyce Holt for Obtaining Floors 18th-20th of Luxor Tower!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at the video, momentarily speechless.After a deep breath, she forwarded the video to Caiden, intending to remind him once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she hit send, a small notification appeared on her screen, reminding her that she had been blocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze for a moment, her gaze fixed on the notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she placed the phone back on the bedside table, turned off the light, and slipped into bed.</p>
