                <p>Later that day, Caiden strode into the hospital with a lunchbox and a hefty book of baby names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He declared his mission to pick the perfect name for the newest addition to the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated next to him, Katrina offered a warm smile as she playfully fed him slices of orange. &#34;Joyce is truly selfless, isn&#39;t she? To forgo her right to pass on her own family name and instead let the baby have yours? Honey, should her in-laws ever treat her unjustly over this decision, you mustn&#39;t overlook it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind his reading glasses, Caiden thumbed through the book, shaking his head firmly. &#34;That&#39;s not going to happen. Joyce is doing so much for this family. If anyone even thinks of mistreating her, I&#39;ll be the first to defend her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina exchanged a sly glance with Joyce, her lifted eyebrows and mischievous grin hinting at quiet triumph. &#34;Exactly my point. It&#39;s clear you cherish Joyce above all. And think about Daniela and her accomplishments. Would she really risk a fallout with her future in-laws just to ensure the Harper name lives on? Yet here is Joyce, showing her loyalty to you without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden didn&#39;t glance away from the book, his voice cool and composed. &#34;Trust me, I haven&#39;t forgotten where my loyalties are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reassured, Katrina rose to go to the bathroom. By the time she returned, Caiden was already in the hallway, lost in lively conversation with his friends over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was still gripping the book tightly. His tone was light, yet a subtle trace of pride colored his words. &#34;Joyce is incredibly dedicated. The baby is hers. There&#39;s no need for it to take my surname.Why not hers, right? But you know what her response was? She told me she felt so indebted to me for all the ways I&#39;ve raised her, more than she could ever repay. She even quipped that had she been born  a boy, she might have changed her surname to mine a long time ago. Now, she insists I should be the one to pick the baby&#39;s name personally. I&#39;ve been poring over this book since dawn and I&#39;m still clueless, so l had to call you. Help me find a name that will bless the child with every possible good fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden reached out far and wide that afternoon,connecting with nearly everyone he could. His voice resonated down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time evening fell, the news had spread among all of Caiden&#39;s friends and all the patients on the same floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smirk sharpened, the hint of malice in her expression impossible to miss. Silently, she scoffed to herself, &#34;What an absolute idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Richard, worried that Alexander might encounter another setback, decided to accompany him in person this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alongside them, several project managers gathered,their spirits high. As they awaited Daniela&#39;s arrival, they engaged in light-hearted conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marco, this year has been phenomenal for you,hasn&#39;t it? You must be seeing some hefty profits from this project,&#34; one of them remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basking in the glow of a deep suntan earned from countless hours outdoors, Marco Pittman flashed a broad smile. His hands, large and calloused from the rigors of construction work, were a testament to his dedication, yet he exuded pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, we&#39;ve done quite well financially. It&#39;s a rarity to encounter someone like Ms. Harper who genuinely appreciates hard labor. She&#39;s always quick to pay and even quicker to lend a hand whenever we&#39;re in a bind. There was this one instance when a hurricane was on the approach, and I was concerned about falling behind. I nearly had the team work straight through the storm. However, she personally visited the site and declared she&#39;d extend our deadline by a full week. She remarked that we already put in more than enough effort and refused to push us further.During summer, she ensured we had chilled beverages, and when the cold hit, she didn&#39;t hesitate to provide heaters. She even constructed dormitories adjacent to the site for us. Having been in this industry for years, I&#39;ve yet to meet another leader as fair and compassionate as her. I&#39;ll undoubtedly give my all for her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul Brewer chimed in, &#34;I&#39;mn finally taking a real break this year, too. The project I&#39;ve been managing just wrapped up, and we passed the inspection yesterday. Ms. Harper has already transferred the final payment. It&#39;s a relief-I can face my crew with pride now. You know, with other contracts, payment delays are common, and I often feel embarrassed in front of my team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowvd erupted in hearty laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Marco, don&#39;t hold out! How much did you make? I heard about your new car. Seems like you&#39;re doing quite well for yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco chuckled, his complexion tanned from days in the sun. His eyes sparkled as he flashed a wide,toothy smile. Lifting his hand, he flashed a number with his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard glanced at him, presuming Marco was merely an amateur worker who wouldn&#39;t earn much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the moment Richard caught sight of the number Marco displayed, he was stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind reeled as if struck by a massive explosion.</p>
