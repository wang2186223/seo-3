                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even look back at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant&#39;s guests gazed at Alexander with a blend of shock and pity, their faces a canvas of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word to Richard, Alexander went straight home and impulsively set a wedding date with Joyce for the coming month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joyce was anything but elated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware that Alexander had sought Marlin&#39;s help in bring Daniela and him back together, only to be rejected at the restaurant earlier that day. Their clash had not only been captured but also plastered across the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, Joyce stewed in silence. So, after Daniela&#39;s rejection, he returned to her as if she were merely a fallback option?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to create a scene was overwhelming!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina, ever the voice of reason, urged restraint.&#34;Hold your horses, Joyce. Until that marriage certificate is signed, you&#39;re not yet a Bennett. Push Alexander too hard now, and you might lose everything if he flies off the handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce seethed with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should she settle for this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once thought herself the sole keeper of a special place in Alexander&#39;s heart. Was that belief now just a faded memory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina offered a comforting pat on her hand.&#34;Oh, my dear, don&#39;t be so quick to doubt. Remember,Alexander divorced Daniela for you. Now, he&#39;s ready to walk down the aisle with you. Daniela&#39;s just athorn in your side, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fists clenched, Joyce&#39;s anger simmered. &#34;Daniela! Itried to bridge the gap between us, but you&#39;re hell-bent on stealing my man! I won&#39;t let you get away with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexander drowned his sorrows at a local bar. Shaking his head, Keith remarked, &#34;You&#39;re a mess.You had Daniela but took her for granted, and now it&#39;s too late. Just because you can&#39;t have Daniela back doesn&#39;t mean settling for Joyce is your only option. Remember her mother? That&#39;s a window into the kind of drama Joyce could bring. Are you sure she&#39;s the right choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander slouched over the table, tuning out Keith&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visions of Daniela departing with Cedric haunted him repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he regret it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a chance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not one to harbor regrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning greeted Alexander with a throbbing headache. As he descended the stairs, he found Richard waiting, his expression clouded with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got a call from the Harper family this morning,&#34; Richard began icily. &#34;They say you&#39;re marrying Joyce next month. Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s true,&#34; Alexander replied, rubbing his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your senses? Even if you&#39;re dead set on marrying Joyce, shouldn&#39;t you at least discuss what she&#39;s bringing into this union? If you don&#39;t iron out these details now,how will you manage future disputes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was beside himself with frustration, convinced Alexander was becoming more reckless by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Alexander responded, &#34;Elite Lux is making significant inroads with Harper Group. Caiden seems to favor Joyce, and whatever she brings to the table won&#39;t be trivial. We have nothing to worry about.&#34; Richard remained irked. Just yesterday, he haddreamt of Daniela enriching their family with her wealth and status. Now, those dreams were pinned on Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about Daniela? Are you simply going to write her off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, drop it. She&#39;s history. I&#39;m moving forward with Joyce. Daniela and I are done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s dreams of wealth shattered in an instant. He let out a heavy, defeated sigh. &#34;I just hope you don&#39;t come to regret this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That struck a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s calm demeanor cracked. &#34;Regret? It should be Daniela filled with regret! I swallowed my pride to make peace, yet she chose Cedric over me. She&#39;s dead to me now, and I don&#39;t wwant to hear her name again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sighed once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a fiasco!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding was hastily arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their social circles, weddings demanded elaborate planning well in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina fretted over potential hitches before the big day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was keen to secure the financial perks tied to the union.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his bitterness towards Daniela, Alexander was adamant about proving he could move on by marrying Joyce next month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had their own motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sole beacon of genuine happiness was Joyce, buoyed by the belief that her love with Alexander was both deep and destined to endure forever.</p>
