                <p>Cedric was certain Daniela&#39;s heart would eventually soften.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she couldn&#39;t stand to see him suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, when love seemed absent between them,he believed there was still a tender spot in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he tried to win her sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped she might pity him and let him stay close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment,however, he didn&#39;t know what to say so that he could stay a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the honesty of a child caught in a misdeed,he lowered his head. &#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; Daniela interrupted before he could continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was gentle, preventing him from sinking further into humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t fully explain, she didn&#39;t want him to demean himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised, Cedric looked up, his gaze fixating on the  profile of Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;You knew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Daniela remarked, replacing the document before her with a fresh sheet, her voice steady.、&#34;It&#39;s okay with me. You don&#39;t need to feel ashamed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the day,Cedric found himself lost in a daydream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Incessantly, his thoughts circled around Daniela&#39;s assertion. &#34;It&#39;s okay with me. You don&#39;t need to feel ashamed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she okay with?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pretense of being pitiful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she not perceive it as a deceit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps another attempt was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she only buy his act? Or was she okay with anyone donning a facade of pity?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With merely a handful of phrases, Daniela had nearly driven Cedric to the brink of insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending doctor stared at Cedric andqueried,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What prompted this behavior?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was utterly lost in his reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, baffled, turned to Cedric&#39;s secretary for clarification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a soft chuckle, her eyes twinkling with amusement. &#34;Probably in love,I guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor raised an eyebrow. &#34;With Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. Mr. Phillips&#39;s dedication to her is legendary. It&#39;s as clear as day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation had been light and unassuming until Daniela&#39;s name came into play, at which point Cedric&#39;s attention sharply snapped to the speakers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a bit of insight here. Daniela told me, &#39;It&#39;s okay with me. You don&#39;t need to feel ashamed.&#39; How should I interpret that? Is she okay with my act? Or is she okay with anyone&#39;s act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the doctor and the secretary mistook it for a meaningful, complex question. Yet, it was disarmingly simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s anxiety was palpable as he pressed on. &#34;I need answers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, always to the point, requested clarification. &#34;And what did you say before she said that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his posture, Cedric replied, &#34;I told her-I pretended to be pitiful, trying to win her sympathy.&#34; The secretary inquired, &#34;Did she say, &#39;I&#39;m okay with your act?&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head dismissively, murmuring, &#34;No,she said, &#39;It&#39;s okay with me.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor rubbed his forehead and retorted sharply,&#34;Didn&#39;t she make herself clear? She meant the act itself-not just your act. You&#39;re reading too much into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary barely had a chance to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the sudden shadow that fell over Cedric&#39;s once bright eyes, the doctor was taken aback. &#34;Is it really that grave? If she didn&#39;t specify, wouldn&#39;t that include you as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung heavily throughout the therapy session;Cedric remained mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor found himself at a loss for words while the secretary shot him a scathing look, his teeth clenched in frustration. &#34;Can&#39;t you speak with a bit more sensitivity? He was just beginning to feel joy, and you&#39;ve shattered it. Do you have any heart? He&#39;s still healing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loyalty ran deep in Cedric&#39;s secretary, much like the staff at Elite Lux. Cedric had been in a prolonged state of despair,and just as a flicker of happiness had returned, lighting up the faces of Phillips Group employees, the doctor&#39;s careless words brought him crashing down again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was so frustrating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling somewhat alienated, the doctor&#39;s face betrayed his unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he not allowed to speak the truth? Did Cedric lack confidence in his relationship with his own wife?</p>
