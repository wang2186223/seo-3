                <p>Brad went pale in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton!&#34; he yelled, his voice rising above the soft buzz of the phone. &#34;Let me call Ethan. I&#39;ve got something I need to discuss with him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hamilton could react, Brad grabbed the phone and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his own device and pretended to make the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute, he gave a small smile. &#34;No answer.He&#39;s probably tied up. Hamilton, why don&#39;t you head back home? Once Ethan&#39;s around, I&#39;ll make sure he contacts you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton opened his mouth, ready to argue, but Brad added, &#34;Come on. Nikolas is home alone and won&#39;t eat. You&#39;re probably already worried sick. Go home.I doubt Ethan has anything urgent. Honestly, what could be more important than Nikolas right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton paused, then gave a nod. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Carol a glare on his way out, but stiffened when met Daniela&#39;s sharp look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad made up an excuse and slipped back to his room. Once inside, he shut the door and leaned against it,gasping. His chest rose and fell rapidly as panic took over. His heart raced so fast, it felt like it might give out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes shut, willing his body to settle down.It took a while before he finally made it to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Ethan was in the tub, still and silent,like he had fallen asleep. But the pale color of his skin told a different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad swallowed hard and grabbed his phone. He dialed Josh in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh answered with a sharp edge in his voice.&#34;What did I say? You shouldn&#39;t be calling me right now. The plan we fed to Daniela will blow up tomorrow. Cedric will be all over it. If you reach out now, you&#39;ll only drag me into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s voice grew colder with every word. It made Brad feel like Josh was pinning all the blame onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad paced, seething. Ethan&#39;s body was still in the bathtub. If Daniela died tomorrow, he&#39;d have to get rid of the corpse tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t, someone would find it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A body left in water too long would start to rot. Once the smell hit, there&#39;d be no hiding what he&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh, stop throwing this on me. Something&#39;s gone wrong,&#34; shouted Brad, his voice sharp. &#34;Help me figure this out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brad could say another word, the call cut out with a cold string of beeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the screen, stunned. He redialed, but the call was rejected. Again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind shut down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a number he didn&#39;t recognize lit up his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice followed. &#34;It&#39;s me.&#34; It was Josh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes were bloodshot. His voice dropped, cold and sharp. &#34;Why did you hang up? What was that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh spoke carefully. &#34;Anyone else there with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad felt his stomach turn.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a breath. &#34;Tell me what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad lowered his voice. &#34;Ethan&#39;s dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched across the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed hím?&#34; Josh said, slow and stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Brad answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve lost it,&#34; Josh snapped. &#34;Why would you kill Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad wiped his soaked face, water dripping from his hair. &#34;I didn&#39;t plan to. But he threatened to tell Daniela.He gave me no choice. Josh, he&#39;s still in the bathroom.I need you. I need to figure out what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh didn&#39;t respond right away. Then he spoke slowly,the words heavy. &#34;You killed Ethan. In Daniela&#39;s house.And now his body&#39;s in her bathroom? You seriously want to drag me into this mess with you?&#34;</p>
