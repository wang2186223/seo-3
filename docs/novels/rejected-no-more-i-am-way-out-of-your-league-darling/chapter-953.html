                <p>Brad paused for a second after hearing what Jules said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan remained unmoved. &#34;Josh took a huge chunk of the McCoy family&#39;s wealth without a second thought. At least Daniela is giving us a chance to talk.Did Josh ever offer us that? Josh always acted like he cared about us, but when it really counted, he betrayed us. Before all this, I doubted everyone else but him. Out of all of you, l was closest to Josh. But now, I have to admit-he&#39;s a real disappointment.I can&#39;t trust him anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad listened quietly, an uneasy feeling creeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules scoffed. &#34;Come on. You&#39;re acting like you wouldn&#39;t do the same if you had the chance. If you were offered the CEO position, you&#39;d probably take more from McCoy Group than Josh ever did. We&#39;re all human, so why expect everyone else to be better than you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan frowned. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll keep quiet. Anyway, Jules and I have made our positions clear. It&#39;s up to you to decide who to support. But as for me, I&#39;m done choosing Josh.&#34; Brad frowned as he watched his brothers walk away,then looked down,troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone rang and he answered. &#34;Hello,Lara.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I couldn&#39;t say anything earlier with the uncles there. Are they gone now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re gone,&#34; Brad said sharply. &#34;We&#39;re family. Why are you hesitating? Just say what&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I did this for you. In a big family, it&#39;s hard to keep everyone united. But think about it-Uncle Josh draining the family&#39;s assets didn&#39;t happen overnight.He always seemed like a good guy, but now we see his true face. It&#39;s scary. He didn&#39;t care what any of you thought. But Uncle Hamilton? He&#39;s spent years giving his all to this family. This must be hard for him too. He genuinely cares about the McCoy family. And Dad,don&#39;t go up against Daniela-you&#39;re no match for her.She built everything she has from the ground up,so don&#39;t underestimate her. If things really fall apart between the two families, you should side with Daniela. If she becomes ruthless later, you can ask Uncle Hamilton to speak on your behalf. You know he&#39;s soft-hearted and always puts the family first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad shifted uncomfortably at her words. &#34;What are you saying? That I have to depend on someone else now?&#34; Lara spoke confidently over the phone. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious, Dad? This isn&#39;t a crisis-it&#39;s your chance to team up with Daniela. You leaned on Uncle Hamilton for most of your life. Now, if you can count on Daniela for the rest, you&#39;ll be just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s sharp eyes narrowed. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara nodded while sipping her coffee. &#34;Absolutely.Everyone in the financial world knows Daniela-she&#39;s well-known. She treats her people well, especially Cedric. If you&#39;re kind to those close to her,she&#39;ll warm up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad straightened up eagerly, but after a pause,he added, &#34;But wouldn&#39;t that make me look spineless?Wouldn&#39;t you lose respect for your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara laughed. &#34;Come on, Dad. Since when have you been known for being tough? You&#39;ve got no other option anyway. Uncle Josh? HHe&#39;s only good at sucking up to Grandpa. What else does he bring to the table?If Daniela so much as sneezes, he&#39;s finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad nodded quickly. &#34;You&#39;re right.I nearly forgot that.Okay, I&#39;m going to see Daniela now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara nodded firmly. &#34;Yes! Go for it, Dad. Just remember-real kindness comes back to you. Our branch&#39;s future depends on whether you can get on Daniela&#39;s good side.&#34; &#34;Alright, I&#39;m heading over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call came to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad got ready with excitement and went home to grab a few luxury items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying them in his arms, he murmured, &#34;My precious treasures...letting you go hurts, but my family&#39;s future is riding on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out boldly, clutching the items in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out the door, his phone buzzed.He checked the screen. It was a new message from Lara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Dad, I almost forgot to mention-don&#39;t try to match Daniela&#39;s wealth. You&#39;ll never catch up, not in this life. So quit wasting money to impress her. Just remember,real kindness gets returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad looked at the precious items in his arms, stood frozen for a while, then let out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then tossed the items into the storage room and headed upstairs to pick out a plain-colored outfit.</p>
