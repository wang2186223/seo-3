                <p>The mnan with a scar across his face shut his eyes. His voice came out flat. &#34;Of course. We&#39;ve accepted the order. Backing out now would ruin everything we&#39;ve built.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy next to him glanced over at Daniela, who lounged inside the villa, tapping away at a game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, he hoped the Cealmaur leader wasn&#39;t as terrifying as people said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the rain poured hard. Thunder rolled in the distance like war drums pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The garden looked like a storm had torn through it.Petals and leaves were scattered everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By midnight, the downpour grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce climbed out of bed to shut the windows.Outside was nothing but a gray wall of fog. She couldn&#39;t see a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut the window and returned to bed, falling asleep instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun came up, and Joyce slowly blinked awake. Her thoughts turned to what she&#39;d noticed the night before.It had looked like a huge crowd outside. She flung the blanket off and walked to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,everything was still. Not a single bird made a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The garden below looked like it had been painted over. Flowers stretched across the beds in full bloom.Daniela wandered through them like nothing unusual had ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack wasn&#39;t far behind. He fired off questions while grinning from ear to ear. Daniela&#39;s face showed little emotion, but she answered patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if nothing had happened last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lay in the bed, feeling out of it. His head was heavy. He grabbed his phone and saw a screen full of voice messages from Mose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every one of them was longer than a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit play and listened while brushing his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose&#39;s voice came through, practically buzzing with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, you won&#39;t believe it. It was unreal. Completely blewN my mind!&#34; &#34;Clarinda is the real deal. I mean it. Do you even know how amazing they are? Get this. They fought off every attacker by themselves. Not one of them stood a chance. Those mercenaries? They couldn&#39;t touch Clarinda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And listen, boss, this next part? It&#39;s insane. Clarinda took down over fifty people. No weapons. Just their hands. And it only took them fifteen minutes.Fifteen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I had the wrong image of Clarinda. I thought they&#39;d be huge, all muscle and grit. Turns out I was wrong. Maybe five-five, slim, wearing all black,and hiding their face with a cap. Clarinda looked more like a girl than a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, Clarinda moves like lightning. Fast. Sharp.Untouchable. World-class, no doubt about it. Boss,I&#39;ve got to ask. Is Cealmaur looking for people?Because if they are, I&#39;ll quit Lone Wolf today. That&#39;s how hyped I am! Wow. I can&#39;t even help it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Cedric stopped listening. Mose&#39;s yelling had turned into background noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then called Mose. Mose picked up, still laughing like a fool. &#34;Are you really that thrilled?&#34; said Cedric.&#34;It&#39;s done. Get in touch with Clarinda. Set up a time for the asset transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose said, &#34;I checked this morning. They told me they&#39;re swamped and will handle the paperwork later.Boss, don&#39;t you think they&#39;re being a little too trusting with us? Then again, with someone like Clarinda around, no one&#39;s foolish enough to try anything shady.But still, now that you&#39;re broke, how are you going to break this to your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remembered what Daniela had warned him about the night before. He rubbed his temples and let out a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it felt like a mountain on his chest, he knew he had to come clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Cedric gathered his nerve and sat beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still reading from her laptop when she turned and glanced at him. He looked uneasy,like a kid who got caught sneaking out. &#34;I need to tell you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, leaned back into the couch, and met his eyes. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yesterday,I went bankrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Joyce stepped out at that moment. The shock hit them right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden blinked. &#34;Wait, bankrupt? Did I hear that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce laughed. &#34;Cedric, that doesn&#39;t make sense.Your company was supposed to be the next big thing. How could this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the business world, Cedric had a reputation for bouncing back from anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone said Alexander had gone bankrupt, they might believe it. But not Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat still, glancing at her, unsure of what she was thinking. &#34;It really happened. Just yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stepped closer. &#34;Are you in debt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;No. I&#39;m not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a breath and gave him a soft smile.&#34;That&#39;s a relief.&#34; Something about his bankruptcy made him feel less untouchable. She tilted her head.&#34;So,Cedric,what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he nudged Caiden aside and leaned in toward Daniela. &#34;There&#39;s something else.&#34;He lowered his voice. &#34;Along with going bankrupt, I have to manage someone else&#39;s company for ten years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze shifted to her. She still looked calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened. He could barely breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric swallowed. &#34;For the next ten years, I won&#39;t be able to start my own business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Joyce gasped at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes softened. She gave him a look that carried both pity and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who used to call the shots now looked like he&#39;d been knocked to the bottom of the ladder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned down, voice gentle. &#34;Are you doing okay with all of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clicked his tongue. &#34;You&#39;re basically in the same boat as me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t care much about their comments. He kept his eyes on Daniela, looking for something in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still have a salary, so I won&#39;t be poor. Daniela, could you say something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him,silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no intention of helping him manage his company. She understood he needed to let go of everything for survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep down, she resented how easily he gave up ten years of his life like it meant nothing.</p>
