                <p>Hamilton was in the middle of his investigation when he decided to call Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His only purpose was to get him home and find out if he knew anything about Daniela&#39;s vulnerabilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like before, Damon picked up the phone without even glancing at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other side, Hamilton could hear Damon nagging Daniela like an annoying puppy. &#34;Come on, just one more game! Please! | refuse to accept that | lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice remained calm and detached, a sharp contrast to Damon&#39;s excitement. &#34;I&#39;m about to head into a bidding meeting. I don&#39;t have time for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come with you. I know plenty of people in Oiscoll, and I can make sure no one competes against you.Please, just one more game!&#34; Damon pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton squeezed his eyes shut, already picturing his śon&#39;s shameless persistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fury boiled over. This was an absolute nightmare!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What sort of son had he brought up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hamilton could even shout, Damon hung up after saying, &#34;I&#39;m busy right nowN.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, Damon had mistaken him for one of his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took a long breath, struggling to keep his fury in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked down the stairs, Alexander was waiting below and greeted him with respect. &#34;Mr. McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a simple nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they made their way to the bidding meeting, Hamilton asked Alexander again, &#34;Did you remember anything about Daniela&#39;s weaknesses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused for a moment before he answered, &#34;Nothing concrete, but she might be afraid of heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t press the issue any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already reviewed all of Daniela&#39;s details the day before and knew her fear of heights came from her mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Hamilton doubted that was Daniela&#39;s real weakness, especially since he&#39;d seen her fly a plane himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone terrified of heights take control of a plane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a casual nod to Alexander&#39;s answer. Just as he was about to open the car door, Daniela and her group pulled up alongside them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard Damon whining to Daniela, &#34;When we get,back, you have to play one more game with me.I swear,if you don&#39;t, I won&#39;t find peace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Hamilton felt his own peace slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking through the glass, he spotted Daniela standing up front with Cedric by her side. Behind them were Nikolas and Damon, with Carol following behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Damon begged, Daniela leaned toward Cedric to say something quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gazed thoughtfully at Daniela&#39;s profile, clearly deep in contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation prickled Hamilton&#39;s skin as he watched, while Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed, his anger simmering beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was it that whenever a member of the Hamilton family approached Daniela, she never pushed them away? Why did it feel impossible for him to even get a word in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t ready to leave the car just yet. The embarrassment was too much to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never felt so humiliated in his ife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising sons like these, utterly useless, had dimmed the glory of his once-proud life, especially watching them currying favor with Daniela like devoted fools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really brought up so many sons only to watch them grovel for Daniela&#39;s attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to endure the shame,Hamilton decided to wait inside before making his move out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander moved first. He stepped out and approached Daniela.&#34;It&#39;s been a few days, and you&#39;re looking more radiant than ever, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, still pleading, suddenly caught sight of a face he found irritating and snapped, &#34;Buzz off! Wait your turn. I&#39;m not done talking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon was spoiled rotten and mastered the art of sweet talk. His brothers had always pampered him, so indulgence came naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to Alexander, Damon paid no mind and didn&#39;t take him seriously at all.</p>
