                <p>Anxiety gripped Alexander immediately!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to follow Daniela, his phone erupted with the shrill ring of an incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Katrina on the line. He pressed the decline button, but she was persistent, calling again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He declined once more, only for her to send a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,Alexander,justpickup already-it&#39;simportant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, Katrina&#39;s urgencies revolved around Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything less seemed to barely stir her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang yet again, and this time, Alexander couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, barely getting a word out before Katrina&#39;s anxious voice spilled through. &#34;Alexander, I&#39;m terribly sorry to call so late, but I&#39;m really at my wit&#39;s end. I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Katrina&#39;s response was a flood of tears, her voice cracking with emotion. &#34;Alexander, Joyce had a prenatal check-up today, and the doctor fears there might be complications with the baby&#39;s heart. They said it might need immediate surgery after birth to survive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice broke as she continued, the sobs shaking her, &#34;Alexander, it&#39;s my curse to be stuck with someone as cold and soulless as Caiden. All I have left in this world is Joyce, my sweet daughter. If she&#39;s taken from me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the strength to keep living this wretched life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was hardly in the mood to entertain Katrina&#39;s theatrics. He went straight to the point,his voice cutting through the tension. &#34;Just tell me what you want from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, her tears momentarily forgotten as she considered her plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she truly desired was for Alexander to intervene in Joyce&#39;s predicament. The blame, in her eyes, lay squarely with Daniela. If not for her, Joyce would have been Alexander&#39;s wife by now,uniting their families and sparing her this torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by a resolute desire to see Daniela held responsible, Katrina implored, &#34;Alexander,your group operates a healthcare company, doesn&#39;t it? Could you  possibly find out if there&#39;s a top specialist capable of performing such a surgery? Or maybe there&#39;s a way to treat the baby without surgery. It&#39;s heartbreaking to think of the baby facing a lifetime of medication after surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander fell silent, absorbing her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of Daniela flickered through his mind, along with Dreamscape&#39;s cutting-edge medical solutions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, such innovations would need official approval, clinical trials, and extensive marketing-a process spanning at least a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But time was a luxury the child did not have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sliver of hope emerged as he considered whether Daniela might be persuaded to grant an exception for Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander confided in Richard, his response was fierce and immediate. &#34;Stay out of it, Alexander! This mess isn&#39;t worth ruining yourself over! Daniela has completely severed ties with the Harper family. What business is it of yours to interfere? Think about it-if they mend fences and Daniela ends up backed by the Harpers, given our past run-ins with Katrina, do you seriously believe she&#39;d make peace with us? And what about Joyce? How will you face her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Richard pondered the situation,the more  his disapproval grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let Daniela and the Harpers go their separate ways! Offering help is generous, but choosing not to is your decision. Nobody can fault you for that.Listen carefully, Alexander, don&#39;t even think about getting involved in that mess! You don&#39;t need to sort this out.Leave it to me,&#34; Richard insisted, his voice laden with concern that Alexander might be too compassionate for his own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was a treasure too valuable to let slip into anyone else&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm resolve, Richard muttered, &#34;I&#39;ll call Katrina myself. Why the hell are you always dragged into their mess? You&#39;re not even family! They&#39;re just using you like a damn tool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Richard seized the phone and quickly exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, I regret to inform you that our medical division lacks the necessary technology and expertise.However, I&#39;ve done some research on your behalf.Lipool Hospital is renowned for its proficient techniques-you might want to consider consulting with them. It&#39;s critical to address these matters promptly, especially if surgery is on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, a hint of caution in his voice. &#34;Furthermore,  I must mention, Harper Group&#39;s performance hasn&#39;t been doing so well lately. Should the public learn of your child&#39;s health issues, it could negatively impact your stock prices. I&#39;d advise you to secure a competent surgeon soon. The advancements in medical technology these days generally assure successful outcomes. Please, try not to worry excessively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina found her usual poised demeanor slipping away, caught in a whirlwind of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wholeheartedly believed in Richard&#39;s sincerity and quickly expressed her gratitude before reaching out to the recommended doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Alexander was aware that the doctor in question was hardly a specialist in cardiac matters and had a checkered past with several medical controversies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s maneuvers were strategically aimed to eventually reveal Daniela&#39;s role as the CEO of Dreamscape, leading Katrina to suspect Daniela had knowingly remained passive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to make Katrina hate Daniela to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a scheme was devilishly clever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, it was a stroke of genius.</p>
