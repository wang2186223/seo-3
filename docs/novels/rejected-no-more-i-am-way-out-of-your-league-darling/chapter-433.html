                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;You&#39;re telling me Caiden is here? In a mental hospital? Why would your father be in such a place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already entered before Elyse could complete her thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gust of wind at the entrance made the light above sway ominously. Elyse realized they were isolated in the desolate surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her hand tighter and hastened inside with Nina&#39;s support.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chilling wind screamed into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is unsettling. I&#39;m covered in goosebumps,&#34; Elyse murmured to Nina, feeling uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation was interrupted by a distant scream, accelerating their steps to catch up with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse called out, &#34;Daniela, what caused your father&#39;s sudden illness? Were the medical checks comprehensive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela ascended the stairs, her silence thickening the air around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lights threw unsettling shadows across the room. Each step was accompanied by the sound of labored breathing, heavy and ominous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if a wild beast lurked in the darkness, silently watching their every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The click of Nina&#39;s high heels echoed ominously off the sterile floors, amplifying the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, have we arrived?&#34; Elyse asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the enveloping darkness, Daniela halted and turned to them with a chilling smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight drained the color from Elyse&#39;s face. For a fleeting second, she thought she saw Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice then cut through the heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt,what scares you so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was about to dismiss her fears, but Daniela continued down the corridor before she could respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading them to the end of the hallway, Daniela stopped at a room divided by a glass partition, reminiscent of a prison visitation area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They positioned themselves on one side of the glass partition as Caiden was escorted into view from the opposite side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Caiden came into sight, Elyse and Nina were struck motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this really be Caiden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice was filled with desperation as he pounded on the glass, his actions reminiscent of a trapped beast. &#34;Release me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed silently, her expression one of chilling detachment, as Caiden, his head shaved and body marred by injuries, continued to yell. &#34;Daniela! Let me go! I&#39;m not mad! I&#39;mn your father; you cannot do this to me! Let me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet of the night was shattered by Caiden&#39;s pained cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards forcibly restrained him, commencing a brutal beating with a baton right before Elyse and Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grim sound of the baton connecting with flesh was distinct and unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ceased only when Caiden collapsed to the floor, a mere shadow of himself, gasping for air like a discarded puppet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse and Nina, immobilized by shock, witnessed the scene in utter disbelief while Daniela looked on,unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Elyse said tremulously, indicating the fallen Caiden. &#34;Did you not hear? He claims he is sound of mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laugh, cold and resonating oddly in the stark room, filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt, it&#39;s common for those afflicted with mental disorders to believe they are well,&#34; Daniela responded,locking eyes with Elyse. &#34;Were you aware? My father is indeed insane. He even alleges that my mother&#39;s death was actually a homicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Elyse became completely numb. Her thoughts ceased. She could no longer remember how to even muster a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous chuckle was all that Elyse could muster. &#34;How is that possible? But the police said it was suicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of Daniela&#39;s mouth turned up slightly, seemingly enjoying the gravity of the revelation. &#34;That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s lost his mind. He needs professional care. Don&#39;t you agree, Aunt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse felt a pang in her chest. &#34;Indeéd, you&#39;re right. Caiden must be suffering from a severe mental disorder!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile radiated a chilling beauty. &#34;Did I ever mention? I had cut off all ties with my father years ago.Yet,upon realizing his condition, I reconsidered. I&#39;ve since renewed our bond. It turns out, that only a direct relative can commit someone here. Isn&#39;t that the hallmark of a devoted daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran through Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned slightly to look at Caiden, who was still prone on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told her father, &#34;This way, we remain bonded as father and daughter, just as you always wished, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, drained of all resistance, his eyes brimming with despair, was helplessly dragged away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze to Elyse and Natalie, observing their ashen faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the silent drive back to the city, Elyse and Natalie shuddered in their fine garments, overwhelmed by their thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became starkly clear to them that Daniela bore no resemblance to Brylee. ndeed, Daniela was infinitely more cold-hearted and calculating than Brylee ever was.</p>
