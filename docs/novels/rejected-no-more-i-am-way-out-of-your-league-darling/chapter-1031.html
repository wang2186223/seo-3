                <p>Nikolas was done talking to Cedric. He decided to beg Daniela instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric got one thing right,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened up immediately while Daniela swung lightly,Cedric giving her a soft push from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked in confusion, &#34;What thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;If Carol wasn&#39;t interested, you wouldn&#39;t get anywhere near her. But if you&#39;re not determined enough, she&#39;ll bolt real fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;So, are you serious about her now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Should your dad and Carol have a conflict, who are you siding with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol!&#34; Nikolas answered right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed her eyes briefly, then looked at Cedric.&#34;What if our kids choose their partners instead of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked toward Nikolas, narrowing. &#34;We&#39;ll kick them out of the house.&#34;Daniela laughed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced Nikolas and remarked, &#34;Carol isn&#39;t unreasonable, so you don&#39;t need to blindly take her side. If she genuinely does something wrong, you can talk to her about it, and she&#39;ll listen. But that only works if your dad doesn&#39;t meddle. And from what I know,your dad loves to stir up trouble. I&#39;d suggest you handle your dad before you start pursuing Carol. Let me repeat-I won&#39;t let your father make things difficult for her. So if you can&#39;t get your dad&#39;s approval, you&#39;re not getting past me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing how glum Nikolas appeared, Daniela continued, &#34;Regarding Carol, like I mentioned, if she didn&#39;t care, you wouldn&#39;t even manage to reach her.She&#39;s already offered you a shot, but she won&#39;t wait endlessly. If you keep letting your father meddle in your relationship, she&#39;ll eventually leave. Do you get it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded instantly. This time,he finally grasped it. &#34;But it&#39;s impossible to change my father&#39;s mind.He only believes what he wants to believe. I&#39;ve tried everything, yet he still thinks Carol&#39;s background isn&#39;t good enough. What am I supposed to do? It&#39;s not like she could rewrite her background.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed mockingly. &#34;Must I guide you every step of your life? Can&#39;t you come up with any ideas on your own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas collapsed onto the floor. &#34;I&#39;ve tried,you know.I invited them both out for a meal, but it ended badly Later, I suggested they hang out together, but both of them looked grumpy throughout. Afterward, I invited them to a dinner party, but... I failed each time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric actually knew about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one occasion, while he cooking for Daniela,Hamilton barged in fuming, Carol trailed him, and Nikolas followed afterward,looking like a scolded pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela hadn&#39;t appeared, they might have erupted in yelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas recalled that time too-Daniela asked them in confusion, &#34;What&#39;s happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Hamilton and Carol smiled and replied, &#34;Nothing.&#34;Their expressions matched perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And out of nowhere, an inspiration hit Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up at Daniela with wide, desperate eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed only Daniela could resolve this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Daniela, I&#39;m begging you. Considering I&#39;m manage your enterprise alone-you&#39;re pregnant and Cedric has to look after you-please intervene!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Carol happened to notice Nikolas,who seemed to be about to kneel before Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol drew open the glass door, arms folded, and shouted, &#34;Hey, what&#39;s happening back there? Once you&#39;re done, kneel before me too.&#34; Carol always had a teasing side like that. She merely found it amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly. &#34;Come over here. He&#39;d actually do it for you!&#34;</p>
