                <p>As Alexander walked along, everyone greeted him with a respectful &#34;Mr. Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander acknowledged them with a nod. As he walked past Lillian, she looked up, slightly confused,and called out, &#34;Hey, didn&#39;t you leave to pick up some food for Daniela? You&#39;re back already? Did you get the food?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent. After a few more steps,he turned to look back at Lillian. She was smiling,her entire presence exuding an easy familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Lillian asked, still puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander simply shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized that as long as he bore Cedric&#39;s appearance, those close to Cedric treated him with warmth and regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander muttered to himself, &#34;This appearance really comes in handy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then entered Daniela&#39;s office and locked the door behind him. Outside, the sky had turned ominously dark. Rain was clearly on the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dimly lit office, Alexander&#39;s figure was barely discernible, his face only faintly visible in the subdued lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the dark clouds seemed to envelop Alexander,shielding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was engrossed in a game and didn&#39;t look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the lock clicking made her instinctively think it was Cedric, as he was the only one bold enough to lock her office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight smile appeared on Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Cedric, you know it&#39;s working hours, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The game company had recently launched a new game, and Daniela was testing it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it enjoyable?&#34; His voice was low and gentle,reminiscent of how Cedric often spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed, focused on her game. &#34;It&#39;s quite good,actually. Join me for a round later. The account number is 5566, and the password is the same. Hurry and log in so we can team up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were playing a team game against the game&#39;s developers. Upon logging in, Alexander was immediately greeted by the developers. &#34;Hey, Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their interactions suggested they played together regularly and were comfortable with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the game, Daniela was as skilled as ever.Whenever Alexander lost focus, she was quick to cover for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These moments reminded him of the last seven years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During that time, Daniela had been just as protective in real life, vigorously defending both him and his business interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Daniela, that&#39;s not fair! Why only look out for Cedric? Ah! I&#39;m out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a teammate was eliminated, the developers launched a fierce offensive against both Daniela and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Daniela managed to keep the upper hand,securing a strategic position that led their team to a resounding win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander put the game controller down and looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat back in her executive chair, her face lit up with a triumphant and relaxed smile, a contrast to her expressions over the past seven years. Seeing this, Alexander also let a smile spread across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her chair, Daniela looked to the door, still smiling. &#34;Why are you standing by the door? I can hardly see you. Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then moved to the sofa, her smile unwavering.&#34;Let&#39;s play another round!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She restarted the game, and the background music picked up energetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela noticed that the figure in the shadows hadn&#39;t moved. Her smile suddenly halted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ce...&#34; She cut herself off, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a new game, and their teamwork had been slightly shaky, which was why Daniela hadn&#39;t picked up on any anomalies until that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her phone down and rose from her seat,her intense gaze locked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she made a move towards it, the door clicked open, and the person in the doorway dashed away in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped in her tracks.In the corridor, Lillian shouted in bewilderment,&#34;Cedric, why are you running like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suspected something was amiss and approached Daniela.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,her eyes narrowed, stayed quiet and headed straight for the security room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Ryan was absorbed in his phone but looked up as Daniela entered, with Lillian close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela immediately brought up the security camera footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing off to the side, Lillian and Ryan appeared confused. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,isn&#39;t that Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He just left the building. How did he get back so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, leaning forward on the desk with both hands,said, &#34;That&#39;s not Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Ryan and Lillian were stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, Elite Lux enhanced its security measures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela later received a text. &#34;Be cautious of Hackett. He poses a threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave it little thought and erased the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commerce association soon discovered that Alexander&#39;s effort to approach Daniela had not succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett tried to convince them to make another attempt,but the members of the association declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They declared that, effective immediately,they would impose an economic sanction on Elite Lux and cut off all access to it.</p>
