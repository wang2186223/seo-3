                <p>That day, the scandal that Joyce was pregnant with another man&#39;s child and still pestered Alexander erupted across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very crowd that once lauded them while disparaging Daniela was now furiously posting online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Getting knocked up and then bugging her stepsister&#39;s ex-husband? That&#39;s some next-level desperation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard said it himself-Joyce&#39;s mom schemed her way into the Harper family by spreading her legs for Caiden.Guess neither of them has a shred of decency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor Daniela. Honestly, I&#39;ve always seen her as someone decent. But losing her mom so young and living under Katrina&#39;s rule must&#39;ve been brutal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online frenzy was growing more intense by the minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was sprawled on the couch, weeping so intensely that she struggled for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton remarked nonchalantly, &#34;The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree. Caiden, we&#39;re caught in your  storm. Haven&#39;t you noticed? Daniela won&#39;t even spare us a glance. I&#39;m warning you, Caiden. If she bears a grudge, it&#39;ll be on you to salvage any favors she might extend to Ronald and Wyatt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s tears stopped suddenly, her expression hardening in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she opened her mouth to object, Caiden cut in.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll handle it. Just leave Daniela out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he spoken than Ronald and Wyatt began to tally up their demands with their fingers.&#34;Caiden, since you&#39;re stepping up to take responsibility, we&#39;re not asking for much-just cars,houses,and a tidy sum of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt exchanged knowing looks and declared in unison, &#34;Eighty million each.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eighty million? Are you out of your mind?&#34; Katrina jumped up, her voice dripping with disdain. &#34;Just go rob a bank if you&#39;re that desperate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt frowned. &#34;Why the hell are you so worked up, Katrina? This isn&#39;t about you. We&#39;re talking to Caiden,not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are joint marital assets!&#34; Katrina argued, her voice firm. After years of dedicated service to Caiden,all she desired was a fair share of the wealth.&#34;Don&#39;t even dream of getting a penny from me unless I fucking allow it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald glared at her, jabbing a finger in her direction.&#34;What bullshit are you even talking about? Joint marital assets? Do you even have any claim to this money? This is the legacy our former sister-in-law left behind. You have no part in this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stormed into the kitchen, snatched up a knife,and bellowed, &#34;Anyone who dares touch my family&#39;s fortune will answer to me. I&#39;ll make damn sure you regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shitty past, riddled with hunger and hardship,crept back in, making Katrina tremble. Giving away eighty million to those leeches felt like signing her own death warrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed by the prospect of death yet terrified of destitution, Ronald advanced, his face defiant, and taunted her. &#34;Go on, do it if you&#39;ve got the guts!You&#39;re nothing but a bitch, Katrina. If you can&#39;t bring yourself to do it today, that money is as good as mine!What&#39;s the matter? Are you scared? Let me tell you something-within these walls of the Harper estate,you&#39;re not the one in charge...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cut off mid-sentence as a sinister gleam flashed before his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Ronald&#39;s scream ripped through the air as a knife plunged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spattered everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the piercing scream of Peyton. &#34;You fucking bitch! How dare you assault my son! I swear,I&#39;ll fight you to my last breath!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after,the wail of an ambulance filled the estate,rushing three members of the Harper family to emergency care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, the knife still embedded in his cheek, was in the gravest condition, his screams barely audible above the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused at the doorway, her hand tightly clutching the knife, while a piercing cold wind moaned through the night. ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Joyce shuffled forward, her legs barely supporting her trembling frame. Her voice broke through her tears as she murmured, &#34;Mom, you attacked Grandma and both uncles. Are you going to be arrested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife slipped from Katrina&#39;s grasp, clattering against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slumped against a stone pillar, her gaze burning with fierce resolve. &#34;No, your father will protect his image at all costs. If word of this spreads, Harper  Group&#39;s shares will nosedive. They&#39;ll have to keep quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was determined to prove that she was not a woman to be underestimated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the hospital, Caiden was overwhelmed by despair. Ronald had sustained the gravest wounds;Wyatt was writhing from a back injury, and Peyton,having fallen, had broken her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their cries of agony echoed through the sterile corridors, each one stabbing at Caiden&#39;s conscience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haunted by the lifeless look in Katrina&#39;s eyes as she brandished the knife, he knew her intent had been lethal. She had truly been prepared to kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s knife was lodged deep in his cheekbone,necessitating its removal, yet no specialist in the area was available in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor suggested, &#34;Mr. Harper, maybe your daughter could help. She&#39;s quite worldly and might know someone who could assist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who not only operated a successful design firm but also ventured into the medical field, was well -equipped. Much of the hospital&#39;s cutting-edge equipment came from her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her connections and resources dwarfed their own. Caiden, clutching a phone borrowed from the doctor,stepped aside and implored in a hushed, desperate tone, &#34;Please, as a personal favor to me, could you come to the hospital? This is a life-or-death situation.Even if you don&#39;t consider us family anymnore,perhaps you could help us as mere strangers in dire need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down his face as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brylee was there, she fortified his world,giving him the freedom to live a blissful life, playing with his pets without a second thought. 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Brylee&#39;s passing, he stepped back from the company,thriving on the monumental empire she left behind, enough to carry him through forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His days were filled with bliss, enchanted by Katrina&#39;s captivating presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, confronted with this dire crisis, he was begging Daniela for help.</p>
