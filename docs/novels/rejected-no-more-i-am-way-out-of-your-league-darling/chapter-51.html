                <p>From the moment Katrina&#39;s gaze fell upon Cedric,her smile was unwavering. She regarded him as an exemplary choice for a son-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning towards Caiden, she murmured, &#34;Cedric really is something else, isn&#39;t he? Look how polite and considerate he is. We haven&#39;t even officially started, and here he is, already bearing a gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, watching Cedric&#39;s poised and respectful manner, nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s grin broadened with pride. &#34;You see,honey? This is all my doing. Had I not nurtured Joyce so well, she might have ended up like Daniela. Think about it-when we&#39;re old, who will we depend on?Certainly not Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an eager nod, Caiden responded, &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. Joyce is all we&#39;ve got. Daniela?She&#39;s a lost cause, utterly unreliable for the rest of her pathetic life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt a surge of elation, her beaming smile proof of her delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She advanced a few paces towards Cedric, her focus turning to the vase the building manager held.A glimmer of recognition danced in her eyes. &#34;Hang on... Isn&#39;t that from last night&#39;s auction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in Katrina&#39;s eyes as she leaned toward the vase. Yet, as she approached, the manager recoiled instinctively, clutching the vase closer to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression hardened with irritation, but she smoothed it over with an overly sweet smile as she pivoted towards Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Cedric! How incredibly thoughtful of you! This vase is the one from last night&#39;s auction,right?remember it fetching a million. How lavish of you! Tell me, is this splendid piece meant to celebrate Joyce&#39;s store opening? Your generosity knows no bounds!Yet, how can we justify accepting such a prized treasure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her words, Katrina closed the distance once more, her hands seizing the vase from the flustered manager, who found himself helplessly cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the vase pressed to her chest, she flashed a radiant smile, her face glowing with a sense of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building manager stood frozen, a look of utter disbelief painting his face as he gazed at his now-empty palms, then turned to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s features turned stormy. His eyebrows drew together, casting his face into an icy, uninviting expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager, overwhelmed by the moment,exclaimed, &#34;Seriously? Are you out of your mind?What on earth are you doing? This isn&#39;t just reckless -it&#39;s outright robbery!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in complete shock, questioning whether this was typical behavior for women of affluent backgrounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina couldn&#39;t care less. To her, the vase was already hers. She believed Cedric was going to be her son-in-law. Why couldn&#39;t she take that vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt not just justified, but determined, having already selected the perfect spot for the vase-in the living room of their home. This was more than decoration; it was a declaration. Her daughter was now Cedric&#39;s cherished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching, Caiden lightly grasped Joyce&#39;s elbow,his expression full of quiet approval. &#34;This is such a wonderful gesture. Thank you so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Cedric,&#34; Joyce chimed in with a shy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining his composure by a thread, Cedric resisted the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience wearing thin, he turned to Katrina with a cold stare. &#34;Who gave you permission to be here?&#34;His tone cut through the air, sharp and unforgiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, taken aback, blinked in confusion. After a moment, he chuckled awkwardly. &#34;What do you mean by that? The entire floor is ours now. Actually,not just this one, but the two above it too. Daniela handed over all three floors to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Daniela&#39;s name, Cedric&#39;s demeanor turned to one of solemnity, and he turned sharply to confront the building manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager, his forehead slick with sweat,hastened to clarify, &#34;No, Mr. Phillips, their shop isn&#39;t located on this level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, her brow furrowed in bewilderment,interjected sharply, &#34;Our shop isn&#39;t here? Then where on earth is it supposed to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling a deep, weary sigh, the building manager tapped his phone with a sense of urgency. &#34;Jerry,come upstairs and escort them to their designated space,&#34; he instructed, before turning to Katrina with a stern gaze. &#34;I must urge you to be careful as you exit. Every item here is a valuable antique, with each piece carrying a significant price tag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped towards Katrina, his hands extended,ready to ease the vase from her desperate grip. &#34;Mr.Phillips, I&#39;ll ensure this vase is delivered to Ms.Harper&#39;s office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric watched the exchange, his eyes darkening as he viewed the vase. &#34;It&#39;s already dirty,&#34; he declared,his disdain palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager paused, his bewilderment plain on his face.&#34;Sorry.What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered no further explanation. &#34;Just get rid of it,&#34; he stated dismissively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, anything Katrina defiled with her touch was as good as garbage, a disgrace to Daniela&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered the elevator without another word,his expression unreadable, yet his revulsion was clear.Katrina made a half-hearted attempt to reach out, to halt his departure, but the elevator doors sealed shut before she could utter a single plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building manager exhaled a deep, tired sigh and ambled over to the trash can. With a resonant clang,he dumped the vase into it without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes stretched wide in shock. Casting aside any semblance of composure, she dashed to the trash can and leaned over, her arms plunging in to rescue the vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling it protectively, she muttered in disbelief,&#34;How could anyone toss away such a stunning vase?It&#39;s worth a fortune! Oh, no-look, there&#39;s a chip on the rim!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Joyce stood by, utterly mortified, their cheeks burning with embarrassment as they observed Katrina&#39;s frantic actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Joyce&#39;s friends exchanged glances,their eyes wide with shock, their whispers intensifying as they struggled to mask their astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is utterly disgraceful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has completely tarnished the image of every dignified lady! Can you believe Cedric refused the vase just because she handled it, and now she&#39;s scavenging it from the garbage? Did you see the desperation in her actions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truly, though, it&#39;s hardly shocking. I heard that Katrina only secured her place in the Harper family after Daniela&#39;s mother passed away. Before that,she was merely a humble villager, busying herself with pickling vegetables. It seems she employed every cunning tactic available to seduce Daniela&#39;s father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All that money, and she still can&#39;t shake off the pitiful aura of someone who&#39;ll grovel for scraps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, coming from modest means is no fault of her own. But where is her sense of pride? Has she no self-respect at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Self-respect? Please. It&#39;s doubtful Katrina even understands the concept. I heard that right after Daniela&#39;s mother died, Katrina moved in. Driven by fear of missing her chance at wealth, she disregarded how blatantly disgraceful it appeared. A woman of her sort-do you really think&lt; she possesses any self-respect?&#34;</p>
