                <p>As the workday drew to a close, Elyse arrived at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she went upstairs to see Daniela, she turned to Natalie with a reassuring smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Daniela may be tough, but she&#39;s not tougher than Brylee was. Remember, Brylee was once the wealthiest woman in the country, and yet, she still met her end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after Elyse spoke, the elevator doors slid open in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile instantly vanished from Elyse&#39;s face, and her thoughts scrambled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Daniela overheard her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assurance Elyse felt just seconds before drained away. She asked tentatively,&#34;Daniela, what brings you down here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded simply, &#34;We&#39;re going to see Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse trailed behind her and entered the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a seat in the back with Daniela, while Natalie sat up front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the drive, Elyse stole glances at Daniela, searching her expression for any sign of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela&#39;s face was so composed that Elyse couldn&#39;t determine if she had caught any of their earlier conversation by the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, noticing Elyse&#39;s nervous movements in the rearview mirror, looked over at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she smiled and said, &#34;Daniela, how is Caiden doing? Mom and I are quite concerned about him. Even though your mother is gone, Mom and I still feel like we&#39;re family with Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze to the window. The orange streetlights outside bathed her face in a cold, detached light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Natalie finished her statement, she shared a quick look with Elyse, then continued with a smile,&#34;Daniela, you know, just before we got on the elevator, Mom and I were discussing the mother of a classmate of mine. She was a lot like Aunt Brylee,such a capable woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie aimed to redirect their earlier conversation, implying they had been speaking about someone else,not actually Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, did not respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie caught a glimpse of the back of Daniela&#39;s head, felt a sinking feeling, and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car continued its journey, ascending the winding mountain road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the bustling streets of the city and ventured into a more isolated road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approacheda particularly dark stretch without streetlights, Natalie&#39;s unease grew. &#34;Daniela, we are going to see Caiden, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse peered into the dark night outside, her anxiety intensified. &#34;Daniela, where are we heading?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela placed her hands on her knees and replied, &#34;We&#39;re on our way to see Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night deepened, and the surrounding scenery grew increasingly barren and sinister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse scrutinized Daniela, catching glimpses of her face in the sporadic moonlight, revealing a chilling,almost dangerous sharpness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But this doesn&#39;t seem like the route to any hospital,&#34; Elyse said, her voice filled with alarm as she gripped the seat in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the enveloping darkness, Daniela chuckled lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound was haunting, filled with a clear threat. Natalie&#39;s heart raced, her voice quivering as she asked, &#34;Daniela, wheré éxactly are you taking us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the faint light streaming in, Daniela turned to face them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their expressions were etched with real terror, as though they had just grasped the full meaning of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed entertained by this. &#34;Aunt Elyse, why are you frightened? If your conscience is clear, you shouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about. You&#39;re a righteous person, aren&#39;t you? What could possibly scare you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was caught off guard. She wasn&#39;t sure whether Daniela&#39;s comments were pointed or merely offhand,but they unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not scared,&#34; Elyse said, clenching herjaw.&#34;What reason do I have to be frightened? I haven&#39;t done anything shameful. And surely, your mother is looking out for me from heaven. After all, I was her sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the car came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the door and announced to those inside, &#34;We&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse instantly turned her head, her heart racing with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was this place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eerie, flickering light cast unsettling shadows around them. The entrance sign was askew, its letters hard to decipher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With reluctance, Elyse got out of the car, clutching Natalie&#39;s hand firmly. She nudged the entrance sign with her foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clang! The abrupt sound made them both startle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly took out her phone, using the flashlight to illuminate the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sign read &#34;Shadowpeak Madhouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last letter·was barely visible due to weathering, while the other letters were painted in a disturbing shade of what looked like red paint or perhaps dried blood, adding to the ominous atmosphere. &#34;Daniela, what on earth is this place?&#34; Elyse asked, her voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded their frightened faces with contempt. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you wanted to see Caiden? He&#39;s inside. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
