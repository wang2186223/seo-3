                <p>Daniela kept her voice steady. &#34;Hamilton, let me make this clear. If I find out you&#39;re still trying to set up a meeting between my husband and the princess, I won&#39;t be this nice next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;What if Cedric actually likes the princess? What are you going to do then? You think you can stop him? If your man&#39;s drifting toward someone else, maybe that&#39;s on you for not keeping him close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric happened to walk in from the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother whispering. She said into the phone, &#34;You started this mess. If Cedric ends up interested in her, I&#39;ll blame you for it. From now on, every time she shows up near him, I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re the reason-and you&#39;ll have to deal with what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had never met a woman who could hold a room like she did. &#34;So if Cedric falls.for her, it&#39;s my fault now? Seriously? The princess is beautiful. It&#39;s not exactly shocking if he&#39;s into her. And if you can&#39;t keep your husband&#39;s attention, maybe that says more about you than it does about me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to take Daniela&#39;s phone and talk to Hamilton when Daniela replied firmly, &#34;Exactly. I will blame you. If this marriage breaks down because of anything that happens from here on, it&#39;s on you.So you&#39;d better think twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out an exaggerated sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Daniela had already ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen off to the side. He used to think Cedric was harsh toward Hamilton, but now he realized Daniela was the real force to be reckoned with. She didn&#39;t just hold her ground-she flipped the whole battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave her a silent thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grabbed the next file from her desk, already moving on, while Cedric walked over with a grin. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere. You&#39;re the only one I&#39;m into.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas almost groaned. That was way too much affection in one room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled back. &#34;Smart choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked a few times, floored by the sugar overload.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked like he was going to pop a blood vessel. He stormed down the hallway, cursing loud enough for the whole floor to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary raised an eyebrow. Given how petty he could be, she figured he was about to start plotting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, Hamilton planted both hands on his hips. &#34;Set up a meeting with the príncess. And bring my five useless sons too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary frowned. &#34;Wait, what? Why them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face twisted in frustration. &#34;Why? What do you think? Daniela is ice-cold and terrifying. If I keep tossing the princess toward Cedric, she might actually snap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary leaned forward, voice tentative. &#34;So... you&#39;re backing out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed; &#34;Back out of a royal connection? Not a chance! Let the princess meet the rest of my sons.Maybe she&#39;ll like one of them this time. Women these days switch favorites like it&#39;s a game. You never know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary blinked. He hadn&#39;t expected Hamilton to fold so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t feel like the man he used to know. Daniela must&#39;ve shaken him good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... didn&#39;t she already meet them? And she wasn&#39;t interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, women could be unpredictable. But if she&#39;d passed on them once, chances were slim she&#39;d change her mind. Not when Cedric set the bar so high. None of the others even came close. To be honest, the secretary thought Cedric was hard to top.- He couldn&#39;t help but wonder what Cedric&#39;s mother looked like-she had to be drop-dead gorgeous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught the look and smirked. &#34;Cedric&#39;s mother? She was stunning. A real head-turner in her day.She used to be a model, the kind who made jaws drop. She retired because of me. No one&#39;s ever matched her looks-not even my wife. That marriage was all strategy. Her face? Just okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary raised a brow. &#34;So... doesn&#39;t that make it even harder for your other sons to impress the princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clenched his jaw. &#34;Do you have a better idea? Just let it play out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love was weird like that. Sometimes it hinged on a smile, the right kind of lighting, or a well-timed joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the McCoy brothers were told to show up at a club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was all soft lights and low music-every room felt like a romantic setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas barely stepped through the entrance before someone shoved him in and slammed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, the secretary said, &#34;Mr. McCoy, please wait here. Your father&#39;s on his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas spun around, stunned. He couldn&#39;t believe it. His own father had thrown him into this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone without thinking. His fingers dialed a number before his brain caught up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ride home, Nikolas sat quietly, thoughts racing. Why had he called Daniela? Out of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He played it over and over until the answer came clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had a way of making people feel completely safe, as if anything placed in her care would be protected without fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Nikolas said as he collapsed to one knee, trying to keep upright while making the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas?&#34; Daniela was confused. &#34;If you&#39;re calling Carol for a midnight snack, you&#39;ve got the wrong number.&#34;</p>
