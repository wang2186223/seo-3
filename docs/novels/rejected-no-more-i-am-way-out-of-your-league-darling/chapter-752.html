                <p>Nikolas looked down at Daniela, disdain sharp in his eyes. &#34;This is your last chance. If you want to surrender,now&#39;s the time. Otherwise, don&#39;t blame me when you get yourself killed out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tossed her hair back and answered coolly, &#34;Cut the crap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas chuckled low and cruel. &#34;Fine. If you want to die, I&#39;ll be happy to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting tall on his horse, Nikolas flicked a glance toward the first-floor stands and gave a quick signal to Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen caught the message right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a minute, he slipped out of the stands and strode across the racetrack, one hand hidden inside his pocket like he was carrying something he should not be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s secretary, watching from the side, stiffened. &#34;Mr. McCoy! What is Kohen doing?&#34; he whispered urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face stayed still as stone, but when his eyes shifted to Daniela, it was like he was already looking at a corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sneered, &#34;Isn&#39;t Daniela supposed to be the leader of Cealmaur? Let&#39;s see if she really lives up to the name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he spoke, a reporter edged closer, microphone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to the cameras with his practiced, easy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter asked, &#34;What are your thoughts on today&#39;s competition? Is Cedric really a member of the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept his voice smooth. &#34;It&#39;s just a little friendlycompetition among the young ones. It&#39;s not my place to interfere. Nothing serious will happen, so there&#39;s no need to worry. As for Cedric&#39;s place in the family, that announcement will come later. Stay tuned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, the secretary finally understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s race wasn&#39;t just about Daniela&#39;s life, it was also about whether Cedric would be accepted into theMcCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family had never had room for weaklings. Only the strong could stand among them. That was arule that never changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept answering the reporters&#39; questions, even as the starting whistle pierced the air behind himHe did not even bother turning around. There was no suspense. He already thought he knew exactly how itwould end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy silence behind him only confirmed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton remained composed, stil speaking smoothly, until a sudden collective gasp from the crowdshattered the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton finallv turned his head. He saw a stone fiving through the air, hitting Daniela&#39;s horse sauare in thebelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wild horse shrieked, reared up high, and thrashed in pure terror, its eves wide and furious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela clutched the reins with both hands. As the horse reared high, she leaned forward, her movementssteady and sure, When the hooves slammed back down, a thick cloud of dust exploded into the air, swirlingaround them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the only sound cutting through the thick silence was the steady, rhythmic beat of poundinghooves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the wild horse burst free from the dust cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long, breathless silence stretched across the arena. Then, without warning, the entire place erupted into thunderous cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amazing,Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,you&#39;re the hero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices rang out again and again, shaking the very stands. As the crowd roared, Daniela surged ahead,leaving Nikolas trailing a full lap behind. She crossed the finish line, winning the race by a landslide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; shouted the reporter who had been speaking with Hamilton. He spun around, thrusting his camera toward the giant screen. &#34;This is unbelievable! A true miracle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheers only grew louder, rising into a deafening roar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a long while before the excitement even began to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faces lit with awe and exhilaration filled the stands. Nobody remembered they were supposed to be rooting for Nikolas. Nobody cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All they knew was that they had just witnessed something unforgettable-an extraordinary moment of raw skill and fearless mastery over a wild beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the top trainers in the arena gave small, approving nods, acknowledging what Daniela had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had captured the entire scene on a live stream. Within hours, Daniela&#39;s race had gone viral across Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the world watched as the former wealthiest person showed them all what true greatness looked like. And they were left in absolute awe.</p>
