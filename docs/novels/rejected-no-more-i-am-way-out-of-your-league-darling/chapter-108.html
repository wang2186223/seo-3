                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m begging you, get here as fast as you can!Things could take a very dark turn if you don&#39;t!&#34;Caiden&#39;s desperate plea crackled through the phone line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending doctor had rarely encountered such raw vulnerability-a father who seemed shattered, unsure of where to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Caiden dabbed at his eyes,briefly masking his sorrow before facing the doctor.&#34;My daughter will be here shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then dialed his home number again, seeking some comfort or update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence greeted him-no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed and anxious, he switched tactics and called Joyce.Over the years,he had indulged her every whim,sparing no expense for her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, amidst the turmoil, he expected her to rise to the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was Katrina who had entangled themin this  disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover,he needed Joyce to bring a substantial sum of money. In his haste to reach the hospital, he had managed only to bring five hundred dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang several times before Joyce picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, I&#39;m at the hospital. We need fifty thousand dollars. Ronald requires surgery, and Wyatt and Mom need to be hospitalized immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Joyce sighed dramatically,her tone laced with exasperation. &#34;Dad, Mom has the safe key,so I can&#39;t access the money. I&#39;m not going to that hospital. It&#39;s full of sickness and bacteria, and as someone who&#39;s pregnant, I&#39;d think my health would be a priority!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of helplessness swept over Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Joyce went on, &#34;Dad, you really should come home too. Mom&#39;s incredibly upset.There&#39;s little you can help there. It&#39;s probably best to employ a nurse-they&#39;ll mnanage everything far more effectively than you. Plus, Mom blames the entire ordeal on them, insisting it&#39;s none of our concern.&#34; Initially, Joyce had felt a twinge of anxiety when the chaos erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as the minutes passed without any police involvement, her womy dissipated, giving way toindifference</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a deep ache in his chest as he absorbedher dismissive tone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, he had lavished Joyce with affectionand gifts, often at the expense of Daniela, whoreceived scant attention from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, in his time of need, Daniela rushed to his aidafter just a simple call Joyce, conversely, offerednothing but weak justifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stop talking like that, Joyce,&#34; Caiden retorted sharplyThey&#39;re still family, and tuming our backs on them iscruel. Or do you enjoy watching them struggle fortheir lives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sprawled on the couch, an apple in hand. Joyce rolledher eyes and huffed, &#34;That&#39;s their dilemma. not mine.If it&#39;s help you need, go to Daniela. She&#39;s always readyto play the martyr.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s fingers dug into his phone, his face growingalarmingly pale, as if all the blood had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could utter another word, Joyce ended thecall abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A profound sorrow enveloped him This was the family he had cherished for over a decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no alternatives, Caiden hastily summoned a taxi to take him home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his arrival, finding Katrina absent, he reluctantly turned to Joyce to request financial help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of reluctance in her voice, Joyce stated,&#34;Fine,but consider this a loan. You&#39;re going to have to repay me-with interest. Family or not, money is money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then proceeded to transfer ten thousand dollars to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he confirmed the transaction, Caiden inadvertently saw the balance in her account-a startling number of zeros trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been providing Katrina and Joyce a lavish monthly allowance, which accumulated to over a million dollars a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, at his timne of need, one had vanished, and the other grudgingly handed over merely a fraction of her wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a profound sense of poverty wash over him. On his somber journey back to the hospital, he mused bitterly that depending on Joyce had been a futile hope all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his arrival, he found Daniela already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hospital staff delineated the steep expenses involved, Caiden, who had previously never been troubled by financial concerns, shut his eyes in bitter disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton, overwhelmed by the sum mentioned,dissolved into tears. &#34;We can&#39;t pay for the treatment.Just let me go already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the distress filling the room, Daniela stepped outside to the doctor and inquired, &#34;Can you tell me exactly what the situation is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After piecing everything together, she made a brief phone call. Returning to Caiden, she announced, &#34;A top-notch surgeon will oversee the surgery. He&#39;s reviewed the scans and sees no significant concerns.He arrives tonight, will rest tomorrow morning,and is scheduled for the procedure in the afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s shoulders dropped as he exhaled deeply, a visible weight lifted by the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wyatt and Peyton don&#39;t have any major problems-they just require proper care,&#34; Daniela stated, her voice unwavering. &#34;Unless there&#39;s anything else, I&#39;ll take my leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she strode towards the exit, Caiden tagged along behind her, his steps uncertain. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing by her car, Daniela faced him with a stern expression. &#34;The financials are your responsibility.They never showed me consideration, so why should I bear the cost? You&#39;ll manage, I&#39;m certain. Besides,this hospital belongs to a friend of mine. I&#39;ve already discussed it with them. You have five days to arrange the payment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, she slid into her car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock struck 1 a.m., and a gentle rain began to patter against the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the hospital, Caiden stood rooted to the spot,overwhelmed by a sudden surge of regret. His hands flew to his face as tears escaped, mourning the years lost and the estrangement that had grown between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had it come to this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he allowed the little girl who once called him &#34;Daddy&#34; to become so estranged?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the hospital room, Peyton&#39;s eyes burned with  anger as he confronted Caiden. &#34;You&#39;re the reason Daniela&#39;s done with us! She doesn&#39;t give a damn about this family anymore, and it&#39;s all thanks to you!&#34;</p>
