                <p>Daniela was anticipating Caiden&#39;s eruption into the fray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Caiden cast a brief glance at Daniela, who was observing the commotion with her chin resting on her hand, and addressed Katrina with unexpected composure. &#34;What the hell is wrong with you? Get off the ground and stop embarrassing yourself like a goddamn idiot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, her expression icy and detached, overheard every word clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Lillian leaned towards Ryan and murmured, &#34;Caiden&#39;s behavioris peculiar today, isn&#39;tit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering towards Daniela, Ryan nodded and whispered back, &#34;Ever since that sketchbook disappeared,Daniela has been in a foul temper. She doesn&#39;t give a damn about anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Katrina that her theatrics were futile.Daniela was merely a spectator to her disgrace,entirely uninvolved and unresponsive. Leaving now would just make her a loser walking away with empty hands.She picked herself up, yanked Caiden aside, and wpedher tears away forcefully, &#34;Caiden! Cut the crap andtell me what the hell is your problem? Daniela ruinedmy daughter&#39;s marriage, it&#39;s her or me today! Youneed to confront her and demand justice for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Caiden remained still, giving nothingаwаy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice escalated, tears streaming anew, &#34;Fine!If you won&#39;t defend me, we might as well divorce!We&#39;ll split everything, Half for you, half for me. Wththat, the Bennett family will certainly welcome mydaughter with open arms!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden froze for a moment, stunned that Katrine hedthe nerve to stake a claim on half his wealth,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in surprise, and as he gaped at herKatrina&#39;s voice softened a touch, &#34;Don&#39;t give me tha!look, and let&#39;s not revisit how the Harper family&#39;sfortune was eamed by Bree, I&#39;m your wife nowCaiden, What belongs to you also belongs to me. l&#39;mnot picking a fight, but Daniela&#39;s gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s belly was visibly growing day by day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander wouldn&#39;t mary her, was her fate to bewth a man once maried?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere idea sent a shiver down her spine, Observing the resolve in Katrina&#39;s expression, Caiden conceded,&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina exhaled a quiet breath of relief, reassured by her belief that Caiden wouldn&#39;t leave her-not when no one else could match her unwavering support for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in slightly, her tone laced with reassurance.&#34;Honey, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t cause a scene. I&#39;ll simply ask her about it, and if Daniela isn&#39;t involved, I&#39;ll apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden barely looked up, his voice devoid of emotion.&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Katrina turned on her heel and marched back to the building, her steps echoing with resolve and a touch of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! Come out! We need to talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela emerged, her presence icy. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes blazed with fury as she snapped,&#34;Was it you who wrecked Alexander and Joyce&#39;s marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she pressed on.&#34;Tell me,did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Katrina raised her hand in a threatening  gesture, but before it could strike, Daniela looked up sharply, her intense eyes locking with Katrina&#39;s in a silent challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart fluttered unexpectedly, causing her raised hand to pause mid-air before retreating to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What bullshit are you even saying?&#34; Daniela&#39;s lips twisted into a subtle smile, her eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and challenge as she faced Katrina.&#34;Give me a break. You&#39;re throwing out accusations like a fool. Show me some proof or get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What proof is necessary when it&#39;s clear as day it was you? Why else would the Bennett family go back on their word? They were committed to the wedding just after New Year&#39;s! Is this your way of getting back at us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her expression thoughtful yet mocking. &#34;Interesting theory. So, tell me, what am l supposedly avenging? What kind of shit do you think I care enough about to get revenge for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Katrina faltered, her eyes darting nervously.&#34;You were once married to Alexander, and Joyce has already apologized for that incident at the fire. What more do you want from her? Daniela,let bygones be bygones!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile turned frosty, her tone dripping with  sarcasm. &#34;Let bygones be bygones? So, you beg for mercy when you screw up, but when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s tum, you never let them live it down. Real classy of you, Katrina. And let me make one thing clear-if you&#39;re so desperate, feel free to scoop up the trash l toss out, but leave my name out of your pathetic games. I don&#39;t deal with leftovers. Oh, and one more thing. Your family really does have a thing for scraps,don&#39;t they? Just because Joyce is desperate enough to hang on to Alexander doesn&#39;t mean I give a damn.Do me a favor and keep your filthy drama to yourself -I can&#39;t stomach that disgusting crap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt those words like a punch to the gut,knocking the air right out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult didn&#39;t just wound Joyce; it deeply affected Katrina and Caiden as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a side of Daniela they had never witnessed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, esteemed for her principled conduct and seldom seen engaging in disputes, had always appeared aloof, often ignoring petty squabbles and dismissive of the gossip swirled around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, no one had ever seen her display such vehement anger. Without a moment&#39;s pause, Daniela whipped out her phone and dialed Alexander&#39;s number, right there in front of the entire Harper family and an increasingly curious circle of bystanders. She then activated the speakerphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their divorce, Daniela had never once reached out to Alexander first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden call took him by surprise, and his voice,tinged with unexpected warmth, didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Katrina, who watched with a frosty glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,Daniela.&#34;</p>
