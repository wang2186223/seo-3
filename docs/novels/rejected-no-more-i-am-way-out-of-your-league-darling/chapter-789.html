                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face drained of color, his anger palpable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed the phone into its cradle, leaping from his seat and storming out of the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Hamilton shouted from the street beneath the building, his voice booming. &#34;Come down here!Explain yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers were taken aback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had they witnessed their father lose his composure like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had always seen Hamilton as cold, ruthless, and commanding-someone who kept others at arm&#39;s length. This kind of fury was unlike him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s shout was so thunderous that Cedric leaned out from an upper floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to trouble Daniela with this, he made his way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on Cedric as he approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Daniela appeared behind him. The McCoy family members looked at Daniela warily</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nonchalantly seated herself on a nearby sofa,raising a hand &#34;I&#39;m just here to watch how things play out You all carry on&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her casual tone, it was clear she wasn&#39;t there just for amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was there to stand by Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why else would she appear so stern? It was as if she were warning everyone not to cross her man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot Cedric a glare of frustration. &#34;You need to learn when to stop being so stubborn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, however, stayed unruffled. His indifference was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured to the seat opposite him. &#34;Mr. McCoy,take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he arranged seating for the others, including the secretary and lawyer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After handing Hamilton a glass of water, Cedric finally spoke. &#34;Mr. McCoy, if it&#39;s alright, I&#39;d like us to have an open and honest conversation,with your children here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face was a mask of tension, yet Cedric remained completely composed. &#34;I&#39;ve never truly had parents, nor did I ever expect to.I&#39;m not like others. I believe in earning everything myself. You&#39;re so certain I&#39;m your son, which must mean you&#39;ve had a DNA test done. To you, blood ties are important, but to me, they mean nothing. The day my grandmother brought me home from the orphanage, she became my only family Now, I also have a wife. And in the future, we&#39;ll have kids. They&#39;re my family, while the McCoy family isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve never sought anything from you, nor do I want my wife to be bound by any ties to you. I&#39;ve never used a single cent of your money, and I never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a slight smile. &#34;I&#39;m perfectly content with my surname and have no plans to change it.&#34; He looked at the McCoy brothers. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen you as my brothers. I&#39;m really quite indifferent and pragmatic.I don&#39;t waste time on those who don&#39;t treat me well or who have no connection to me. So, I hope you don&#39;t consider me part of the McCoy family moving forward,alright? I think I&#39;ve been clear enough today If you have any questions, let&#39;s get them out of the way now. I&#39;ve got plenty to do, and I don&#39;t want to waste time on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers were utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never imagined Cedric would be so blunt,outright rejecting their wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their attention turned to Daniela, who sat quietly sipping coffee, absorbed in her phone, without so much as glancing up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face reddened with fury. &#34;Cedric! What are you talking about? No connection to the McCoy family? You&#39;re my flesh and blood! You&#39;ll always be my son! How can you claim you have no ties to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt his control slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, do you even realize what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confident, commanding Hamilton was now as rattled as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand the idea of someone dismissing his immense wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t accept that Cedric genuinely didn&#39;t care about the McCoy family, didn&#39;t care about him as a father, or the millions tied to their name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was on the brink of losing control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you have to realize that opportunities like this don&#39;t come often. Becoming part of the McCoy family is about more than just a title-it&#39;s everything. Are you really ready to walk away from all of it?&#34; Nikolas was baffled by Cedric&#39;s position. &#34;Are you truly prepared to give it all up?&#34; Cedric had said countless times that he didn&#39;t care about the McCoy family&#39;s wealth, but no one had ever believed him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all assumed it was just a strategy so that they wouldn&#39;t make him a target</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they had no choice but to accept that Cedric had no intention of joining the McCoy family</p>
