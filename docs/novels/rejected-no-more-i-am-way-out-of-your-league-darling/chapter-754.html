                <p>As Daniela hit the play button, Nikolas&#39; voice echoed through the microphone, his words unmistakable and emphatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! If I lose, I&#39;H crawl and bark like a dog in front of everyone. But if you lose, you have to admit to everyone that you&#39;re nothing but a crazy woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An immediate hush descended upon the previously lively crowd as the recording rolled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes shifted to Daniela and Nikolas in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broadcast camera promptly focused on Nikolas&#39; expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathered crowd was eager to witness how Nikolas, the once-presumed heir of the McCoy dynasty,would handle the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat broke out on the secretary, chilling him as tension mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he going to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had attempted to whisk Nikolas away just moments earlier, hoping to avert this disaster, but Daniela&#39;s decision to air the recording left them no avenue for escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trapped by his own words, Nikolas faced a dire choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should he fail to follow through with his wild claim, his reputation for honesty, crucial for a leader in business,would crumble publicly.How would McCoy Group maintain trust without its leader&#39;s credibility?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, if he were to perform the humiliating act, surrendering his dignity in the view of countless onlookers,could he still wield authority? With his status undermined, could he possibly claim his place as the heir?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of his decision to bark or not, Nikolas faced a disastrous outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paralyzed by the sudden clarity, Nikolas stood immobile. His gaze shifted from Daniela to the reporters, then to the live stream displayed on the expansive screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confident of his victory, he had personally ensured every journalist in Oiscoll was present and had even orchestrated the live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by the multitude, Nikolas found himself unable to think. He pivoted rigidly towards his father&#39;s secretary.&#34;Joseph...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph appeared deeply distressed. He ignored Nikolas, approaching Daniela instead. He turned away from the camera lenses, his voice urgent but hushed. &#34;Ms. Harper, surely we can avoid further conflict. We&#39;re not enemies here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The power to end this debacle lay solely with Daniela, the only one who could spare Nikolas from utter humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, it was a lapse in judgment by Nikolas. Given the crowd gathered here, perhaps you could consider letting this incident pass?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, arms folded, watched Nikolas from across the space. His stare was lethal, filled with suppressed rage, as if he were a predator in the darkness, poised for attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to be biding his time, waiting forthe noise to die down before unleashing his wrath on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such disgrace was unprecedented in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an affront he had never encountered before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had made up his mind-Daniela had to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stayed quiet, Joseph tried to get Nikolas to own up. But the glare Nikolas shot back stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph leaned in close, his voice sharp but hushed.&#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t seem like the kind to blow things out of proportion. Just admit you messed up. You can handle the rest once everyone&#39;s calmed down. Unless you&#39;re actually planning to get down on all fours and bark in public.&#34; Nikolas clenched his jaw. &#34;Joseph, if I cave now, she&#39;s going to keep stepping on me every chance she gets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stared at him, utterly lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a half-laugh and glanced at Joseph. &#34;Well, it seems he&#39;s not ready to be reasoned with. In that case...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the microphone, fingers already tightening around the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; said Joseph, thrusting his phone into Daniela&#39;s hand.&#34;Mr. McCoy&#39;s on the line. He wants to speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela accepted the phone and pressed it to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice came through steady and low.&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed silent, eyes fixed ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Hamilton continued, &#34;Nikolas and Cedric are brothers. Nikolas has suffered enough humiliation today.Dragging this out helps no one, especially not Cedric. Like it or not, he&#39;s still one of us.You wouldn&#39;t want to be the reason this whole family gets dragged through the mud,would you? | know you&#39;re strong, and I know Cedric leans on you more than anyone. But no matter how tough we are, people still need family. This one&#39;s on Nikolas, and I&#39;ll take care of it. There are too many eyes on us right now. Let it go-for my sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word came from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton added, &#34;Since Nikolas is the one who messed up, it&#39;s only right that we take responsibility.I understand you&#39;re here in Oiscoll to dig into that explosion from years back. If you&#39;re willing to let this situation go, I&#39;ll open every door in McCoy Group for you. No strings attached.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An arch of the brow was Daniela&#39;s only response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet laugh, Hamilton added, &#34;Relax. This is between the two of us. Cedric&#39;s got nothing to do  with it.I&#39;m keeping him out of this. Then the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lost it. &#34;Daniela! I don&#39;t care what my father promised you. I won&#39;t stand for it! I&#39;m not letting you anywhere near McCoy Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him with a calm, knowing smile. &#34;You don&#39;t get to make that decision. You&#39;re not in charge yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she lifted the mic again, turned to the crowd, and smiled. &#34;Just a little entertainment, everyone. That&#39;s all it was. We&#39;re done here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience sank into a hush, their disappointment heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela passed the microphone to the nearest person and turned to Nikolas. &#34;I can only imagine how often your father lies awake at night, wondering how he ended up with a son as brainless as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That struck a nerve. Nikolas flew into a rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think that&#39;s funny? Say it again, I dare you! I swear, I&#39;m going to kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the confrontation seemed to be over, the reporters kept their cameras aimed and recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So in the end, what did everyone see? Daniela showed him mercy. And what did Nikolas do with it? He tried to get back at her. No gratitude.Just violence.</p>
