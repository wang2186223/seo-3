                <p>Hamilton stormed over in a rush the moment he heard his siblings had come to see Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela was checking out the ginseng when Hamilton barged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get inside?&#34; Daniela asked, recalling Cedric&#39;s strict orders to the guards-no strangers allowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The guards wouldn&#39;t let me in, so my men clashed with them. Someone tried blocking me, but I told them I&#39;m Cedric&#39;s father. They stepped aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could only stare at him, speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton snatched the ginseng from her hands and tossed it in the trash. &#34;This junk isn&#39;t good enough for my grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jabbed a finge at the hallway. &#34;I already had proper supplements sent over. They&#39;re by the door.Where&#39;s Cedric? If he&#39;s so worried, he can see for himself. You think I&#39;d poison my own grandson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While ranting, Hamilton spotted a toy sitting nearby-the one Jules had sent. &#34;Bet this is from Jules.Miserly fool! Who sends cheap junk like this? Safe? It might be toxic. Toss it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a clatter, the toy joined the ginseng in the bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his home, Jules, listening in, froze when he heard the crash before the line cut out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was stunned. That toy cost a fortune,handpicked.How dare Hamilton call it worthless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes fell on the supplements on the table.He let out a mocking snort. &#34;This must be Ethan&#39;s work-made in his company. Nobody trusts his products. He gave this to my grandson? What do they want, a fool for a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another loud thud, the supplements hit the trash too. Daniela sat back on the couch, watching Hamilton stand there, hands on hips, acting like he ruled the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked in right then. Hamilton turned on him at once. &#34;Tell me, why are you turning away my gifts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped into the kitchen, pulled some oranges from the fridge, and rinsed them under the tap. &#34;I don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s gifts,&#34; he said flatly.He glanced toward the living room, spotted the gifts tossed in the trash, then turned away. &#34;This ends here. Don&#39;t show up without warning again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scowled, ready to snap back, but Cedric dropped the clean oranges into the juicer instead.Juice poured steadily into a glass beneath the spout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How am I uninvited? Daniela&#39;s carrying my grandson. I have every right to check on them.What&#39;s so wrong about that?&#34; Hamilton said, lifting his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed unmoved.&#34;It&#39;s wrong.Stay away. Hamilton sucked in a breath, baffled at how stubborn his son had turned out. He shifted his gaze to Daniela, hoping she&#39;d take his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling opposite Daniela, Hamilton flicked a look at her laptop and muttered, &#34;Staring at screens too long can harm the baby, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely looked up from McCoy Group&#39;s real-time charts. Her voice stayed calm. &#34;Oh? Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Hamilton&#39;s life, only his father had ignored him this much. Now, even Daniela did it without blinking.Oddly enough, he found himself getting used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing his legs, Hamilton fixed his eyes on her,a touch of drama in his pose. &#34;Tell Cedric to stop blocking me from coming here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Daniela, Hamilton just seemed overly persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t acknowledge him, but it didn&#39;t matter.Hamilton&#39;s confidence stayed untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what Cedric said or did, he was still his son-nothing would change that. Even after cutting Nikolas off in public, Hamilton stil lectured him like a father and never shut the door completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas never questioned it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was just how the McCoys operated-things went unsaid but were understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Daniela didn&#39;t waste time correcting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dealing with that kind of logic wasn&#39;t something she had energy for, especially now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re asking the wrong person. I don&#39;t make calls on family matters.&#34; As she spoke, Daniela pulled up McCoy Group&#39;s system and sifted through the financial reports. The drop in profits was clearly reflected on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t notice. His eyes stayed on her.&#34;You&#39;re exaggerating. Doesn&#39;t Cedric do what you say? If you asked him, wouldn&#39;t he agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head while snapping screenshots and forwarding them to the agency. &#34;You&#39;re mistaken. He doesn&#39;t listen to me when it comes to things like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Hamilton, it sounded like Daniela was brushing him off. His face grew cold with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up and saw him sulking in the corner. A small smile tugged at her lips. &#34;Believe me or not, it&#39;s true. I handle a lot around here, but this isn&#39;t my call.&#34;</p>
