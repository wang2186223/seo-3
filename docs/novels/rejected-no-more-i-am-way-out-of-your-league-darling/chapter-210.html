                <p>Daniela&#39;s smirk carried a hint of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden caught it and felt a sting, yet he reminded himself of the stakes involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hundreds of millions were on the line here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that amount locked in, Harper Group could thrive again, leaving him to sit back and enjoy the incoming profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you planning to put the money into the company tomorrow?&#34; Caiden asked, his eyes alight with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Daniela responded without hesitation. Elated, Caiden was just about to dash upstairs to relay the thrilling news to Katrina when Daniela&#39;s next words halted him. &#34;I&#39;m planning to put in a billion, and based on our current share distribution, you&#39;ll need to match nearly that amouunt. When can we expect your contribution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s smile abruptly solidified on his face. He swiveled, disbelief etched across his features. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,what was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a nonchalant smile.&#34;What? Are you having second thoughts about investing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had not foreseen Daniela raising the topic of additional funds; he had assumed she would simply inject the money herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not required to contribut111Daniela continued calmly. Relief washed over Caiden, and he was just about to express his agreement when she added, &#34;However, should I invest such a hefty sum alone, it would inevitably dilute your shares to the point where Harper Group might slip from your grasp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lingered in the air, and before Caiden could muster a response, Katrina burst into the scene from upstairs. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re so utterly ruthless! Are you aiming to seize complete control of Harper Group?&#34; Katrina accused her sharply, her tone frigid with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela played along, her voice dripping with sarcasm, &#34;Ruthless? Wasn&#39;t it you who begged me to invest?And now you&#39;re calling me ruthless for following through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face flushed a deep crimson. He stumbled over his words. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it like that. I just meant for you to contribute the cash, nothing more. Not to bring in any investment funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reply was laced with a biting edge.&#34;Ah, so you expect something for nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck a sharp chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth in her statement was harsh but inescapable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s lips tightened, and he found himself momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression shifted from a frown to a look of understanding. She tried to smooth things over.&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re misunderstanding your father. We never intended to exploit you. It&#39;s just that our business has been struggling, and profits are down. Your father wanted to secure dowries for you and Joyce,but his investments backfired. Now, our finances are in ruins. We&#39;ve resorted to eating patatoes daily. Joyce and l are accustomed to living modestly, but your father, having been pampered all his life, finds this lifestyle unbearable. You might not hold much love for Joyce and me, but Caiden is your father by blood. You wouldn&#39;t want to see him suffer, would you? We&#39;re family after all. Why should there be any boundaries among us? By investing in Harper Group, you&#39;d be supporting your father. Doesn&#39;t that make sense to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Cedric&#39;s frown deepened as he listened. His voice was icy as he cut in,&#34;So what is it really-an investment, or just financial support for the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was blatantly obvious this was just,ascheme to extort money by exploiting Caiden&#39;s predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,still a relatively young man, was already entangled in conversations about support payments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was poised to interject, but Daniela cut her off. &#34;I recall you formally ended our father-daughter relationship. So, why are we discussing support now?&#34; The memory of the slap Caiden had delivered to Daniela lingered vividly in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was astonishing that he dared to seek financial aid after everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was filled with profound regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he had foreseen these circumstances, he would have never let go of his paternal bond with Daniela!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,stripped of any justification, he shot Katrina a look filled with frustration and silent accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the family drama unfolded before her, Daniela remained disinterested in further debate. She stated plainly, &#34;I&#39;m sticking to my original stance. Yes, I can provide the funds. Consider it either an investment or a loan. Should it be a loan, I expect monthly repayments-no exceptions. I&#39;m exhausted; let me know your decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Daniela retreated upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice, steeped in irritation, resonated through the room after her departure. &#34;See, I warned you about pushing too hard. Daniela has the means and the willingness to help, yet she has no obligation to.She&#39;s not my legal daughter anymore. This mess is on you. If only I had known, I would have never agreed to your plan. One mistake just leads to another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina vented her frustration, lamenting, &#34;How could I have guessed Daniela would turn out to be so adept?You&#39;re her father, and yet, you pale in comparison to her. She&#39;s amassing wealth, while what do we have?Day after day, you leave me and Joyce surviving on nothing but potatoes. Doesn&#39;t that embarrass you? Even poor Jack has to endure this misery with us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden noticed Cedric hadn&#39;t left the room. His gaze was sardonic, his demeanor detached and frosty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cunning glint sparked in Caiden&#39;s eyes as he broached an offer.&#34;Cedric, I&#39;m aware of the ongoing issues you have with Daniela. How about reconsidering my earlier proposal? The secret to gaining her favor, now just for fifty million-a real steal. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wrestled with a palpable temptation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, observing Cedric&#39;s hesitance, pushed confidently. &#34;Well? At fifty million, it&#39;s a steal. Don&#39;t want it? I&#39;ll find someone who does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, pointing upwards, made it clear.′′Myfinances are under Daniela&#39;s control. She calls the shots on how it&#39;s spent, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression darkened as he silently berated Cedric&#39;s lack of backbone and his susceptibility to Daniela&#39;s influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric turned to leave, he paused briefly, his tone even and measured. &#34;I&#39;d suggest you hold off on selling that secret. You know her reach. If she discovers your scheming, she won&#39;t hesitate to gain full control of Harper Group, and that will be the end for you.&#34;</p>
