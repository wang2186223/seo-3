                <p>Daniela&#39;s words lingered in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was fuming with rage, on the brink of losing control</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood rooted, nearly at the point of attacking Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was without a mother. How could she be so arrogant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s none of your business,&#34; Elyse snapped.her anger matching her rage not to provoke Daniela further. &#34;Natalie chose to be with Linden on her own:it&#39;s none of your concern,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed. &#34;Is that so? If I remember correctly.Natalie previously scoffed at Linden. So, she acts as if she hates him yet secretly loves him? Natalie,you have feelings for Linden, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she spoke, Linden, who was just entering the room, gave a scheming grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a deep breath, preparing herself to confront Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Natalie is somewhat shy, but she indeed has feelings for Linden,&#34; Elyse confirmed. Daniela looked directly at Natalie. &#34;Really? Natalie,do you really have feelings for Linden? Should I set you up with him? What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her teeth. &#34;There&#39;s no need for you to intervene,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her response, the smile slowly disappeared from Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Is that so? Then perhaps I&#39;m overstepping. If that&#39;s the case, I won&#39;t intervene in your issues either,Aunt Elyse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please!&#34; Elyse instantly became desperate. &#34;Daniela,we&#39;re family,the closest there is. I&#39;m your aunt, and I&#39;m facing troubles; how can you turn me away? Daniela.I have no one else but you to depend on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Elyse approached Linden with a smile and placed his hand on Natalie&#39;s. &#34;I support this marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grinned.&#34;An ideal pair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Daniela&#39;s office, Natalie was fuming, and on the verge of exploding. &#34;What&#39;s the meaning of this, Mom?&#34;Is your daughter really just a pawn in your game? You&#39;re selling me off to this jerk for your own sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie spoke harshly, completely ignoring Linden&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What other choice did I have? Do you really think l wanted this? If we hadn&#39;t agreed, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have given us the money. So. who would have paid off the huge debt from the hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden,leaning against the wall, observed the two women as they plotted and strategized, only to realize their helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never understood that they were outmatched by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fed up with the scene.Linden walked over and pulled Natalie away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie exclaimed in surprise, &#34;What exactly are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden smirked, a hint of mischief on his lips. &#34;What does it look like I&#39;m doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer to Natalie, breathing warm air onto her face. As she flinched. Linden leaned in and whispered,&#34;Fuck you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie fought back with all her strength,urging Elyse to step in and offer her help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the CEO&#39;s office door swung open,and Daniela appeared at the far end of the corridor.watching the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she felt Daniela&#39;s gaze on her, Elyse&#39;s grip on Natalie&#39;s hand loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of fear washed over Natalie. She tightened htdrhiete bond Daniela looked on in silence, a subtle smile curving her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head at Elyse, tears streaming down her cheeks. &#34;Mom, please don&#39;t let him take me. You know what he&#39;ll do. I can&#39;t go with Linden. Please help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s voice was thick with despair as she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes welled with tears. However, she quickly pulled her hand away from Natalie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden laughed as he pulled Natalie towards the elevator,making their movement obvious to everyone in the secretarial department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the elevator doors began io close, he lifted Natalie&#39;s shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie screamed in terror. Linden kissed her forcefully,fully aware of the eyes watching them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse watched everything, shutting her eyes in surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slowly closed, Linden&#39;s hand moved lower, and Natalie, overwhelmed by the situation,closed her eyes in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bystanders gasped, their disdain for Elyse and Natalie intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had the power to rescue her daughter. Had she intervened,Daniela would have commanded Linden to  stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there no escape for Natalie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually,there was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had dialed the police right there. Linden would have given up without a fight, but Natalie chose not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her act of closing her eyes signified surrendering to her fate, overwhelmed by financial burdens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched everything, her lips curling into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was far from enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nowhere near enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the complete ruin of those involved could ever make up for the loss of her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had been taken too soon, and those responsible would not be easily let off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse wiped at the tears near her lips, turning to Daniela with a wide grin. &#34;Daniela, you see? They&#39;re a perfect match. Daniela, all those previous issues were just misunderstandings. Now, about the retirement home you promised,when will I get it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sacrificing Natalie&#39;s future for wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was mildly entertained. &#34;What I promised, I&#39;ll certainly fulfill. Aunt Elyse, since Natalie and Linden seem so taken with each other, when are they planning to get married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face shifted to one of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting married?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fling was something that held no real importance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie rose to power, who would still recall her past mistakes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But marriage was a different matter entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A married status would bind Natalie to Linden forever.</p>
