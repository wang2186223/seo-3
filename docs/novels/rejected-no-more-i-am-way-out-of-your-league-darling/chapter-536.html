                <p>Cedric chuckled lightly, his amusement barely concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight men across from him remained stiff, their gazes locked on Cedric&#39;s lips, bracing themselves for whatever shocking words might follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Cedric raised a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men opposite him stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their expressions turned blank, shock flooding their features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you mean ten million?&#34; Bruno asked, his voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s fingers tightened around his water glass as he forced a strained chuckle. &#34;Ten million for each of us.Nothing we can&#39;t handle,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett,sitting to the side,found his smile faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Cedric remained silent. He knew these old foxes weren&#39;t confused-they were just buying time. But in the end, they would have to accept the reality before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s feigned pleasantness gave way to a scowl.&#34;Mr. Phillips, just what exactly are you playing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded with cool indifference, &#34;I believe I&#39;ve made myself quite clear,haven&#39;tl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett lowered his gaze. &#34;A hundred billion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled lightly. &#34;If that sounds low to you,feel free to increase the amount. For a project of this scale, a hundred billion is merely the baseline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished speaking, the eight men collectively shut their eyes, inhaling sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hundred billion?&#34; Bruno erupted, slamming the table as he shot to his feet. &#34;Are you out of your mind?You trying to drive us all into bankruptcy? This is extortion! Do you really think we fear you? We showed up here today out of courtesy, and yet you have the nerve to push things this far? Do you actually believe you can dominate the entire business world on your own? Let me tell you something-you&#39;d better take ths two hundred million while it&#39;s still on the table. Otherwise, soon enough, you might not even get that much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno was shaking with rage, his face contorted with fury. But Cedric remained as composed as ever. &#34;If you think it&#39;s too much, then we have nothing more to discuss. We&#39;ll manage just fine on our own.Our fifteen minutes are up. Daniela, shall we take that walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose to her feet, slipping her hand into Cedric&#39;s as they walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight men sat frozen, their expressions blank with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey blinked in disbelief. &#34;They just walked out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley frowned. &#34;Not even a chance to negotiate?What the hell was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett spun towards Bruno, eyes blazing. &#34;Are you insane? Why the hell did you lose it? We&#39;re already at a disadvantage. Did you forget why we came here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno clenched his teeth. &#34;Did you not see Cedric&#39;s greed? A hundred billion! He&#39;s trying to bleed us dry!And Daniela-did you catch that glare she gave me?That gold digger! Who the hell does she think she is?Just because her husband&#39;s got power, she thinks she can look down on us? She actually thinks she&#39;s something, huh? Yet when it came down to it, she didn&#39;t even have the guts to speak. The richest person in the world? What a complete joke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice boomed, cutting through the air and echoing across the lobby. Hackett yanked at Bruno&#39;s sleeve, trying to rein him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno jerked his arm free, seething. &#34;I want them to hear! They&#39;re nobodies! Daniela? The richest person in the world? Not even close!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left his mouth, the figures near the exit halted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat later, Cedric turned his head, his gaze cutting through the room like a blade, locking onto the eight men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno stiffened, his bluster faltering under Cedric&#39;s icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Bruno stuttered, watching Cedric and Daniela disappear. His frustration boiled over. &#34;Did you see that? What was that attitude? So damn arrogant!Shouldn&#39;t we put them in their place?&#34; His voice rang out,still loud and indignant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, Lillian, and Nina stood nearby, arms crossed,their gazes turning sharp and icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their stroll, Lillian eyed the snack in Daniela&#39;s hand and asked, &#34;Daniela, is it time to start the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the three fuming faces before her,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a small smile playing on her lips. &#34;That mad,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan clenched his jaw. &#34;Absolutely!&#34; Nina huffed. &#34;Furious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, nodding. &#34;Seems about time. Let&#39;s pick one of the eight to test the waters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she said that, the three instantly answered in unison, &#34;Bruno Deleon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised a brow, surprised. Then, she heard Cedric spat, &#34;Bruno Deleon.&#34;</p>
