                <p>Milo wrapped up the conversation and strolled off, exuding confidence with a self-assured smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her head, Daniela noticed Cedric&#39;s car already waiting at the side, and slid into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, his voice low, remarked, &#34;That guy was flirting with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a statement, not a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot Cedric a glance and smiled. He had a habit of getting jealous, and she secretly found it endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, Lillian jumped in, her voice brimming with curiosity. &#34;Daniela, I heard Milo charges fifty grand a night for his company. If he&#39;s willing to waive that for you, isn&#39;t that a pretty swreet deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet chuckle, her eyes flicking to Cedric&#39;s visibly sour expression. &#34;That&#39;s true. But I prefer things that retain their value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she transferred ten million to Cedric. &#34;I&#39;d rather invest in a truly expensive man,like one worth ten million a night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s phone vibrated, and when he checked it, he saw a notification confirming a ten-million-dollar deposit into his account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned forward to peek at Cedric&#39;s screen, then groaned dramatically.&#34;Ugh, you two lovebirds are unbearable! Let me out of the car-I can&#39;t handle all this PDA!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned the wheel with a grin that stretched from ear to ear, unable to hide his slelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Daniela realized she had discovered a fresh reason to work hard and earn more money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found that teasing Cedric was a surprisingly enjoyable hobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she didn&#39;t care much for indulging herself, she genuinely enjoyed spoiling Cedric. Standing at a distance, Joyce saw Milo deep in conversation with Danlela. But he wouldn&#39;t let her approach,so she could only watch with longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing Alexander to Dániela, Joyce couldn&#39;t shake the fear that Milo might also slip through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of how to keep his attention, she resorted to showering Milo with money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the borrowed cash soon dried up. By the time Joyce maxed out over a dozen credit cards, MAilo had disappeared from her life yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation left her in a state of extreme anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her dismay, she saw Milo standing beside her rival, Liza Alvarado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger boiled over, and she went to find Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bursting into the room, she yelled, &#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t care what it takes-you have to give me money right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,sitting in the living room with the TV on, didn&#39;t flinch. Her face remained calm and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or better yet, how much for those stocks?&#34; Joyce pressed. &#34;Just tell me how much, and I&#39;ll sell them to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sprang to her feet, her face flushed with anger, and slapped Joyce hard. &#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m crazy!&#34; Joyce shouted back. &#34;I need Milo in my life-he makes me feel aliv/e,like a real woman! I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep him! So, either you give me the money, or I&#39;m selling the shares. The choice is yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her outburst, Joyce turned her attention to Daniela, waiting for a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela realized this was the moment she had been anticipating. Smiling faintly, she asked, &#34;Joyce, have you forgotten? Those shares were a gift from mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce frowned,.confused.&#34;What do you mean? A gift can&#39;t be sold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan,seated quietly nearby, watched as Daniela deftly worked towards her desired outcome. &#34;The shares I gave you can&#39;t be sold,&#34; Daniela declared matter-of-factly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across Joyce&#39;s face. &#34;Why not?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained, &#34;Because they came with conditions. Imagine if you sold them to someone who could use them against me. I can&#39;t afford to leave myself vulnerable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen, unable to process what she had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela added, &#34;And about the dividends...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face went pale. She feared what Daniela would say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went on, &#34;Your mother told me not to distribute dividends to you. Since money shouldn&#39;t just sit idle,I reinvested it into the company&#39;s next research project. There won&#39;t be dividends for the next ten years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s jaw dropped in disbelief at Daniela&#39;s revelation. Snapping back to reality, she exclaimed, &#34;I only told you to withhold dividends temporarily, not to sink them into investments!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t be serious. This is company money. The funds have to be utilized, so as the majority shareholder,I reinvested them into research. It&#39;s a logical decision based on what you told me. Are you now trying to backtrack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit Katrina like a dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan watched in amazement from the sidelines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Daniela truly unaware of psychology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone so seemingly unaware be so skillful at psychological manipulation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, upon hearing everything, was on the verge of breaking down. She confronted Katrina, crying out,&#34;Mom! Why would you do that? Ten years with no dividends! You did it deliberately, didn&#39;t you? If I don&#39;t do what you want, you make my life a nightmare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce beat her chest with a loud thud. &#34;I&#39;m your daughter! Why are you doing this to me? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked as she screamed,&#34;Why?&#34; Katrina moved to explain, but Joyce shoved her away violently, &#34;You&#39;ve never treated me like your daughter.You&#39;ve only seen me as your puppet. You want to control me, to manipulate me for your entire life. If I don&#39;t follow your orders, you punish me without mercy. You&#39;re not my mother, not really. I can&#39;t stand it anymore. I never want to be under your control again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shook her head in desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce, in a fit of rage, shoved her once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force sent Katrina tumbling to the floor, her head hitting the steps, causing a painful crack and blood to start trickling down her temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, however, showed no concern. She glared at Katrina with a look of pure hatred, as though the woman on the floor wasn&#39;t her mother but a bitter enemy she could no longer tolerate.</p>
