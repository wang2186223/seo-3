                <p>Joyce&#39;s mind grappled with a sudden truth just before darkness overtook her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, too, was only human. She could lose control. She had someone she cared about, and that was Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization, Joyce slumped to the floor, unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian and Ryan returned from ther late meal to a surprising scene-Cedric holding Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you two, it&#39;s late. Maybe take the romance upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was poised to exit, but Cedric&#39;s voice halted her retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal with the mess down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Caiden, disturbed by the noise, descended in a hastily worn robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered the living room just as Cedric spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he noticed Joyce prone in a puddle of something odious, disgust flicked across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring everything, Cedric guided Daniela upstairs, their hands intertwined as though they were alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Daniela, Caiden recoiled instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wih her? Why the fury?&#34; Caiden murmured. &#34;Was she about to kill Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s intensity shook him, drawing the remark from him without thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing him, Daniela looked up from the intertwined hands of her and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood frozen, struggling to find words. Locked under Daniela&#39;s daunting gaze, as terrifying as a ghost from tales of old, he opened his mouth. But the malice in her eyes silenced him before he could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She advanced a single, menacing step towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Caiden hit the floor with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric drew Daniela closer with a gentle tug of her hand. Bending close, he murmured, &#34;Come on, honey.Let&#39;s go back to our room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, seeing her own reflection in Cedric&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then led her into their bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Caiden&#39;s heart raced until it finally calmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly recalled it wasn&#39;t the first time Daniela&#39;s eyes held that fierce look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Brylee passed away, whispers of her hysteria circulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These whispers morphed into wild rumors that Brylee had overdosed on aphrodisiacs, which led to her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was labeled a slut by many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Daniela didn&#39;t grasp the meaning of &#34;slut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Caiden, she tried to discern if the term was derogatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By that time, he had married Katrina and seemed indifferent to the slander about Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela matured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exceptionally intelligent, she advanced several grades, entering senior high at just ten</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among older peers, she frequently heard the careless slinging of the word &#34;slut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze then mirrored the intensity seen moments ago. One classmate&#39;s insult resulted in his own sustaining five broken ribs, a disfigured face from candle way,and deep emotional scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden fetched Daniela from school, the look in her eyes deterred him from any scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was fear, not affection, that silenced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ferocity in a ten-year-old&#39;s demeanor disturbed him deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s emotional turmõil eventually leveled out on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden chose not to dwell on the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only later he understood that Daniela&#39;s mood disorder flared due to that singular term.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This only occurred when something deeply affected her core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stared with a hardened gaze at the closed door of Daniela&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from Brylee, it seemed Cedric had become another crucial person in Daniela&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, Caiden expressed his frustration. &#34;Unbelievable. After all these years of my support, you&#39;ve never defended me as a daughter should. Joyce merely attempted to seduce Cedric, and he was unharmed.Was such a drastic reaction really necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs, he presumed Joyce had simply passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, upon noticing the vivid red marks encircling her neck, he stood frozen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan lingered by the threshold with a lazy stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Lillian was speaking on the phone. &#34;So, she&#39;s still alive, right? Should we take her to the hospital? If she were dead, I&#39;d just bury her here and save the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response from the other end caused Lillian to end the call in annoyance. She turned to Ryan. &#34;What if we just end her here? The hospital visit sounds tedious. We&#39;d need to wait for the car.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, absorbed in his phone, merely shrugged. &#34;Doesn&#39;t bother me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was taken aback by their indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, he declared, &#34;IH make the call. I&#39;ll take her myself. You two take a break. This is still about a human life. Let&#39;s not treat it so lightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, Caiden caught a glimpse of Lillian&#39;s mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Do you actually believe a life is that significant? That we should treat it with more care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing, Caiden sensed the implication in her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lillian moved past, she tapped Ryan on the shoulder. &#34;Let&#39;s head back to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entrance then quieted down abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden quickly phoned for an ambulance. As they helped Joyce to the ambulance, he realized she was completely exposed beneath her robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden gust of wind whipped the fabric away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Joyce was fully exposed to everyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One paramedic commented in dismay, &#34;We&#39;re here to save a life, not to be confronted by such a distasteful sight.&#34;</p>
