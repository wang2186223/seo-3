                <p>As Alexander entered with his luggage, Daniela gave a sharp clap, rising to her feet, her face as cold and distant as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the clock and stated calmly, &#34;It&#39;s 10:50 p.m. now. If the remaining funds aren&#39;t in by this time tomorrow, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and began to ascend the stairs at a deliberate pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s rage boiled over as he pointed at Daniela&#39;s retreating back, shouting,&#34;Daniela! You ungratefu brat! After everything I&#39;ve done for you, you expect me to pull this huge amount out of thin air? Are you trying to break me? Fine! If you want a choice, I&#39;ll pick prison! Call the cops, arrest me, I don&#39;t care! I&#39;m done with this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words echoed through the room, Daniela paused midway up the stairs, slowly turning to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an expression of innocent curiosity, Daniela looked down at him, her eyes wide and sincere, as if asking, &#34;Are you sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Caiden faltered, his bravado slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught in his throat, and he couldn&#39;t manage a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela vanished upstairs, Caiden exploded,his voice rising. &#34;Did you all see that? Did you see what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing with his hands on his hips, he seethed in frustration, pointing angrily at the stairs. &#34;This is the daughter l&#39;ve raised for over ten years. Look at her!She&#39;s just like Brylee-heartless. Now she wants to send me to the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Alexander, Caiden added bitterly, &#34;You were right all along. Daniela has no heart. Divorcing her was the right choice! Who knows what kind of chaos she&#39;d have caused your family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander observed with a chilling detachment,fully aware this was only the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had distanced herself from her family, then it would be her friends, and finally Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, she would find herself as isolated as she had been when she once pursued him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was biding his time, anticipating the day Daniela would return, groveling for his forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would face the consequences of her sharp words from today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina remained calm and pursed her lips before turning to Alexander. &#34;What do you think we should do? Daniela expects us to find this massive sum, all at once, and we...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot a meaningful look at Caiden before turning back to Alexander. &#34;We honestly can&#39;t manage it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying his luggage, Alexander inquired of a servant, &#34;Where is my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant gestured towards a guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded and turned to Katrina. &#34;This is between Caiden and Daniela. I&#39;ve divorced her, so I&#39;m not involved. It&#39;s getting late, so I&#39;m going to bed.Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he walked away, ignoring Katrina&#39;s desperate calls for him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened with frustration as she muttered,&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to marry Joyce? Shouldn&#39;t we handle this money problem together? The Bennett family surely has enough to cover this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the money was like asking Caiden to give up his very existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his shower, Caiden made his way to Alexander&#39;s door, knocking sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression remained neutral as he spoke. &#34;I&#39;ve spoken to my family about your situation. My father suggests we hold off on the engagement ceremony until things settle down. If Joyce marries me without a dowry, she&#39;ll be ridiculed by other families, especially with a child in the picture. My family isn&#39;t bothered, but you wouldn&#39;t want to see Joyce face that kind of embarrassment.My father thinks we should wait until the Harper family is back on solid ground, ensure Joyce has a proper dowry, and then he&#39;ll personally come to arrange the marriage with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut down Caiden&#39;s plans, effectively delaying the engagement until Harper Group was stable once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was, without a doubt, disastrous news for Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,however, seemed undisturbed. &#34;Living under the same roof, it&#39;s inevitable that feelings will grow.Once Joyce has Alexander&#39;s child, he&#39;l have no choice but to marry her.&#34; Caiden cast a glance at Alexander&#39;s door, his voice barely audible, &#34;Really? Do you think it&#39;ll go the way we planned?&#34;</p>
