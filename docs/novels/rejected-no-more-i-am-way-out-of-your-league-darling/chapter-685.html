                <p>Nikolas stood frozen, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw dropped, hanging there as if he&#39;d forgotten how to close it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once in his life had he heard Hamilton speak with such warmth, such unsettling friendliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, he studied Daniela&#39;s sharp profile, an uneasy weight settling in his chest-his position as heir had never felt so fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titles don&#39;t concern me,&#34; Daniela said coolly.&#34;Your actions, however, do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a challenge-clear, direct, and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Nikolas&#39; spine. He braced himself,fully expecting Hamilton&#39;s temper to erupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he stepped back, waiting for the inevitable-the phone slamming, the explosion of rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his shock, Hamilton didn&#39;t explode-he laughed. A rich, hearty laugh. &#34;It was just a test, no need to be so tense. Your reputation as Cealmaur&#39;s leader is well-earned. Even handling Ghost seemed effortless for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow lifted ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t done a thing to Ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Hamilton believed it, then Ghost must have made a move that afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who,then, had dealt with Ghost?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no answers, but she owed a silent debt to whoever had shielded Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, she played along, choosing to shieldthe unknown figure and feed Hamilton a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice remained steady, but the warning was razor-sharp. &#34;Make sure there isn&#39;t a next time,or Nikolas might not make it back to Oiscoll in one piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swallowed hard, lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, unbothered as ever, spoke like a doting elder, his voice smooth with a smile. &#34;Daniela,may l call you that? When will you and Cedric visit Oiscoll?I&#39;d love the pleasure of meeting you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The invitation was laid out, tempting yet laced with hidden intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t reckless enough to waltz into Hamilton&#39;s domain and hand him an advantage.&#34;We&#39;ll see. And one last thing-don&#39;t push Cedric into anything against his will. You won&#39;t like what happens if you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled, low and knowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was precisely the confirmation he had been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It proved what he had suspected all along-Daniela would go to any lengths for Cedric. Daniela wielded an empire of influence, razor-sharp business instincts, and a fortune vast enough to rival nations. A woman like that was the ideal successor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Cedric remained in Daniela&#39;s heart, the possibility of her joining the McCoy family was still on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the very start, Hamilton&#39;s sights had been set on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was no fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had drawn clear lines in the sand-Cedric was free to make his own choices, so long as he didn&#39;t endanger himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone won Hamilton&#39;s silent respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, Hamilton ended the call, his incompetent son standing there as if he&#39;d vanished into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gawked at the dead phone, his mind reeling,completely at a loss. &#34;Did you just hang up on my father?&#34; Nikolas stared at Daniela, utterly stunned. &#34;The last person who dared to do that is dead now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot him a knowing look. &#34;You&#39;re terrified of your father, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded. &#34;Obviously. He&#39;s the richest man on the planet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. &#34;So what? I once held that title too. Do I scare you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas instinctively wanted to say, &#34;You&#39;re scarier than my father!&#34; But he swallowed them back,unwilling to tempt fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he spoke, his voice quieter than before.&#34;So you&#39;re saying you won&#39;t meddle in Cedric&#39;s choices?As long as he isn&#39;t harmed, you&#39;ll stand by whatever he decides?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela inclined her head. &#34;Naturally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a dry chuckle. &#34;I figured you&#39;d play the &#39;for his own good&#39; card to keep him out of it.&#34; Daniela shook her head. &#34;That was never my plan. If he wants to fight, I&#39;ll stand behind him. If he doesn&#39;t,then that&#39;s his choice to make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since meeting her, Nikolas truly looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen plenty of high-born women, but Daniela eclipsed them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet it wasn&#39;t just her beauty-there was something else, an enigmatic pull, impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, he felt an unfamiliar pang-envy for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Cedric had Daniela-someone who stood by him, no strings attached, no conditions set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the warm hues of the setting sun, Daniela turned to Nikolas, her voice steady. &#34;To me, he&#39;s Cedric. No title, no name will ever change that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange warmth flickered in Nikolas&#39; chest. Before he could stop himself, a question slipped past his li</p>
