                <p>Cedric walked into the room and saw Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained composed, avoiding any interaction with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he found a chair and seated himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several women approached him, attempting to start a conversation. Everyone was aware that Daniela had lost her memories and their relationship was no longer the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambitious women were eager to take Daniela&#39;s place as Cedric&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A limp leg was no big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still a sharp businessman. Plus, he was undeniably handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, Alexander&#39;s surgically altered face has been ruined, but you were born handsome,&#34; one said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander is disgusting. He used your photo for his surgery. Now that he can&#39;t restore his old look, he got what he deserved,&#34; added another. Cedric remained uninterested in the gossip about Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was unfazed by the fact that someone had used his photo for plastic surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His focus was solely on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The socialites gathered around Cedric, but when they noticed his attention was fixed on Daniela, they gradually drifted away reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of them who were foolish enough to try winning him over began inching closer. But before they could make a move, Cedric rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They watched as he limped towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Cedric&#39;s perspective, the embarrassment of a limp was irrelevant. His only concern was Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you looking for?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was playing with her phone when a figure stood before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and saw Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed he wouldn&#39;t show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela always believed Cedric had high self-esteem Despite the numerous times she had embarrassed him,he never gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could sense his apprehension, but even after overcoming it, he still approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ask Caiden to look for something? Maybe l can help,&#34; Cedric said when Daniela didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Caiden walked over, a drink in hand.Despite his age, he radiated energy and youthfulness.&#34;The guy you mentioned has a scar, but it&#39;s not the same person,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face grew cold. &#34;Are you certain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded with assurance. &#34;Definitely. His body odor can&#39;t be hidden by any cologne. He&#39;s not the one who rescued me from the asylum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Caiden and asked, &#34;Who are you searching for? Why? What&#39;s the reason behind it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,assuming Cedric and Daniela remained an item,answered honestly, &#34;We&#39;re trying to find the mastermind behind the explosion. They targeted you and Daniela because you likely uncovered something that risked their interests.&#34; At that moment, Carol approached Daniela and whispered, &#34;Natalie and Winslow have escaped from prison!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze grew cold as she asked, &#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol replied, &#34;They reportedly tunneled out and escaped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was stunned. &#34;Aren&#39;t the male and female prisoners kept apart? They must have dug two separate tunnels. The person behind this is going all out. Daniela&#39;s just recovered, and they&#39;re already making their move. They&#39;re still determined to kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He counted on his fingers and added, &#34;Three years ago,when Daniela fell into a coma, they released me and Joyce,hoping we would take control of her assets.Now, they got Natalie and Winslow out of prison,intending to get rid of Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grew fearful. &#34;Daniela, what have you done to make them so desperate to remove you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained composed as she placed her glass down. &#34;Just concentrate on finding the person for me. I&#39;ll take care of the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she stood up. Cedric watched her worriedly, hesitated briefly, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>then decided to follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at himn. Cedric&#39;s limp seemed less severe than when she first returned, though it was still difficult for him to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me come with you. I can protect you,&#34; Cedric said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can protect myself,&#34; she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for her pregnancy three years ago, the explosion wouldn&#39;t have trapped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter what you say,&#34; Cedric said resolutely.He understood Daniela intended to investigate the past,but he hadn&#39;t grasped just how extensive the enemy&#39;s influence was. Now that Natalie and Winslow had escaped, they would certainly target Daniela. &#34;I&#39;m your husband. It&#39;s my duty to keep you safe! You may say harsh things,but this time,I won&#39;t leave your alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the deep night sky, Cedric&#39;s look was unwavering and resolute.</p>
