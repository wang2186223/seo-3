                <p>At this moment, the elevator doors slid open, and Cedric stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft glow from outside illuminated his sharp features, stirring an unexpected flutter in Natalie&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that no matter how much time had passed, her feelings for Cedric had never wavered. If anything,they had onlygrown stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,&#34;she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was discussing Elite Lux&#39;s security upgrades with Ryan when he heard her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he spotted Natalie, he stopped mid-conversation and asked, &#34;Ms. Dury, do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t help but feel a sting at how distant and formal Cedric addressed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, we used to go to the same school. There&#39;s no need to be so formal. Just call me Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse observed the exchange from a distance, anticipation gleaming in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Cedric was the ideal candidate for a son-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s patience was wearing thin. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to tellyou something.&#34; Natalie hesitated, glancing at Ryan beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan crossed his arms, making it clear he had no plans to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bit her bottom lip. &#34;I just wanted to clear up a misunderstanding. The things said in that group chat about Linden and I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What group chat?&#34; Cedric cut her off, turning to Ryan.′′|smy wife in it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face darkened, and she was on the verge of tears. Was Daniela the only person Cedric truly cared about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded. &#34;Yeah, she is. Do you want me to add you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Natalie blurted out, panic creeping into her voice. &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant. It&#39;s just a silly group chat.If you&#39;re not in it, don&#39;t worry about it..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in,&#34; Cedric interrupted. &#34;So, what&#39;s being discussed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately Cedric entered the chat, he could sense the hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan skimmed through the messages before reading one aloud. &#34;That slut, pretending to be aloof, still has the nerve to seduce Ms. Hárper&#39;s man. She should take a good look in the mirror. She&#39;s only fit for Linden. In my opinion, Ms. Harper shouldn&#39;t tolerate having her around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed by Natalie, Cedric asked Ryan indifferently, &#34;Who&#39;s supposed to be seducing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan quickly caught up to Cedric. &#34;They&#39;re saying Ms. Harper&#39;s man. So, are you her man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded without hesitation. &#34;Of course. I&#39;m her only man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded in agreement. &#34;That&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood there, watching as Cedric walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ryan confirmed Cedric&#39;s words, Cedric let out a chuckle. He was completely uninterested in anything that didn&#39;t involve Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her fists, her eyes reddening as a wave of frustration washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have let it go like she always did in the past. However, she bit her lip and rushed after him today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, just give me five minutes. Let me explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped and turned to Natalie, his gaze cold. &#34;Explain? To me? About what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His three questions showed his confusion, but his expression remained equally indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The chat... People are just making things up. I&#39;m not like that. Cedric finally comprehended. &#34;Oh, you are the person they&#39;re talking about in the group chat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded, her eyes teary. &#34;But it&#39;s all a misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say more, Ryan pulled up the photos Nina had posted earlier in the chat. &#34;How is this a misunderstanding? I heard you two held that pose for half an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes welled with tears as she stared at the photo, showing Linden&#39;s hand creeping up her shirt,settling on her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pushed the office door open and stepped inside, Ryan trailing after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood frozen, the humiliation settling deep in her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned on her heels and went straight to find Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp crack echoed as a hot slap landed across Nina&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina laughed loudly, her laughter so intense that it made her whole body tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression darkened, her voice shaking with fury. &#34;Nina! Do you even still call yourself part of the Dury family? Your own sister was humiliated, and you stood there snapping photos? Have you completely lost your humanity? You heartless fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice trembled with rage as she spoke, her anger unmistakably genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina looked at Natalie&#39;s tear-streaked face and Elyse&#39;s furious outburst, suddenly realizing a harsh truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless the pain was felt firsthand, it was nearly impossible to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, when you sent me to sleep with Linden on Natalie&#39;s behalf,did you ever show me any concern?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s slap obliterated Nina&#39;s final shred of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina tasted the blood on her lip and curled her lip into a sneer.&#34; &#34;Now Natalie can comprehend what the pain l&#39;ve endured feels like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Nina had completely lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She burst into Daniela&#39;s office, her voice sharp. &#34;Daniela, if you still consider me your aunt, you&#39;ll fire Nina from Elite Lux. If not, I&#39;ll take Natalie with me. You can only choose one.&#34;</p>
