                <p>As Cedric turned his head, Natalie couldn&#39;t miss the shadow of disappointment that flickered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he&#39;d been expecting Daniela to walk through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie decided to let it slide. She gave him a polite smile, handed him a cup of coffee,and said,&#34;Good morning, Mr. Phillips. I&#39;m Ms. Harper&#39;s new personal assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, Natalie gave Cedric a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a moment, she turned her attention to tidying up Daniela&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, she exited the office without uttering another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Elyse lingered by the doorway,her brows drawn together in quiet concern as she observed the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think Cedric will notice you if you keep hiding your true self?&#34; Elyse asked. Gazing through the office door at the man inside,Natalie replied, &#34;Mom, you just don&#39;t get it. Most men don&#39;t value what comes to them too easily. They take for granted anything that falls into their laps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded thoughtfully. &#34;It seems you&#39;re sure about your plan. I&#39;ll take Nina home later so I don&#39;t get in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Natalie replied with a calm air as she applied lipstick in front of the mirror. &#34;That fool being around only makes me shine brighter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Natalie gathered the files from the table and strode back into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained by the floor-to-ceiling window,prompting her to cast him a quick, indifferent glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Phillips, I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking, but are you a fan of the renowned painter Monica Miller?&#34;Natalie asked with a warm, easygoing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression shifted to one of surprise. &#34;How could you possibly know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monica was undeniably a celebrated artist, and Cedric hadnever shared his admiration for her with anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile as she gestured to the handkerchief in Cedric&#39;s breast pocket. &#34;The pattern and style are so reminiscent of  her work. I used to admire her, too, but I was quite disappointed when I heard she retired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was on the verge of replying when the office door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped into the doorway, fully aware Cedric had been waiting for her but surprised to see Natalie there as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trusting her instincts, Natalie quickly briefed Daniela on her work progress before stepping out and closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she epitomized the role of a capable and efficient secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Nina had caught sight of the brief exchange between Cedric and Natalie. Her face twisted with jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie noticed Nina&#39;s envious glare and responded with a faint, disdainful sneer. &#34;Idiot,&#34; she muttered under her breath before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina wasn&#39;t done. She hurried after Natalie.&#34;Would you dare show Cedric the real you? You&#39;re just hiding behind a mask!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t even bother to dignify her with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her gaze lowered, she slipped her hand into her  purse,retrieving a small wallet adorned with an oil-painting motif. A gentle smile graced her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the office, Cedric remained by the window,unmoving, as if rooted to the spot where he had stood all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lingered by the door,hesitant, uncertain about how to take the first step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were countless explanations she owed him,yet faced with Cedric&#39;s presence, the words seemed to evaporate from her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps, she thought, an apology could serve as a starting point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she knew Cedric would probably say, &#34;It&#39;s all right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she would have to admit, &#34;I still can&#39;t make our relationship public. Can you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what could Cedric say in response to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it in her gut-no matter what she said,Cedric&#39;s spirit would remain bruised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had done everything to shield him from the burdens that were hers to bear, yet in the end,he had carried them for her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear to see the once-proud man seem diminished in her presence. Daniela&#39;s hands curled into tight fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she declare their relationship over? The words refused to form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood in silence for what felt like forever before finally speaking. &#34;I&#39;m giving you the right to choose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze turned stormy in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He attempted a nod and a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it came off more like he was on the verge of breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Cedric asked sharply, his eyes locked on Daniela. Despite the calm he had tried to cultivate in recent days, his voice betrayed his tension.&#34;What are you talking about? A breakup? Or a divorce?Make it clear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a cold ache spread through Daniela&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists tightened until her nails pressed painfully into her palms, forcing her to cling to rationality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either one. The choice is yours,&#34; she said, her voice void of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed weighed heavy in the air, pressing down on them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a slow nod, though a bitter smile ghosted across his lips. &#34;Should I be grateful you&#39;ve allowed me this final shred of dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had returned, weary and worn, only to be greeted by these icy words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d have preferred your lies. At least then I could believe you felt something for me instead of forcing me to choose between two cruel options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice faded into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said nothing more. He swung the door open and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood frozen by the door, stunned. &#34;What happened?&#34; she asked Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped further into the office, with Lillian following close behind. &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s no need for this standoff. Even if Elyse has support, you can manage it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply. Instead, she handed Lillian a folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced down at the folder. &#34;Where did this come from? Cedric&#39;s background? Wasn&#39;t he raised in an orphanage? How...&#34; As her eyes skimmed over the words, Lillian froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she burst out, &#34;What on earth is this?It&#39;s unbelievable!&#34;</p>
