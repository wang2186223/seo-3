                <p>Daniela&#39;s face hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph noticed but didn&#39;t let it bother him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, no matter how sharp Daniela appeared, she was still a young woman-clever, yes,but far from being a real threat to Hamilton&#39;s mastery of business and strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, a man of immense power, was the one Daniela and Cedric should be trying to impress. They should be respectful toward his secretary too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why was she looking at him with such disdain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s annoyance simmered, but he kept his smile intact. &#34;Ms. Harper, this way, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast him a scornful glance, a mocking smile playing at her lips. &#34;Cedric and l&#39;are a couple. If Mr.McCoy won&#39;t meet us together, then he won&#39;t meet either of us at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, countless people had pleaded for a chance to meet Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Daniela had the audacity to make demands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you won&#39;t meet him?&#34; Joseph&#39;s voice took on a sharper edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even bother to answer. She simply turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stood frozen, too stunned to call out after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph finally returned to Hamilton&#39;s side and said, &#34;Mr. McCoy, Daniela has left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, seated at the head of the table, slowly opened his eyes. &#34;I heard every word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face flushed with anger. &#34;She&#39;s unbearably arrogant! She doesn&#39;t respect you at all.&#34; Hamilton smiled coldly. &#34;She has no regard for anyone here. There&#39;s only one person she cares about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph asked,&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a chilling laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who else could it possibly be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, it was Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it that Daniela had lost her memories, yet after testing her over the past two days, Hamilton realized she guarded Cedric fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood firm in shielding Cedric from the McCoy family&#39;s ruthless power battles and refused to let him step into McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had decided to protect Cedric firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By bringing Cedric to tonight&#39;s banquet, she aimed to make it crystal clear to Hamilton that Cedric was under her protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was free to choose whether or not he wanted to join McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sending a strong message to Hamilton, signaling that the years of neglect and harm he had caused Cedric couldn&#39;t simply be overlooked with a casual apology or the McCoy family&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By presenting Cedric before everyone tonight, Daniela firmly declared his innocence, shifting all the blame onto Hamilton-the very man who had heartlessly cast his son aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had accomplished everything she set out to do and said all that needed to be said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no longer any need for her to meet with Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,it was Hamilton who found himself in a dilemma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Nikolas&#39; performance tonight still secure his position as the McCoy family&#39;s heir? Did he even have the ability to lead? At the same time, Damon and Duran had humiliated themselves during the gambling, tarnishing the McCoy family&#39;s reputation and effectively removing themselves from the race for the inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This left only Kohen and Charles as the remaining contenders for the inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression grew grim as he gazed out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was impressive. In just two hours, she had thrown his meticulous plans into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If none of his five sons could be counted on, then Cedric would be his only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was completely loyal to Daniela, which meant she would take the reins of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left Hamilton both shocked and anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela guided Cedric out, Duran crouched on the floor, reduced to a humiliating display of barking like a dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon remained seated, lost in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Damon saw Daniela, he slowly rose to his feet. Cedric furrowed his brow and positioned himself protectively in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face turned pale. He ignored Cedric and looked at Daniela.′′Are you truly the legendary Shim?&#34;Nikolas shut his eyes in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed Damon couldn&#39;t accept defeat and had come to confront Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Damon expressed admiration for Daniela and spoke to her with respect.</p>
