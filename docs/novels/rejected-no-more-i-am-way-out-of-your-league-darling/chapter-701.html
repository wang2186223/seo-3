                <p>Nikolas and Kohen had spent a long time searching,but the handwriting&#39;s source still escaped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stepped inside, they spotted Cedric sitting in the pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen turned to Nikolas. &#34;Why don&#39;t we go talk to him? He&#39;s an adult. He shouldn&#39;t just follow everything Daniela says. If we give him the right offer,he might reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas responded, &#34;But if we try anything and Dad finds out, it&#39;ll backfire. How much we get later depends on his mood. If he&#39;s upset, even getting rid of Cedric won&#39;t help us. We might end up empty-handed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen retorted, &#34;Unlike you, l&#39;vegot three kids to raise, Nikolas. If I don&#39;t fight for a bigger share, they&#39;ll suffer for it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pulled out a cigarette. &#34;Cedric&#39;s not as mild as he looks. He&#39;s got a short fuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen shook his head. &#34;He seems kind enough around Daniela. We&#39;re offering money and a friendly conversation. What reason does he have to refuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas took a slow drag. &#34;Put yourself in his shoes.Would you take the deal? Our father is the richest man in the world. What could we offer that compares? A million? Ten? It&#39;s still nothing compared to what he stands to gain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most outsiders thought the McCoy family lived lavish lives. But the truth was, every major expense needed Hamilton&#39;s signature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a real chance Cedric had more access to money than they did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hamilton wasn&#39;t on board, giving Cedric a large payout would be next to impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, Cedric&#39;s wife was Daniela, the former</p>
                
                
                
                <p>richest person in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you it&#39;s okay to smoke here?&#34; Cedric said,his tone clipped. &#34;Put it out. Smoking isn&#39;t allowed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas grumbled. &#34;Daniela didn&#39;t say anything.You&#39;re being too rigid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood across from them, his face firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he looked just like Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen recalled what Nikolas had said before-Cedric wasn&#39;t as simple as he seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stubbed out the cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do it again,&#34; said Cedric. His voice held no warmth. &#34;Daniela can&#39;t stand the smell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt a sting. As the eldest son of the world&#39;s richest man, he expected at least a little respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; With Cedric staring him down, Nikolas had no choice but to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t even glance back at them. He turned away,ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hurried over and blocked his path. &#34;Cedric,why are you rushing off? It&#39;s rare that the three of us are here together. Let&#39;s sit and talk for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together. He dropped his gaze and looked down at Kohen&#39;s hand gripping his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen let go without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got nothing to say to you,&#34; Cedric muttered.Then he turned to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen quickly followed, not ready to give up.&#34;Sooner or later, we&#39;ll need to talk this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went to the pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s it? You&#39;re really going to ignore everything between us and fight for the family inheritance?&#34;Nikolas asked Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat back in the shadows, his expression unreadable. &#34;I&#39;ve never accepted the idea that we&#39;re  a&#39;brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at him, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen perked up. &#34;So you&#39;re not trying to compete with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed to add more. &#34;If you&#39;re willing to cooperate, we won&#39;t treat you unfairly. Just tell us what you need. We&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re compensated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s tone didn&#39;t change. &#34;I don&#39;t want anything. If you&#39;re serious about helping, then assist my wife in finding out who wrote that note.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, who had been in the villa a few days longer,could already tell Cedric was in a foul mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen slapped his leg. &#34;No problem! As long as you&#39;re not going after the inheritance, I&#39;l leave right now. Doesn&#39;t matter how long it takes. I&#39;ll figure out who did it-even if it takes a decade!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had no interest in dragging the conversation out. He stood and gave a small nod. Once he was gone, Kohen turned to Nikolas, looking pleased.&#34;That went better than I expected. I thougnt we&#39;d have a much harder time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stayed cautious. &#34;Don&#39;t celebrate too early.What happens next depends on what Daniela decides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who holds the power makes the final call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela were anyone else, Cedric wouldn&#39;t even matter.But she wasn&#39;t ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made her name in the mercenary world.She could face down hundreds without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also led the global intelligence network at the highest rank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after lying in a coma for three years, she could still shift the tide of a situation in a matter of hours.Even Hamilton, who rarely praised anyone, spoke highly of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the richest woman on record was barely worth mentioning compared to her real influence Some things didn&#39;t hinge on what Cedric wanted.Even if he refused, others would force him to play his part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas believed Hamilton wouldn&#39;t pass up a chance to make the McCoy family even stronger.</p>
