        <div class="container">

            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexander held the bag, his tone calm and friendly as he said, &#34;I&#39;m just going to Daniela&#39;s office to drop something off, and then I&#39;ll be right back. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t cause you any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard shot him a hard look. &#34;No appointment, no entry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s polite tone now didn&#39;t mean he&#39;d take responsibility if things went south.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned in and lowered his voice. &#34;I can personally vouch for a position at Bennett Groupo for you if anything goes wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, the guard burst into laughter.&#34;Are you serious? Can Bennett Group even compare to Elite Lux? Do you have any idea what I make here every month?&#34; The guard flashed his fingers. &#34;This much. Can Bennett Group top that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s jobs were highly coveted. The guard had used his connections to get in and planned to stick around until retirement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would he throw away his lucky break for the so-called Bennett Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard dismissed Alexander with a wave. &#34;Get going! No more of this nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hadn&#39;t anticipated Elite Lux&#39;s security pay to be so high, nearly on par with a project manager&#39;s salary at Bennett Group. He composed himself and pulled a check from his pocket. &#34;Just a little something to show my gratitude, and I&#39;ll take full responsibility if anything goes wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outfit he had bought yesterday still lay in the bag, and Alexander was determined to make today a success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard looked at the amount on the check before saying, &#34;Add another zero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander made his way upstairs with the bag,a sharp, cold pain tightening in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His visit to Elite Lux had already set him back by 100thousand dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth, his resolve strengthening. Today,he was going to win Daniela over, no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric was behind the wheel, driving Daniela to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they pulled away from the villa, his phone vibrated in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he didn&#39;t pay it any mind initially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention was on Daniela as they laughed and chatted happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, the phone rang, cutting through the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly glanced at the caller ID-it was Ryan. A faint frown appeared on Cedric&#39;s face as he answered the call. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you on your way tothe office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Daniela with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated for a moment, maintaining his calm.&#34;Why do you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Ryan understood Daniela was right beside him.He whispered,&#34;Alexander&#39;s at Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he doing there?&#34; Cedric responded indifferently, shifting the phone to his other ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No clue. He&#39;s carrying a bag. I zoomed in to see what&#39;s inside and sent it to your phone. Check it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ended the call and quickly glanced at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately understood the reason for Ryan&#39;s call. Alexander stepped into the Elite Lux building, his grip tight on a very plain-looking bag. The surveillance footage revealed a faint glimpse of a smaller bag inside the larger one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The writing on the smaller bag was sleek, black, and subtly provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just two words, but Cedric could make them out clearly: &#34;Midnight Secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly searched on his phone and found it was the name of an adult store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, sitting next to him, noticed Cedric&#39;s gaze slowly hardening. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked,concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled. &#34;Nothing, just a spooky story I heard.I thought it was kind of funny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he finished speaking, his phone vibrated once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Ryan had sent a text. &#34;He&#39;s upstairs.Should we stop him?&#34; Cedric didn&#39;t respond right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes scanned the latest market share reports of Bennett Group&#39;s subsidiaries, and in an instant, he made up his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squinted and replied to Ryan, &#34;No need. Let him do whatever he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message from Ryan popped up. &#34;He just told the secretary he&#39;s heading to Daniela&#39;s office.The lounge door&#39;s never been locked. Is Alexander really that desperate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric commanded, &#34;Let him be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan responded, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ran his tongue over his teeth, a flicker of cold,dangerous intent flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed in fair play, but resorting to underhanded tactics to win Daniela&#39;s favor was a step too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was downright despicable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as those thoughts churned in his mind, Cedric hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t fear of Alexander that held him back, but concern for Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit his bottom lip, then turned to meet her gaze.&#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever really talked about your past with Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow in surprise. &#34;You want to talk about it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pursed his lips. &#34;It&#39;s a long drive. Can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t mind. She hadn&#39;t brought it up before because it didn&#39;t seem necessary. But if Cedric wanted to talk about it, she was okay with that.&#34;What do you want to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her question, Cedric fell quiet again. The past didn&#39;t concern him. He only cared about whether Daniela would be in his future. &#34;So what do you think of Alexander now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked what truly mattered to him, his voice careful, as if their relationship wasn&#39;t fully settled yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was direct and firm. &#34;He&#39;s in the past. I don&#39;t think about him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she continued, &#34;I don&#39;t waste time thinking about someone who&#39;s just a stranger now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, his eyes narrowing slightly. &#34;And what if he regrets it? I can see he&#39;s always regretted divorcing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;True, but that&#39;s not what matters to me. What&#39;s important is the person I love and the one who holds a special place in my heart. In a situation like this, I don&#39;t consider anyone else.I simply follow what feels right for me.&#34;</p>
