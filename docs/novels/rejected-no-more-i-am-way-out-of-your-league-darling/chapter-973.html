                <p>The following day, Daniela&#39;s lawyer delivered the divorce agreement straight to Josh&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the agreement,Josh stormed into her office without knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three McCoy brothers were already there. None of them said a word. They hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to go this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton tried to get up, worried that Josh, in his rage,might lash out-especially with Daniela carrying twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan blocked him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Hamilton snapped, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad shot back, &#34;What&#39;s your deal?&#34;。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton retorted, &#34;Can&#39;t you tell he&#39;s about to explode? What if he hurts Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the couch, Brad peeled an orange slice and tossed it into his mouth. &#34;Relax. Getting in the way won&#39;t,help. She&#39;s got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.Ethan reached for a blueberry, gave a short nod, and added, &#34;He&#39;s right. I&#39;ve only now realized how little use we are to her. Honestly, you&#39;re not going to make a difference. Let Daniela handle her own business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw clenched. He hated how truethat sounded.Still, after thinking about it, he couldn&#39;t deny it-he hadn&#39;t done much for her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grunt, he sank back into his seat and yanked an apple from the platter. He bit down hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh looked completely unhinged. He slammed the agreement down in front of Daniela. &#34;What the hell is this supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned into the sofa, a habit she&#39;d picked up since the pregnancy, and looked at him without moving. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t read anymore? Do you need a lawyer to read it out loud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face darkened. &#34;Have you no shame? I already paid Ethan back, and now you&#39;re trying to ruin my marriage. What kind of person are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet laugh.&#34;Oh, so this is my fault now? If you didn&#39;t have six kids outside your marriage,would Victoria be leaving you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh clenched his fists. &#34;I know I messed up, but I&#39;ve been trying to fix it. So what if I have six kids with another woman? I married Victoria, didn&#39;t I? What .more could she possibly want? I&#39;ve given her everything. A comfortable life, more than most women could even dream of. So what did I do wrong?How have I ever treated her badly? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve hidden her. Bring her here. Ask her yourself.What could she be so unhappy about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now,he clung to his image of control, acting like nothing was unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela saw straight through the performance.&#34;Now isn&#39;t the right time to see her. Once this is over,you&#39;ll have your chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s temper flared. &#34;So that woman&#39;s really going through with it? She&#39;s divorcing me and taking everything? Fine. Then nobody gets to be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned. &#34;If I find her, she&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot Daniela one last furious glare and stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove straight to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still seething,he tried calling Victoria-only to realize she&#39;d blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze snapped toward Mason, who was lounging in bed,laughing into a video call with a girl on his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh walked over and said coldly, &#34;Call your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason blinked in confusion. Josh slammed his fist against the side table. &#34;Call her. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Mason ended the chat and tapped on Victoria&#39;s contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s off,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh yanked the phone from his hands, jaw tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had expected Victoria to break eventually-but not this fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the door swung open. Victoria stood there,trembling, phone in hand. &#34;Josh just texted me from Mason&#39;s phone. He said if I don&#39;t show up soon, he&#39;s going to hurt Mason.&#34;</p>
