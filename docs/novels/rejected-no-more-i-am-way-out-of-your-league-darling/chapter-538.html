                <p>Bruno&#39;s smirk stiffened instantly, his expression hardening. &#34;What the hell is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary trailed closely behind as they stepped into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance director anxiously extended the latest financial report, hands slightly trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s composed demeanor shattered in an instant,morphing from detached disinterest to sheer disbelief,before twisting into unchecked rage. &#34;What the hell did you just say? Repeat that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing director hesitated before stepping forward, his gaze averted. &#34;Elite Lux&#39;s gaming division has just launched a direct competitor to our title.Their visuals are crisper, their characters more dynamic, and the gameplay offers a level of depth that players find irresistible. And...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his voice even further, he added, &#34;It&#39;s absolutely free. Players can unlockevery weapon and skin simply by progressing in the game. To make matters worse, every celebrity affiliated with Elite Lux is actively promoting it. In short, there&#39;s no room left  for us in the market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s temple throbbed, veins pulsing with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing director took a cautious step back, his expression grim. The sales director quickly took his place. &#34;Mr. Deleon, this launch has set off a domino effect. Our entire game portfolio is suffering-every single title is seeing a decline in sales!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technology director added, &#34;Mr. Deleon,I reached out to a friend working in Elite Lux&#39;s gaming sector. He confirmed that they have over a hundred more titles lined up-and every single one of them will be free!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously. &#34;All free? What is this, a damn charity? How the hell is Daniela funding this madness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance director said, &#34;Elite Lux&#39;s gaming division is merely a fraction of their empire. They&#39;ve seamlessly incorporated subtle advertisements within their games. While the games themselves aren&#39;t profitable, their in-game ads and strategic product placements generate significant revenue. According to highly credible sources, the income from advertisements and merchandise sales has not only offset their development costs but has already pushed them into profitability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s fury burned so intensely, he felt like his entire being might combust. Cedric was absolutely ruthless! &#34;Cut the damn explanations! Give me the numbers.How much have we lost?&#34; Bruno clutched his chest,his breath coming in ragged gasps under the crushing weight of the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance director looked ready to sink into the floor. &#34;Our stock prices have been in freefall, and as of tonight, they&#39;ve bottomed out. We&#39;ve already hemorrhaged over 30 billion dollars. If this decline doesn&#39;t stop, by the time tonight is over, our losses will surpass 80 billion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep, steadying breath, he delivered the final blow. &#34;We&#39;ve lost what would have been five years&#39; worth of profits gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his report concluded, the director lowered his head,unwilling to meet Bruno&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room remained silent, heads bowed in a shared sense of dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A suffocating silence filled the office,thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease was etched across their expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another five dragged by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees exchanged uneasy glances. The secretary hesitated,then cautiously lifted his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Deleon!&#34; he shouted in panic. Bruno had slumped over his desk, completely unresponsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick! Call an ambulance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted within the company, spreading like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News outlets pounced on the story, and by the time Bruno stirred awake, Deleon Group had hemorrhaged over 100 billion dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single day had undone everything Bruno had spent years building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second his eyes fluttered open, he blacked out once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining members of the commerce association were just as dumbfounded, shaken by Cedric&#39;s growing ruthlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They convened once more, though none of them had anticipated their next meeting would be in a hospital room the very next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is absurd! Completely insane!&#34; Bruno bellowed from his hospital bed. &#34;Cedric is out to destroy me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow, standing off to the side, idly clipped his nails. &#34;I told you-we should&#39;ve just paid up.If you had,you wouldn&#39;t be down 80 billion now, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at Bruno. &#34;How was I supposed to know they&#39;d be this ruthless? What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he caved now, that 80 billion loss would be for nothing! The very idea made his blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett narrowed his eyes, just as shaken by Cedric&#39;s cold-blooded efficiency. It was clear-Cedric wasn&#39;t holding back in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why start with Bruno?&#34; Marcus, who had been quiet until now, finally spoke up. &#34;Cedric could&#39;ve gone after Hackett or even Winslow, the youngest. So why go after Bruno first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had questioned it until now, but once the thought surfaced,it lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno felt wronged. &#34;Exactly! Why me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett leaned in. &#34;Bruno, did you cross Cedric in any way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno shook his head furiously. &#34;How could I? I&#39;ve always treated Cedric with respect. I have no idea why he&#39;d single me out first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighty billion-gone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of money would take years, maybe decades,  to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just financial ruin-it was an execution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you never stepped on Cedric&#39;s toes before,then ...&#34; Hackett&#39;s words faded into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the group exchanged wary glances, a silent revelation dawning upon them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno noticed their expressions and grew agitated.&#34;What&#39;s with those looks? I swear, I never crossed Cedric! The only thing I did was curse at Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno stopped cold. Then, smacking his thigh, he gasped, &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have insulted her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same night, Bruno discharged himself from the hospital, clutching expensive gifts and a hefty check,sprinting towards Elite Lux.</p>
