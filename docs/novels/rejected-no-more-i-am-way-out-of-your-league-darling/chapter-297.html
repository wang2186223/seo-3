                <p>Katrina knew how ruthless Brylee was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At an elaborate dinner, a group of men had compelled Brylee to consume an excessive amount of alcohol. She had drunk each glass, not once faltering in her demeanor. However, when their tactics had taken a deceptive turn, Brylee had shattered a bottle over one man&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The violence had escalated when a knife had plunged cleanly through the man&#39;s palm, filling the room with his pained screams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the chaos, someone had thought to film Brylee,intending to depict her as a violent instigator. Yet,Brylee had been unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night&#39;s events had made Brylee a well-known figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, no one had dared to challenge her again. Even years later, Katrina could still recall the image of Brylee&#39;s blood-streaked face on the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, in many ways, was both similar to and distinct from Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shared Brylee indomitable strength and authoritative air. Yet, she possessed a serenity that Brylee never had, her emotions masked behind a veneer of perfect calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This aspect of Daniela was indeed intimidating to Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, you are my daughter. I would never hurt you. Opportunities like this are rare. If you don&#39;t grasp it now, it may never come again. I&#39;ll leave the choice to you, though. Take your time to think it through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina responded with a soft, barely audible agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they were about to end the call, Katrina paused,then spoke up hesitantly. &#34;Mom? I&#39;ve always tried to support you, but now I&#39;m the one in need. Could you possibly lend me some money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice quivered as she went on, &#34;This isn&#39;t for me;it&#39;s for Joyce. I need to settle her debts to bring her home.I wouldn&#39;t be asking if I weren&#39;t desperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, Katrina&#39;s mother responded,&#34;Alright. I don&#39;t have much to spare either. I&#39;m old,Katrina. I can&#39;t risk leaving myself destitute. But I&#39;ll send you most of what l&#39;ve saved, keeping just enough to get by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately,Katrina had faced nothing but rejections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected support from her mother brought tears to her eyes instantly. &#34;Mom, I swear I&#39;ll repay you,&#34; she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say things like that, Katrina. We&#39;re family.During tough times, you realize who truly values you.Remember who&#39;s there for you now and who just stood by, watching you struggle. Forget about those who didn&#39;t care. Think about that wealthy man l mentioned. I&#39;ll wire the money later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sudden click, the call was disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman bearing two jagged scars across her face returned to her seat at the poker table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clattering of cards and chips resumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erika, didn&#39;t I told you that the rich guy has some weird quirks? Why didn&#39;t you pick someone else for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika Schmidt, with a wry smirk and a cigarette dangling from her lips, replied evenly, &#34;Why pass up such a chance on outsiders when I can keep it within the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough. That guy is loaded, but I&#39;ve heard his last few wives... Well, let&#39;s just say their ends were anything but peaceful. Are you going to warn Katrina about that? It&#39;s not something just anyone can handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika laughed. &#34;Warn her about what? It&#39;s tough to earn a buck, and life&#39;s no walk in the park. She&#39;ll catch on soon enough. Nothing&#39;s handed to you on a silver platter. Once she&#39;s free of Caiden, she&#39;ll adapt just fine.AlII need to do is grab the cash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five hours later, Katrina&#39;s phone chimed, signaling a wire transfer of five hundred thousand dollars had landed in her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was less than she&#39;d expected, yet it was still a decent sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of relief washed over her, and just as she was about to redistribute the funds, her phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was a photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in the photo was unmistakably wealthy but looked entirely ordinary with his stout frame,round face, and shifty, narrow eyes that sparkled with a disconcerting greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him was enough to make Katrina&#39;s stomach twist uncomfortably. Without hesitation, she deleted the image, secured her funds, and completed a transfer of three million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick handoff of two hundred dollars to the intermediary, she sealed an agreement to gradually return a staggering hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everything in motion, Katrina was left to anxiously await further developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Caiden was waiting for money as well.His phone never left his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime, he managed to squeeze in attendance at a social event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, he felt suffocated, confined by his own circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The debacle with Joyce had severely dented his image, casting a shadow over his reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the public declaration to sever all ties with Joyce now circulating, Caiden felt liberated enough to step out into the world again. As he neared the restaurant&#39;s entrance and reached for the door handle, a flurry of voices spilled out from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really have to give Caiden credit. Everyone&#39;s buzzing about Joyce being nothing but trouble, yet here he is, not hiding away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. I burst out laughing the moment I saw Caiden&#39;s post. That guy? He cuts people off if they embarrass him, but grovels back when he needs something from them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. I caught him the other day, practically on his knees to Daniela, who wouldn&#39;t even glance his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s got such a cool temperament. Were it me,Caiden would&#39;ve earned a good few slaps by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! And here&#39;s the kicker-imagine if Daniela hit a rough patch and Joyce ended up with some wealthy guy. Do you seriously believe Caiden would stoop so low as to crawl back to Joyce?&#34; The thought alone is hysterical!&#34; &#34;Caiden is so pathetic!&#34;</p>
