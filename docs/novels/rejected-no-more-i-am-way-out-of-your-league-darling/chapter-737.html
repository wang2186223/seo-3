                <p>Honestly, if Carol hadn&#39;t pointed it out, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have even realized she was smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, peeking through the sliding kitchen door,quietly observing the scene unfolding inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood there in laid-back attire,a simple black apron tied around him, grinning as he moved through the kitchen like it was his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol said, &#34;Cedric&#39;s secretary told me that after you left, Cedric looked like a wreck at first. Then he snapped-turned cold and cutthroat, so sharp that people were scared to even breathe around him. Now that he&#39;s in Oiscoll, the business folks back in Olisvine are practically popping champagne in relief.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, clearly startled. &#34;Seriously? It was that dramatic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a firm nod. &#34;It&#39;s exactly that dramatic.He turned into a storm in the boardroom. He&#39;s now the wealthiest man in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over at Cedric, her eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol chuckled. &#34;Cedric&#39;s sharp as a tack. He just never cared much about chasing the top until now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Carol were casually chatting when an unexpected guest showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stormed in, looking rattled. The moment his eyes landed on Cedric in the kitchen, he stiffened.&#34;What&#39;s he doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela always maintained Cedric&#39;s dignity in front of others. She shot back coolly, &#34;Why ask that? He doesn&#39;t have the right to be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles dragged a tense hand through his hair. &#34;If he&#39;s here, then where does that ,leave me? Daniela you promised you&#39;d help me. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re pulling back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles wasn&#39;t blind-he knew Cedric and Daniela were still husband and wife. If Cedric stayed out of it, CCharles still had a chance at inheriting the Hamilton empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Cedric stepped in, Daniela would stand behind him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that case, what would he be left with?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few days, Charles had been floating in a dream he didn&#39;t want to leave-until Cedric showed up and shattered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Charles was mid-rant, the security phone by the door began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid picked up the call and turned to Daniela. &#34;Ms.Harper, there&#39;s a Mr. McCoy at the gate asking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles automatically figured it was one of his brothers dropping by unannounced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, he flung the door open. &#34;Mr. McCoy? Let&#39;s see who...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words died in his throat the moment his father&#39;s long, sleek Lincoln glided up to the front likea shark cutting through still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a heartbeat, the color drained from Charles&#39; face like water down a sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gut reaction? Run. Far and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught the sheer panic in Charles&#39; eyes and furrowed her brow in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most sons carry a cocktail of respect, pride, and maybe a touch of fear for their dads. But why did Charles look like he&#39;d just seen a ghost?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, should I just hide?&#34; Charles muttered,nerves creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too late,&#34; Daniela said calmly. The car was already in the driveway, and with those wide glass windows, there was no hiding. &#34;He&#39;s seen you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s instincts were sharp as&#39;a blade-she knew when someone had been spotted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had gone ghost-pale, his body starting to quiver like a leaf in a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to shout, but fear strangled his voice into a whisper. &#34;Daniela, did you invite my father here today? Why? Did you bring my father here to meet Cedric? What are you trying to do? Why didn&#39;t you tell me if you invited him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze remained steady, her voice frosty.&#34;didn&#39;t reach out to your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left her lips, Charles&#39; whole body jolted like he&#39;d been electrocuted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how the hell did he know Cedric was here?Has he been spying on you? Cedric just got here-and suddenly my father appears?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s likely the case,&#34; Daniela answered, cool as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hadn&#39;t even been here ten hours, and Hamilton had already shown up. There was no way that was just coincidence.</p>
