                <p>Hamilton had just shown a rare concession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary was taken aback. Given Hamilton&#39;s typical control over all decisions, his willingness to compromise with Daniela was indeed a surprising shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This adaptability emphasized Daniela&#39;s influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary found himself observing Daniela more intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze was fixed on Daniela, anticipating her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a nonchalant tone, Daniela said, &#34;I respect Cedric&#39;s decision. If he decides to calI you his father,I won&#39;t object.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was about to smile when Daniela continued,&#34;Just ensure no threats come his way, and don&#39;t drag me into your schemes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, the smile on Hamilton&#39;s face quickly disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, noticing Hamilton&#39;s rigid demeanor, added casually, &#34;I&#39;ve given you fair warning before. Here itis again-if Cedric gets upset because of you, I&#39;m more than ready to engage in a corporate battle. In fact,taking on the world&#39;s richest man could be quite the thrill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Is this a test or a challenge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s potential was a mystery, and the world&#39;s billionaire list hadn&#39;t been refreshed for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally,bystanders were thrilled at the prospect of witnessing a corporate clash between Daniela and Hamilton, curious to see who would emerge as the superior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, such confrontations were only a spectacle for those uninvolved. Hamilton had no interest in witnessing such a conflict unfold. Hamilton regarded Daniela with a cool expression.&#34;The McCoy family is Cedric&#39;s family too. Every action you take influJences the family&#39;s standing and directly affects Cedric&#39;s potential inheritance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted her gaze to Hamilton, taking in the self-assured expression on his face. &#34;You really believe Cedric&#39;s going to accept you just like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hamilton replied, &#34;Everyone has a price. And if money doesn&#39;t work, then it&#39;s because they&#39;re chasing love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There should have been some kind of bond, some natural affection between father and son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could see clearly now-Hamilton had changed tactics, opting for a softer, more indirect approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Proving her right, he made his way toward the kitchen the next moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t step inside. Instead, he remained by the doorway, accepted a small pastry box from his secretary, and set it on the nearby table. &#34;I get that you&#39;re not ready to accept me yet. Still, blood doesn&#39;t lie. These were your mother&#39;s favorite pastries. I made them myself this morning. Try them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t rush off after that. For a moment, he lingered at the threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cedric continued cleaning in silence, not even glancing in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an awkward stretch of silence, Hamilton finally muttered, &#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll stop by another day. The food was excellent, by the way.&#34; There was an effort in his voice, clumsy and unpolished, like someone trying to speak a language they&#39;d forgotten. &#34;Come home for a meal sometime,&#34; he added, almost as an afterthought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression as he exited was anything but cheerful-and Charles noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of serving at Hamilton&#39;s side had taught Charles how to read the man. He understood that Hamilton was prideful to a fault, and rarely allowed anyone, not even his own sons, to challenge his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet this time, he had taken a step back. He was extending the olive branch, not just because Cedric was capable-but because he respected Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notion of a woman poised to lead Cealmaur suggested she was far from ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her support, the McCoy dynasty could become an unbeatable force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, it wasn&#39;t just about Hamilton courting Cedric&#39;s favor; more crucially, it was about securing Daniela&#39;s allegiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; thoughts were heavy as he remembered the secretary&#39;s words. &#34;Whoever has Daniela on their side, wins the McCoy fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a newfound resolve, Charles approached Daniela, his earlier apprehension replaced by a practiced smile. &#34;What did my father discuss with you earlier?&#34;Daniela&#39;s voice was clear and direct. &#34;He wants Cedric to call him Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her candid response surprised Charles. He had expected her to be more guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s perceptiveness didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;You&#39;re not in a position to threaten Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stopped short, stung by the realization that he had just been dismissed outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father&#39;s intent on bringing Cedric back into our family.How do you feel about that?&#34; For Charles, this was the only issue that mattered. He had orchestrated things so Cedric would be gone for good. Yet, unexpectedly, Cedric had come to Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implications were daunting-a mix of pressure and evident threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone remained clear. &#34;It&#39;s his decision,ultimately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles responded in surprise, &#34;You promised you would back me up!&#34;  Daniela gave him a skeptical look. &#34;You think you&#39;re fit to run the McCoy empire with such little patience?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visibly upset, Charles bit his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reassured him, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Cedric isn&#39;t here for McCoy Group. His reason for being in Oiscoll is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was skeptical. &#34;Really? We&#39;re discussing the McCoy empire here. It&#39;s hard to think Cedric would overlook the immense fortune involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Believe it or not, your family&#39;s wealth doesn&#39;t surpass mine. Please, don&#39;t delude yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bewildered, Charles questioned her, &#34;What are you suggesting? How is your wealth relevant to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained calmly, &#34;It seems everyone forgets Cedric and I are united in marriage. His entitlement is to wvhatever I possess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting for a moment, Daniela continued, &#34;You know, despite the popularity of prenuptial agreements among the affluent, I chose not to sign one. So everything I own belongs to Cedric too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revelation left Charles completely dumbfounded.</p>
