            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved in a faint, almost dismissive smile. &#34;Honestly, the money doesn&#39;t matter to me. But.don&#39;t like being threatened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Daniela finished speaking, her smile vanished, replaced by an unmistakable air of menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept down Jules&#39; spine. &#34;You mean you&#39;re giving up on tracking down whoever was behind the explosion? Daniela, don&#39;t forget that&#39;s the reason you came to Oiscoll. If you don&#39;t agree to my terms, you&#39;ll never discover who orchestrated it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a sharp, humorless laugh. &#34;Why should I care? I already know the culprit is tied to your family.Maybe it&#39;s time you all paid for what happened to my unborn child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild, dangerous glint flashed in her eyes, leaving Jules visibly rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re finished here. You can leave,&#34; Daniela said coldly, her tone brooking no argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules stood frozen, completely thrown by the coldness beneath Daniela&#39;s calm surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really not going to negotiate?&#34; The lure of those investment funds tugged at Jules, and he didn&#39;t want to walk away empty-handed. &#34;I don&#39;t need the full amount-just half. Even a third would be enough.Daniela, that&#39;s my bottom line. Think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made a smal gesture, and Cedric moved to escort Jules out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration washed over Jules-he&#39;d never met anyone quite as unyielding as Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, Daniela. I&#39;m willing to settle for even less. Just give me something, anything! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m begging here and still getting nothing. Do you really want to embarrass me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same indifference Daniela showed when she first offered Jules money was now replaced with a frigid detachment. &#34;Daniela, just hand over that small company on the south side. It&#39;s nothing but a shell anyway, completely worthless!&#34; Jules demanded, his voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Cedric a quick look,and he immediately paused mid-motion, holding off from tossing Jules o the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules let out a shaky breath, straightened his jacket, and glanced at Daniela&#39;s way, suddenly at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had it come to this? Why was he begging Daniela now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules cursed silently, feeling as if he&#39;d been played all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and began to tell Daniela the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the study, the McCoy brothers strained to catch Jules&#39; words, but after his last outburst,everything went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad frowned. &#34;What are they even talking about in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shrugged. &#34;What else? Jules&#39; probably trying to strike some kind of deal with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;I doubt it&#39;s that simple. Daniela isn&#39;t the type for light conversations, and if she invited Jules into the study, it must be something serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew why Daniela had come to Oiscoll in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s heart tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules came down the stairs with a spring in his step, wearing a look of smug satisfaction as he glanced at his brothers waiting below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad called out, &#34;What did you and Daniela talk about up there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules didn&#39;t bother answering. Instead, he strode toward the door with purpose. At the threshold, Hamilton hurried after him. &#34;Did you tell Daniela who was behind the explosion? Jules, do you have any idea what you&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules shot Hamilton a cold, dismissive look. &#34;You&#39;ve given everything for the McCoy family, but look what it&#39;s cost you. Your own grandchild paid the price. You still want to protect the family? You&#39;re a bigger fool than I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules slid into the plush leather seat of his luxury car, casting Hamilton a look brimming with smug superiority. &#34;As of this moment, I&#39;m severing all ties with the McCoy family.Whatever happens next is your problem, not mine. So if she comes for payback, don&#39;t look to me for help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine roared, and Jules&#39; car disappeared down the driveway, leaving Hamilton standing alone as dusk settled around him. Turning slowly, he caught sight of Daniela on the balcony across the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, their eyes met in the fading evening light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,Hamilton bowed his head, weighed down by defeat and sorrow. &#34;The McCoy family is doomed.&#34;</p>
