                <p>&#34;Whatdid you just say?&#34; Katrina burst out, her voice seething with rage inside the hospital walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just ended a phone call and her first impulse was to unleash her fury on Caiden, but she restrained herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking several deep, calming breaths did little to soften the icy edge in her voice. &#34;Caiden, my cousin just called. Have you really dismissed their whole family from the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was seated on a bench, distress evident as he ran his fingers through his hair. &#34;Daniela stormed into the office today and completely overran my authority!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had braced herself for Daniela&#39;s bold moves against Caiden, yet the extent of the purge took her by surprise. All her carefully placed allies within Harper Group had been ousted overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the outside world, it might appear that only her cousin&#39;s family was tied closely to her,but she had strategically positioned individuals across crucial departments like finance, marketing, and public relations. Now, they had all been swept away wvithout exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s audacity left Katrina reeling. In that moment,she understood just how much she had underestimated Daniela&#39;s capabilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela even mentioned that the villa we acquired for Jack needs to be sold off and the assets liquidated,&#34;Caiden continued, a mix of anger and disbelief in his voice. &#34;She&#39;s also demanding that all the embezzled funds and transferred assets be returned to the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How on earth does she know all these details about our business?&#34; Katrina pressed, incredulity lacing her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How should I know? There&#39;s got to be a spy among us!&#34; The very idea of Daniela tearing apart the company he&#39;d nurtured for more than ten years hit Caiden like a punch in the gut,leaving him seething with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that regard, Daniela was a carbon copy of her mother-cold, calculating, and utterly heartless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown creased Caiden&#39;s brow, his mind a whirlwind of disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s assertive actions earlier had filled him with dread, planting seeds of profound anxiety within him &#34;The funds have been transferred, and the villa&#39;s in our name now. You&#39;re still her father, Caiden. Even if she cuts you off, she wouldn&#39;t drag you into court.Just let her be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, ever the optimist, clung to the hope that Daniela would not abandon Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice was a low murmur, tinged with certainty. &#34;No, Katrina, you don&#39;t understand Daniela.She&#39;s relentless, just like her mother. If we don&#39;t meet her demands,she&#39;ll take legal action without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Katrina scorned Caiden&#39;s timidity inwardly,she maintained a cheerful demeanor. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s not rely on her then. What if I manage it? I can sell the villa and bring back the overseas funds. Would that work for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This suggestion finally brought a sense of relief to Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Caiden had left, Joyce turned to Katrina with a hint of reluctance in her voice. &#34;Mom, all this should be mine. Why should I have to return anything to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she sat beside Jack&#39;s cradle, Katrina&#39;s gaze rested on the newborn, her lips curling into a soft, serene smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry; I know what I&#39;m doing. What belongs to you will always remain yours. No one can take that away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina then leaned forward, engaging playfully with Jack,who responded with joyful giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned from her meeting at Harper Group,her demeanor was noticeably subdued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing this, Lillian turned to Cedric, her voice tinged with concern. &#34;What should we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond; instead, he walked purposefully into the kitchen. Moments later, he returned, bearing a plate of Daniela&#39;s favorite pastries, and gently tapped on her office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the business certificate that had been tarnished and trampled upon lay cleaned and flattened on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the pastries aside, Cedric picked up a damp cloth and began to cleanse every speck of dirt from the certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after restoring it to pristine condition did he place it in a new frame and returned it to its rightful spot on Daniela&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Things that get dirty can be cleaned. What&#39;s  important is ensuring that what&#39;s taken is always returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the warm,ambient light of the office. In Cedric&#39;s serene expression,she recognized something deeply familiar.&#34;Cedric, you remind me of someone I once knew in my childhood.&#34;</p>
