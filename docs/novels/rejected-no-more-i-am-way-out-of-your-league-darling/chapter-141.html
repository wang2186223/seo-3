                <p>Lillian raised an eyebrow. &#34;Is this really such a big deal? You know, if you two ever tie the knot, you&#39;ll be a hen-pecked husband, Cedric. All this drama just because you went back to the office? Keep this up and you&#39;ll shatter that aloof, invincible persona everyone admires!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, shaking his head. &#34;Persona? I&#39;ve never cared about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian was about to reply, Cedric turned to Daniela. &#34;Alright, alright, I admit it-I didn&#39;t go back to the office; I had something else to take care of.Please, forgive me this time.I promise, no more lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a skeptical look, her eyes dropping to his hand. &#34;Were you in a fight? Your hand looks hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned in, her curiosity escalating. &#34;Oh wow you&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, the epitome of composure and precision,had gotten into a brawl? It seemed out of character, but then again, considering his often cold and distant demeanor with others, maybe it wasn&#39;t so far-fetched after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric embodied contradiction, a blend of extremes that rarely made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around Daniela, he was gentle and attentive, yet around others, he was like a simmering volcano on the verge of eruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was oblivious to the fresh scrape marring his knuckles until Daniela pointed it out. He offered a feeble, uncomfortable grin, tucking his hand out of sight behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you head down to the lobby and have the manager get you some iodine for that?&#34; Daniela suggested, her tone laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to dismiss the fuss with a shake of his head, but the sight of Daniela&#39;s earnest  expression halted him. He rose and said, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, unable to suppress her amusement, leaned towards Daniela. &#34;You know, you two really have the whole old married couple act down pat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning, Cedric paused in the doorway,his gaze landing on Daniela, who was quietly sampling the dishes he had placed on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her for a spell, a surge of simple happiness bubbling within him. He didn&#39;t understand why he loved her so deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off his reverie, Cedric finally proceeded to his chair and resumed his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said lightly, &#34;You really should avoid getting into fights, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face softened, his eyes crinkling at the corners. &#34;How about a deal? Be my girlfriend, and not only will I avoid fights, but I&#39;ll hang on your every word and devote myself entirely to you,&#34; he whispered in a voice that no one else could hear. Lillian cast a quick glance at Cedric and asked Daniela, &#34;What is wrong with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. He seems to be in a world of his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Alexander was wheeled into the emergency room. His return to consciousness was marked by agonizing screams of pain that echoed through the sterile corridors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard arrived moments later and was met with a harrowing sight: Alexander&#39;s face, a horrifying tableau of bruises and swelling, distorted beyond recognition. He let out a heart-wrenching cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their cries resonated through the hospital,compelling nurses, doctors, and even other patients to peer into the room, curious about the source of such distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were met with the grim visage of Alexander,sitting on the bed, his features battered and raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, the incident captured the attention of the media. Reporters descended on the hospital, eager for a sensational story. However, Alexander was in no state to confess that he had been mercilessly beaten by a single individual who had nonchalantly continued his evening as if nothing had occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of acknowledging such a humiliating defeat was mortifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The turmoil within him mounted, pushing Alexander to the brink of madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the room emptied and quiet settled once more,he dragged himself to the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronting his reflection, he was rooted to the spot,the severity of his injuries mirroring the turmoil inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch was marred by bruises and swelling,turning his features into those of a man who&#39;d suffered a grave calamity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he realized the source of the excruciating pain that shot through his skin with even the slightest movement. &#34;Cedric is envious because Daniela preferred my looks! That&#39;s why he targeted my face!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard found himself utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, their secretary asked, &#34;Should we call the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard whirled around, his eyes blazing as he fixed the secretary with a stern glare. &#34;Call the police?Have you lost your senses? Just look at his face! If word of this gets out, it&#39;ll be said that the president of Bennett Group was assaulted. Do you want to tarnish our company&#39;s image?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood there, dumbfounded. Cedric was stepping on their dignity, and yet, their primary concern was the company&#39;s image? This was not the Richard and Alexander he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, they wielded their power ruthlessly, lording it over those beneath them. Only last month, Richard had visited a construction site and a mere speck of dust had settled on his suit. Infuriated, he had demanded that the worker responsible compensate him with 100, 000 dollars. That amount represented a whole year&#39;s worth of dedication and labor for the employee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had sunk to his knees, pleading for forgiveness with desperate eyes, yet Richard remained unmoved, his resolve as cold as steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unfortunate worker had driven himself to illness,tirelessly gathering every penny he could muster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now? Alexander&#39;s features were so brutally marred that his own mother wouldn&#39;t recognize him.Yet here they were, forced to digest this bitter pill of defeat without so much as a whimper of resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, witnessing the scene, couIdn&#39;t suppress a twisted sense of satisfaction mingled with curiosity. Who held such sway that they could compel such a complete and humiliating retreat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive gesture, Richard signaled for the secretary to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the door clicked shut behind him, Richard&#39;s gaze hardened as he addressed Alexander. &#34;Don&#39;t hold it against me for not involving the police. You&#39;re aware, just as I am, that our family&#39;s clout has waned.Since we lost the partnership with Elite Lux, we&#39;re not the titan we once were. Crossing Cedric now would spell our doom in Olisvine. For the company&#39;s sake,you must endure this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face, swollen and distorted from the assault, betrayed no emotion. Yet, beneath that battered exterior, a fierce hatred simmered,threatening to boil over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gesturing towards his disfigured face, he snarled &#34;Dad! Cedric didn&#39;t just attack me-he wrecked my face. He&#39;s envious because Daniela shows interest in me, so he targeted every strike at my face. Now, with my face like this, how will I ever win Daniela&#39;s affection back? And what about my standing? Cedric reduced me to nothing. IfI don&#39;t retaliate or even report him, what will others think of me once they hear? They&#39;ll call me a goddamn coward! A spineless loser! How the hell am | supposed to lead when everyone thinks I&#39;ve got no balls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remained silent for a moment, his expression unreadable. He sat there, contemplating deeply as Alexander&#39;s anger simmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, he finally suggested, &#34;Listen, here&#39;s what you need to do-go to Daniela. This chaos all began with her, didn&#39;t it? Demand that Cedric apologize to you. But not just a simple apology-he must also handle all your medical bills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly, calculating gleam flickered in Richard&#39;s eyes.&#34;And while you&#39;re at it, tell Daniela that if she really wants to resolve this situation, she must give us the airport project. That will be the cost of our silence.&#34;</p>
