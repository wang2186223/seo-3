                <p>The one who typically stayed in the kitchen was now battling others</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the fleeting moment of Carol&#39;s surprise, Cedric swiftly took down an opponent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted to Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fighting style felt oddly familiar to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no time for reflection as she dove back into the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, the garden was in chaos, with bulky men scattered on the ground, trampling over countless flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone tried to rise, Daniela cast a fierce glance at the closed door. &#34;Isn&#39;t that enough? If this goes on,someone could end up seriously injured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open slowly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton appeared at the doorway, a smile crossing his face as he looked at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Hamilton had genuinely smiled at Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to be this impressive You truly are a McCoy They mentioned your leg was injured and that you had trouble walking, but it appears you&#39;re even more powerful than those who are in perfect health. Seems like I underestimated you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed quiet, remembering Daniela&#39;s instructions before entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together and stepped behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched the scene unfold, his emotions conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was aware of Daniela&#39;s reputation as the mercenary queen. Throughout the entire chaos, she hadn&#39;t lifted a finger</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t tell whether she was avoiding exposure or if she simply didn&#39;t feel the need to act herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton grinned, &#34;We&#39;ve prepared some delicious food and drinks. Please, come inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deadly glare flashed in Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scarred man beside her immediately noticed,raising his hand to protect Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips.  Hamilton opened his mouth to speak</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela simply turned and walked away in silence,heading back to the car</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car passed the villa and disappeared from Hamilton&#39;s view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary furrowed his brows and said to Hamilton,&#34;Daniela has quite a temper. She just left like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, &#34;What did you expect? Someone at her level wouldn&#39;t have a gentle nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary asked quietly, &#34;Did we push it too far earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were about a hundred bodyguards,some armed with knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I noticed Cedric&#39;s armn was injured,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it, but what of it?&#34; Hamilton replied dismissively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A man must endure some pain to achieve greatness.For my son, an injury is a badge of honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary pursed his lips. &#34;But Daniela didn&#39;t seem to agree. She&#39;s the only one brave enough to show her displeasure in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton smirked. &#34;Joining my family and inheriting my wealth isn&#39;t simple. Don&#39;t worry. In afew days, I&#39;ll  send them some gifts and invite them for dinner That will settle things. Cedric is still part of the McCoy family If he wants my fortune, he must behave like the others and listen to me My wealth isn&#39;t something they can simply take.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary felt uneasy, sensing that Hamilton&#39;s plan wasn&#39;t looking too promising &#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t seem like someone you can easily calm down&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past few days, he had encountered Daniela several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was usually collected and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, for the first time, he saw a deadly glare in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gently advised, &#34;Mr. McCoy, you&#39;re nearing seventy. Since you&#39;ve decided to pass McCoy Group to your sons, why make it harder for them? I&#39;ve noticed they aren&#39;t close to Nikolas anymore. This division among siblings doesn&#39;t bode well for unity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton muttered quietly, &#34;Do you get it? Building a family is easy, but keeping it united is the hard part. If we don&#39;t choose the right heir, how will the McCoy family survive in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary muttered to himself, &#34;I think you just enjoy controlling people. Now that Cedric isn&#39;t under your control, you&#39;re getting uncomfortable and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>causing trouble Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot a glare. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary flinched. &#34;Nothing. Mr. McCoy When do you think we should send medicine to Cedric? That wound looks pretty bad. Shouldn&#39;t we get a doctor to check on it soon? Cedric is new to Oiscoll and unfamiliar with the area. We don&#39;t want any complications, making things harder later on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton dismissed it. &#34;We&#39;ll talk about it in a few days. They need to understand who&#39;s in charge of Oiscoll!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was behind the wheel, heading back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, who was fine, noticed Cedric&#39;s arm and chuckled. &#34;How&#39;d you get hurt? But Cedric, you&#39;re quite skilled. I didn&#39;t know you had it in you. If I had known earlier, Daniela might not have stopped you from coming to Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t answer right away. Instead,he turned and looked at Daniela.</p>
