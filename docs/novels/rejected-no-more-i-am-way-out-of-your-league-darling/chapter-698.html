                <p>Kohen&#39;s words caught Daniela off guard. Her fork froze in mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her head slowly. Her eyes were sharp and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t seem bothered. While adding more food to her plate, he said casually, &#34;I like living off Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen blinked, surprised. He hadn&#39;t expected Cedric to say that. After sneaking a glance at Daniela,he said, &#34;You really know how to joke, Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t bother responding. He gently ladled soup into a bowl and set it in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Daniela sat on the couch watching TV while Cedric got ready to drive the two away. Kohen noticed a note resting on the table and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pointed to the handwriting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This handwriting looks familiar,&#34; he said, picking it up with a grin. Then he read aloud, &#34;Joyce, Daniela&#39;s returning soon. Kill her. Take the inheritance. Use it to wipe away your humiliation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen burst out laughing, completely unaware of the seriousness behind the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his laughter faded, he realized everyone in the room was staring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened up. &#34;What is this supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s calm made Kohen think she wasn&#39;t the type to get emotional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over and asked plainly, &#34;You recognize the handwriting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen missed Nikolas&#39; warning glance and nodded.&#34;Yes.It&#39;s very familiar.&#34;  Daniela tilted her head. &#34;So whose handwriting is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen paused before answering, &#34;It belongs to someone from McCoy Group. I look at hundreds of documents a day. It&#39;s hard to say exactly whose it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked like he had given up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her eyes and asked coldly, &#34;You&#39;re sure it&#39;s someone from McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; said Kohen, holding out the note. &#34;Each person&#39;s writing has unique traits. Look at that little dot at the end. I&#39;ve seen that too many times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the firsttime Kohen saw Daniela smile since arriving. But the smile didn&#39;t warm the room. It was cold, and there was something dangerous in it. That smile held a quiet threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said to Kohen, &#34;Congratulations. You&#39;ve earned the chance to stay. I&#39;ll give you three days. If you can&#39;t tell me whose writing this is, I&#39;ll dig into McCoy Group&#39;s system myself and find the answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen was stunned. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; Daniela spoke without hesitation. &#34;I think someone from McCoy Group is trying to kill me. I need to figure out who it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were vague on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bring up Brylee&#39;s death or the explosion that happened before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying more, she walked upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped into the room and asked, &#34;Why give them three days? We could go find the answers ourselves right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was already at her desk, typing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen&#39;s glow lit her facein a cool, distant hue.She said quietly, &#34;It&#39;ll take at least three days to crack into McCoy Group&#39;s system and pull the data.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen looked over at Nikolas, who seemed more worried than usual, and felt lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously taking Daniela that seriously?McCoy Group&#39;s firewall is one of the best out there. Can she really get through it that fast? Isn&#39;t she underestimating our tech department?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was annoyed. But wouldn&#39;t tell Kohen that Daniela ran the strongest intelligence network in the world. And he certainly wouldn&#39;t tell Kohen that Cedric led Lone Wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped Kohen would keep running his mouth and challenge Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a slow breath. &#34;Daniela used to be the richest woman alive. Elite Lux is still thriving under her. Don&#39;t take her lightly. And you really shouldn&#39;t have said you recognized that handwriting. She might not need to hack anything. If she asks Cedric to go after our family&#39;s fortune, do you think he&#39;d say no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen swallowed the truth and gave a dry laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Cedric really do whatever she says?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen shifted in his seat. &#34;What am I supposed to  do now? This wealth belongs to us. Cedric doesn&#39;t get a piece of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Figure out whose handwriting it is. Hand that person over to Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen frowned.&#34;That&#39;s it? What if I find the person,and she still won&#39;t let go of the fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the McCoy family, after all. They were the richest in the world. Kohen didn&#39;t believe for a second that Daniela would walk away from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes. &#34;Then we take them both out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stared at him, unsettled. &#34;But if Ghost couldn&#39;t do it,who could?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; voice turned cold. &#34;You don&#39;t understand. In this world, death doesn&#39;t always come loud.Sometimes it&#39;s a whisper, a quiet fall, a sudden sickness.You never see it coming.&#34;</p>
