                <p>Daniela turned her eyes away. She rested the fruit platter on her lap and kept eating while the TV played on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, on the other hand, was drowning in a storm of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he had stood firmly against Cedric being with her. He worried she&#39;d twist Cedric around her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it turned out, Daniela didn&#39;t just have control over Cedric. She had the whole McCoy family dancing to her tune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a long breath, thinking at least Daniela was carrying twins-his grandkids. And in his book, that still counted as a win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought worked like a charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, they reached Daniela&#39;s company.Hamilton followed behind Daniela. Brad and Ethan flanked her lke sentries. Josh stood at the front doors,waiting with folded arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned in closer and spoke under his breath.&#34;Don&#39;t you feel weird? There&#39;s a huge crowd out here.&#34; Daniela stayed where she was and gave a small laugh.&#34;Not really. Let the babies get a taste of the real world early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a laugh of his own. For a second,the nerves slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot him a glare as soon as Cedric laughed &#34;You think this is funny? This is serious business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh caught that and let out a smuglaugh.&#34;Serious?Come on, Hamilton. What&#39;s so serious about this? I&#39;m still your big brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton squinted, voice low. &#34;That right? A brother who stabs his own family in the back? That&#39;s not the kind I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s jaw tensed the moment he laid eyes on Josh.He itched to end this once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh smirked and gave him a slow pat on the shoulder.&#34;Ethan, Father always said brains matter most. You treat your head like it&#39;s just forshow. So tell me-who&#39;s that on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nearly lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh said flatly, &#34;I&#39;m not wasting time arguing. I&#39;m here to meet with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes skimmed over the rest of the McCoys and stopped on her. He greeted her casually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a quick nod and walked right past him. &#34;Skip the chitchat. Let&#39;s head to my office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there awkwardly, his hand stuck out for a handshake that never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton couldn&#39;t hold back a laugh. The sight was too good to resist. In the same cool tone Daniela used,he said, &#34;Skip the chitchat. Let&#39;s head to her office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad trailed right behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shot a glance at Josh and added, dripping with sarcasm, &#34;Did you catch that? Let&#39;s move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them waited for him. They piled into the elevator and went up without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stood frozen, stunned. He was the one with the most power in the McCoy empire. And yet,there he was-ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched as he watched them leave. Daniela had just embarrassed him in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spat on the floor and narrowed his eyes.&#34;Daniela!You&#39;Ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton Leaned close, concern flickering in his voice.&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t say anything later. Let me deal with Josh. He&#39;s planned this. He won&#39;t give Ethan&#39;s money back that easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned toward Daniela, then to Hamilton, thinking it over. Hamilton&#39;s years did carry weight. &#34;Maybe he should handle it.&#34; But Ethan shook his head. &#34;And say what? Josh has crushed him for years. It&#39;s only now, thanks to Daniela,that he can finally hold his ground. Let her deal with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh strolled in with a sly grin and dropped onto the sofa without a care. &#34;So. What do you want from me?Make it quick. I&#39;ve got fifteen minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Hamilton took a step forward, his eyes flicking to her. He didn&#39;t speak, but the look said it all -he wanted to handle this.</p>
