                <p>Jules couldn&#39;t explain it, but something in his chest tightened with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, Daniela looked like a nightmare brought to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He composed himself and coughed. &#34;I can tell you,but you&#39;ll have to agree to my terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eased onto a nearby swing,letting her feet brush the earth as it rocked slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Terms are acceptable.&#34; Her tonesharpened into ice.&#34;Though I should caution you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That grin came again-dark, twisted, and brimming with menace beneath the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; pulse jumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;I&#39;m open to negotiations with anyone. I fulfill my promises and accept the cost. But heed this-if there&#39;s deception, you won&#39;t get away with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39;s palm went numb where it hung at his side Daniela caught that reaction and her smirk widened while the swing picked up speed. &#34;Now, talk. What&#39;s your desire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules sensed the devil wore her face, and he was using his secrets to trade with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want Josh&#39;s money,&#34; Jules declared boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules blinked, stunned. It took him a moment to respond, &#34;I mean all of Josh&#39;s money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;Understood.Is there more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules looked completely floored. &#34;You can&#39;t just take his assets like it&#39;s a trinket. Daniela, don&#39;t act so sure of yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like that&#39;s your only wish. I already agreed. If you doubt me, wait three days. Josh&#39;s fortune will legally bear your name. Take that as proof of my promise,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules felt cold creeping from his heels to his scalp.&#34;You&#39;re not joking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slow nod. &#34;Watch and believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From beyond the trees, Brad&#39;s voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped off the swing and, as she walked past  Name Jules, offered a wicked smirk. &#34;Remember this-you only get one wish. Yours is spent. I&#39;ll fulfill my end,but if you fail to deliver, I&#39;ll make sure you suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she disappeared into the dusk, laughing softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules stayed rooted in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as Daniela made her way down the trail,spotting Hamilton and the others rush toward her,voices full of concern. &#34;Where&#39;d you vanish to? You had us worried sick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela twirled a tiny flower between her fingers and replied with a calm smile, &#34;I lost my bearings, but I&#39;m here now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the group drifted away and the sky turned pitch black, Jules finally forced his limbs to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a long breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though he&#39;d signed a pact with something unholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet buried beneath the terror, he felt an uncontrollable thrill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had promised three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In three days, Josh&#39;s wealth would be his.Just three days!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules would become the wealthiest person among his brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pulse thudded like a drum; his veins surged with fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Cedric awaited her arrival. When Daniela walked in, he passed her a piece of fruit. She bit into it,then smiled.&#34;Sweet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, standing nearby, added, &#34;Please don&#39;t pull that again. It&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod and headed to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the others dispersed, Cedric sat beside her and asked, &#34;Did you meet him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34; Cedric pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He says he has proof,&#34; Daniela replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze sharpened to something lethal.&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the dining area, Hamilton watched the two interact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were truly enigmatic. Both unshakably calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when no words passed between them, their energy aligned like they were alone in a world of their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,Hamilton couldn&#39;t stand Daniela. He&#39;d wonder why she acted so fragile, why Cedric always had to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too calculating, always manipulating Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after some time observing them, Hamilton realized things weren&#39;t so simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela did depend on Cedric. Though Cedric often claimed Daniela made all the decisions, he wasn&#39;t completely yielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to safety, Daniela respected the boundary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, the two were attuned-each understanding what the other needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Cedric only the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Elite Lux launched a new concept, Cedric always received the first piece-even if it was yet another black suit. In texture and fit, nothing else  came close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One time, Hamilton approached an Elite Lux designer and asked if he could pay for a suit using Cedric&#39;s material.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The designer responded, &#34;Unfortunately, that fabric is solely reserved for Mr. Phillips-none left for anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,Hamilton learned that the designer only worked for Cedric. When Brad asked Carol how much that cost, she gave a jaw-dropping number. &#34;That&#39;s his yearly fee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad was left speechless, later muttering that he didn&#39;t even earn as much as that designer.</p>
