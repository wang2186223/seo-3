                <p>Hamilton felt a lightness in his chest as he spoke. He had never felt like this in front of Josh before. A short laugh escaped him as he caught the way Josh&#39;s face tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why drag up old grudges now? We&#39;re being pushed around, and as a McCoy, you can&#39;t just watch out for yourself.&#34; Josh always knew how to twist things to his own gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton snorted. &#34;Really now? Funny. Why does that phrase sound so familiar to me? Daniela once said something like... It&#39;s easy to forgive when it&#39;s not your skin on the line. But once you&#39;re the one bleeding, suddenly you can&#39;t let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Hamilton spoke, something clicked inside him.He found himself seeing Daniela&#39;s point clearer than ever. &#34;Back then, our father favored you. He told everyone I was fit to run things, but you got the best share behind closed doors-our ancestral estate and everything else. You enjoyed the luxury while I lived with the weight of his last wishes. Never a moment of peace. Now you think you can say/ &#39;it&#39;s over&#39; and all my resentment burns away? Josh, are you trying to pocket every last scrap for yourself again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had never voiced these words out loud. But after the attack on Daniela and Cedric, he&#39;d woken up to plenty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years, he had carried the McCoy name on his back, while those people leeched off him and still criticized him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, what nonsense is this? Fine. I&#39;ll knock. But don&#39;t run off. You need to see how your daughter-in-law and son behave, so we don&#39;t look like the bullies here.&#34; Hilda McCoy, Hamilton&#39;s sister, stepped forward and went to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already seen Hamilton&#39;s message earlier.With Nikolas and Damon being part of the McCoy family, she had asked them to stay inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Carol were both worn out from the long night, so she&#39;d ordered them to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the McCoy crowd turned up, Daniela was doing yoga in the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the knock, she rose, unhurried, and opened the gate herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were ice, and when the wind caught her hair, it whipped back, framing her face like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda startled at the sight and took a fewsteps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela folded her arms, voice clipped with annoyance. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold stare swept over each face,brows drawing tight.&#34;Speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even standing still, she made it clear who was in charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family shot uneasy glances at each other, but not one of them dared to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph watched them in silence, a faint smirk tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned closer, fighting a grin, and muttered under his breath, &#34;Keep it calm. No drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the silence dragging on, Daniela began to push the gate closed. Josh, eyes darting to Hamilton for help, finally stepped forward and pressed his hand against the gate. &#34;You burned down our ancestral estate, Daniela. You&#39;ll pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his eyes, her tone so calm it cut deeper than any shout. &#34;Who ordered a hundred men to storm my place this morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh swallowed, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Did I not give you fair warning?told you-one hour. Get people to clean up my place.Did you listen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell retorted, &#34;But-&#34; Daniela cut him off. &#34;You&#39;d rather watch your precious mansion go up in flames than lift a finger to clean up my property. I&#39;m ruthless, that&#39;s true. You knew it when you tested me. Now look-your estate&#39;s nothing but ash.Who&#39;s to blame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came soft but landed like ice on bare skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood to the side, half wanting to nod, half wanting to shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela jabbed a finger toward her courtyard.&#34;Since you&#39;re all hereanyway, I don&#39;t have to chase you down. There&#39;s blood everywhere. I&#39;m giving you another hour. If no one handles it by then, I&#39;ll kill Mason next. Did I stutter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s mouth fell open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes swept the entire group, daring anyone to protest. &#34;Each of you owes me. One by one, I&#39;ll collect what&#39;s mine. WVait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother pulling the gate shut. Instead, she flung it wide. Her cold stare pinned Josh. &#34;One hour.Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned, turned her back on all of them,and walked off like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not one McCoy moved. They stood there, wind blowing the coppery smell of dried blood past their noses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They craned their necks, peeking inside at the bloodied flowers and stained stone paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clapped Josh on the back. &#34;Josh, it&#39;s eight now. That leaves you until nine. Who&#39;s cleaning this mess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone turned mocking. &#34;No rush, though. Mason&#39;s half dead already. My kids are fine. You keep whining about reckless moves, but your boy&#39;s as good as gone. His death won&#39;t change a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s face twisted, rage boiling up as he swung on Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton burst out laughing. &#34;What&#39;s this? You find your courage now that Daniela&#39;s gone? She stood here tearing you apart and you stayed quiet as a mouse. Now you&#39;re barking at me? This isn&#39;t right, is it?&#34;</p>
