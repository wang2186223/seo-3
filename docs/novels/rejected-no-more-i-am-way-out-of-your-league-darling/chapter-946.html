                <p>Josh couldn&#39;t shake off the sting of regret. He&#39;d always meant to snatch up more of McCoy Group&#39;s businesses than he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leftovers weren&#39;t much-just a handful of small ventures, nothing compared to the big ones-but even those scraps were tempting to outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Josh shot a glare at his secretary. &#34;Explain.Why did they show up without warning? Even Hamilton had the nerve to appear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hamilton hadn&#39;t come, Josh could have sweet-talked the other clueless McCoy family members in minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Hamilton there, the lies wouldn&#39;t hold.That old fox knew the company inside out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, eyes down, spoke carefully.--′′SiHamilton came straight from Daniela&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes went cold in a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary added, &#34;Daniela&#39;s sharp. She&#39;s been watching MMcCoy Group closely and probably tipped Hamilton off.&#34;Josh slammed his hand on the desk. &#34;Damn that woman! She ruined everything! I planned to strip McCoy Group to the bones. Now I&#39;ve got just half.Damn her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage burning through him, he snapped at his secretary,&#34;Tell the gardeners to plant more jasmines outside Daniela&#39;s villa. I want her gone today. I&#39;m sick of her meddling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been the thorn he couldn&#39;t pull out. If she kept breathing, his grand plans would keep falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary flinched but spoke up. &#34;Mr. McCoy,there&#39;s already a dangerous amount planted around Daniela&#39;s house. If we add more, she might notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a nasty laugh. &#34;Notice what? I said I want her out of the way today. Let&#39;s see how smug Hamilton looks when she&#39;s gone. They think I have no heir. Fine. I&#39;ll make sure the McCoy family can&#39;t have any children in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked the final order. &#34;Go. Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, the secretary obeyed. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela was still in her car when her phone rang. Carol&#39;s voice came through in a rush. &#34;Daniela,don&#39;t come back! The jasmines are so toxic not even stray dogs get close. I turned around the second I saw it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. She told Cedric, &#34;Turn the car around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at Cedric&#39;s face said enough-his look had turned to pure ice at what he&#39;d just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela told Cedric to head straight back to the office and glanced at Carol. &#34;Since Josh wants to play dirty,let&#39;s show him what we can really do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh,meanwhile, got home feeling smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t grabbed every piece of McCoy Group yet,but what he did have was solid enough. He no longer had to throw money around and watch people&#39;s reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sense of power felt too good to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grin, he poured champagne and pushed his bedroom door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blast of jasmine hit his nose. Before he could shout for the housekeeper, the dizziness came hard and fast.He crumpled to the floor, glass shattering beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the crash, the housekeeper ran up in a panic.She found Josh sprawled out, wine soaking into the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to wake him, but Josh barely managed to mumble, &#34;No jasmines...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he blacked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the operating room, the doctor said, &#34;Good thing you brought him in quickly. Any later,we&#39;d have lost him. How did he get poisoned like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question snapped Mason&#39;s patience. His eyes turned murderous. He spat out, &#34;It was a trap!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While doctors worked to stabilize Josh, Mason ordered every inch of the house searched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They found it soon enough-one single jasmine flower tucked inside the air vent. Same poison Josh had spread at the jasmines outside Daniela&#39;s villa. Or rather, the flower was picked from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason wrapped it in plastic, fury boiling over. He stormed toward Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From afar, he spotted workers in gas masks scrubbing the area clean. The jasmines were now nothing but blackened ash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he rushed over, the guards stopped him. &#34;Stop right there! You want to die? What are you doing here?Ms. Harper ordered us to keep the place clear for three days. No one&#39;s allowed near the zone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Mason knew-Daniela had seen through Josh&#39;s tricks from the start. Rage burning in his chest, he spun around and barreled into Daniela&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Daniela&#39;s office, Hamilton was mid-sentence when the door slammed open so hard it rattled the walls.</p>
