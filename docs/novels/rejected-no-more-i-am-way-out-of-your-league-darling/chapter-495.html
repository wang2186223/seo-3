                <p>Daniela was coming on a little too direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease tightened Cedric&#39;s chest, making it hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought to keep his composure, glancing away to avoid locking eyes with her. &#34;You want to divorce me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could utter a word, Cedric shot to his -feet,his emotions slipping out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze for a moment before hearing Cedric&#39;s firm declaration. &#34;I don&#39;t agree!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face darkened, his eyes cooled, but beneath it all lingered a trace of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything felt tangled and messy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric held her gaze, waiting-hoping-she would say something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, all she offered was a short, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained still, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He braced himself, ready to counter any reason</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela threw at him for wanting a divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she insisted...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat in silence, racking his brain for something -anything-he could use as leverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, merely being a source of comfort wasn&#39;t much of a bargaining chip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t exactly say, &#34;If you go through with this divorce, I won&#39;t let you sleep with me anymore,&#34;could he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what if Daniela, cold as ever, agreed without a second thought? He&#39;d just be humiliating himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric realized his biggest disadvantage-he and Daniela had no child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they had, at least he&#39;d say, &#34;If you leave, I&#39;ll take the child with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted never making children a priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought struck him-was Daniela pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught Cedric staring at her stomach,confusion flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric waited a long time, but Daniela didn&#39;t speak again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he said, &#34;Let&#39;s put this on hold and talk later, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected relief stunned Cedric. Had it really been that easy? Then what was the point of everything he endured abroad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to your meeting first. I&#39;ll head home. What do you want for dinner? Should I have Josie make something?&#34; Daniela asked. Cedric answered sluggishly, &#34;Anything is fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela turned to leave, Cedric reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, ornate box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary beamed. &#34;Mr. Phillips picked this up at an auction overseas. A diamond-studded bracelet,engraved with both your initials. Gorgeous piece!Cost him over eight million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot the secretary a look, part amused,part exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary walked off with a knowing grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked Daniela to the elevator. Once inside,she slipped the bracelet onto her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bracelet shimmered under the light, catching Cedric&#39;s eye and pulling a small smile from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew I wanted a divorce, yet you still bought me a gift?&#34; Daniela asked, curiosity laced in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cleared his throat. &#34;You&#39;re the one asking for a divorce. Not me.&#34; Daniela gave a slow nod. &#34;You really know how to treat your wife well,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela was about to step into the car, Cedric caught her hand. His voice dropped to a low murmur.&#34; swear, what happened at the charity gala won&#39;t happen again. Please don&#39;t be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hummed softly in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even look at that person. I just wanted you to care about me more, but I ended up making a mess of everything. Were you feeling unwell that day?&#34;Cedric couldn&#39;t hold back any longer-he pulled Daniela into his arms. &#34;Please, don&#39;t be upset. This is _all on me. I won&#39;t do anything that stupid again. I was an idiot! Don&#39;t leave me. From now on, whatever you say,I&#39;ll listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric drew in an unsteady breath. &#34;But there&#39;s a line, Daniela. You can&#39;t keep throwing yourself into danger.I can&#39;t take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet sigh, her hand resting lightly on his back. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; The entire ride home, Cedric kept his fingers wrapped around Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver glanced at them, thoroughly puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he supposed to just send Daniela back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why was Cedric in the car too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Cedric headed upstairs for a shower.Lillian eyed Daniela. &#34;Didn&#39;t you go to hand over the divorce agreement? How did you both end up coming back together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, Cedric looked even more smitten with Daniela than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a man set on one thing-getting Daniela pregnant just to keep her byhis side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t look like a couple on the verge of divorce,did it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot a quick glance upstairs before slipping the divorce agreement into the drawer like it was no big deal. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34; Lillianfrowned, unused to seeing Daniela hesitate.&#34;So...no divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swapped her shoes and responded lightly,&#34;Hmm. No divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out a knowing sigh. &#34;I figured as much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric, lurking at the top of the stairs, quietly exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was his plan to have a child with Daniela really that obvious?</p>
