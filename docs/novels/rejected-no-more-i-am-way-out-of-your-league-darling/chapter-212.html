                <p>Richard was already consumed by regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Trevor&#39;s words only deepened his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can we do now?&#34; he asked, his tone carrying a weight of grievance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor glanced at the robot beside him, a smug smile spreading across his face. &#34;You know, don&#39;t you?Plenty of families with eligible young men are eager to pair them with Daniela. Why not let your son give it a shot?&#34; She had chased Alexander for a decade. How could she have moved on so suddenly? Sometimes,the heart simply refuses to be controlled. Besides, everyone remembers her marriage to Alexander. A second marriage might draw a few raised brows, but rekindling an old flame is bound to turn heads.Alexander hasn&#39;t married Joyce yet. Why not let him try to win Daniela back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood to the side, his expression bitter. &#34;Things ended badly between us. Daniela says she&#39;s not interested anymore.&#34; His face darkened as the words left him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor noticed that Alexander was reluctant to accept the divorce. &#34;If things ended badly, you should make amends, Alexander. The real test is swallowing your pride. If you do that, you&#39;re ready to handle the worst life throws at you. Make your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These words reminded Alexander of the times Daniela had given him advice during crises at Bennett Group.He remained silent, considering her astute business acumen and how effortlessly she rivaled her male counterparts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Richard kept quiet. Then, he shared his concerns with Trevor. &#34;I&#39;ve seen Daniela since the divorce. She doesn&#39;t seem concerr&#39;ed about us anymore. If she actually ends up remarrying Alexander, I doubt her intentions will be genuine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor laughed. &#34;Once you&#39;re all family, why would she treat you poorly? Daniela is kind-hearted.How bad could she be? Could she be worse than Joyce?&#34; Richard glanced at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor shook his head. &#34;You&#39;ll regret holding back if Daniela marries another man. Did you know an influential figure from the capital visited the exhibition today just to meet her? If you keep hesitating,she&#39;ll choose someone else. I don&#39;t have an unmarried son, or I wouldn&#39;t be telling you this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard pursed his lips, wondering if he was being too cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor went on. &#34;Daniela is a good person. I&#39;ve heard about her helping many lonely, elderly people. How could that be bad? Besides, at our gatherings, shealways insists on paying the bill. Doesn&#39;t that show she respects us a lot? Have you forgotten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remained silent for a long while. As Trevor was about to leave, Richard suddenly spoke up.&#34;Why don&#39;t you help us as a go-between? We&#39;re all friends. If we reconcile with Daniela, wouldn&#39;t that benefit you too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor laughed. &#34;I&#39;d like to help, but Daniela is out of my league now. She&#39;s a prominent figure in the business world and wouldn&#39;t notice me. You should find Marlin. Didn&#39;t his grandson get excellent care at your hospital? Marlin was quite happy with the treatment. He has a strong relationship with Brylee. Maybe if you ask him to speak to Daniela, she might respect him enough to consider a meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded and called his secretary to prepare a generous gift for his upcoming visit to Marlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, who was nearby, overheard everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Richard left, Caiden&#39;s expression darkened with thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela married Alexander, he wouldn&#39;t see a penny of her wealth, and his ties to the Bennett family would be severed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pondered how he would support Joyce and the rest of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, Caiden called Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard Caiden&#39;s news, Joyce became anxious. She changed her clothes and was about to leave when Katrina intervened. &#34;Joyce, think about this. Marrying into the Bennett family without the Harper family&#39;s wealth might not be wise.Let me devise a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,visibly upset, responded, &#34;What plan? I love Alexander. Don&#39;t you want me to marry him? Are you using me to fight for the Harper family&#39;s fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was taken aback. &#34;What are you implying?&#34; She hadn&#39;t realized her daughter would view her actions in such a light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? Dad said the Bennett family wants to be close to Daniela and invited Marlin to mediate.Alexander is amazing, and since Daniela&#39;s divorce, she&#39;s been trying to win him back. Can&#39;t you see what&#39;s happening? If I hesitate, I&#39;ll end up with someone else, perhaps a divorced man. Remember, you didn&#39;t have a dowry when you married into the Harper family, and you brought me into it. How am I different from you back then? Haven&#39;t we lived well for the past decade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was resolute, her frustration evident. &#34;I&#39;m following my heart. Don&#39;t try to stop me because of selfishness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she ran out, her skirt billowing behind her like a whirlwind.</p>
