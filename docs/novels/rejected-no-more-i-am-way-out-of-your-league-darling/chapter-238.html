                <p>Daniela expected Caiden to leave, but instead,he remained in place. Without saying a word, he pulled out a chair and took a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| did love your mother. To say I wasn&#39;t drawn to her wealth would be a lie. But I needed my pride, too.Your mother&#39;s success intimidated me, and honestly,there were moments I felt uneasy. When I married Katrina, I focused only on myself. That&#39;s because I&#39;d been holding back my feelings for too long. I just wanted some breathing space after being suffocated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Daniela&#39;s gaze faltered for a moment.She let out a soft, sarcastic laugh. &#34;Didn&#39;t anyone ever tell you that you can&#39;t have it all? You want an easy life without lifting a finger, but you can&#39;t hate my mother for being successful. You chose Joyce, so don&#39;t expect anything from me. It&#39;s best not to be too greedy.&#34; Caiden opened his mouth to speak, but Daniela cut him off. &#34;Back when I was a kid, other children were picked up by their parents on rainy school days,butl was alone. I&#39;d sit on a tiny bench, wondering why other dads loved their kids, while mine seemed to care more about someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face stiffened, discomfort washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled faintly, a smile that carried a sense of release. &#34;I was stubborn back then. I wrestled with this question for almost ten years before finally letting it go. I just wanted to escape a place that never felt like home. Part of why I treated Alexander well was because I thought he was that boy from my childhnood. But mostly, I wanted to leave, to find a place where | could finally feel like I belonged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice turned bitter as he spoke. &#34;You never said any of this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was nothing to say,&#34; Daniela replied,meeting Caiden&#39;s eyes. &#34;I told you long ago that I&#39;ve outgrown looking up to my father and seeking comfort from him whenever | feel hurt. Don&#39;t expect anything more from me now. I&#39;ve already given all I can. Honestly,I don&#39;t owe you anything else. And if you have any decency left, don&#39;t bring up my mother again. You have no right to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Daniela returned to her documents without another glance. Caiden&#39;s fists tightened as the realization hit him-no amount of words could undo the damage he&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but admit Cedric was right; there was no hope left for mending his relationship with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end,he left without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room fell back into its calm silence until a second glass of milk was placed beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could glance up, someone took the chair Caiden had just left, resting his head on folded arms on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Cedric, surprised to see he was still awake. &#34;Did I wake you?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Cedric replied, his voice rough, carrying a weight that felt heavy in the silence of the room.&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You once told me I did a great job on the North District project. You made a promise back then. Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her expression softening. &#34;Yes, 1remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had poured countless hours into that project,crafting a landmark building that exceeded every expectation. Daniela had been grateful for his dedication and had promised that if he ever needed anything, he could ask, and she would do everything in her power to make it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me that you&#39;d always keep your promise.Does that still stand?&#34; Cedric looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, her eyes meeting his as she asked, &#34;What is it you want, Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Cedric had lingered at the staircase, the weight in his chest almost too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, he saw an image of a stormy night-Daniela sitting all alone in a desolate corridor,waiting for the rain to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image gripped his heart like an unseen hand squeezing it tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been plagued by doubts before, questioning if he had acted too rashly, if his choices had been too extreme, or if things were slipping beyond his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, all those fears melted away. In this moment,nothing else mattered. All he wanted was to pull her into his arms, give her the protection she deserved,and stand as her unwavering shield against the chaos surrounding her.</p>
