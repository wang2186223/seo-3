                <p>&#34;Somewhat,&#34; Kohen replied. &#34;Daniela glanced down,but only for a second. Cedric was right there, so l couldn&#39;t really press the issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was clearly dissatisfied with such a result,though he didn&#39;t let any anger slip through. &#34;Try again.Find a better chance and dig deeper next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Kohen answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hamilton demanded,&#34;And what about Nikolas and Damon? Why do their phones always go straight to voicemail when I call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word from Hamilton dripped with palpable disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing an opening, Kohen decided to fan the flames.&#34;Honestly, they&#39;ve turned into Daniela&#39;s lapdogs.I even reminded them your birthday&#39;s this weekend-told them they should probably get you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed to icy slits as he probed.&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen went on, &#34;They basically said Daniela&#39;s birthday takes priority now. Since they don&#39;t need anything from the McCoy family anymore, your opinion doesn&#39;t matter to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s composure finally shattered. With a howl of rage, he hurled his phone across the room,shattering it against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very same day,McCoy Group launched a ruthless assault on Nikolas&#39; latest business venture</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attack was vicious and unyielding, fracturing Nikolas&#39; financial lifeline and leaving him just a hair&#39;s breadth from declaring bankruptcy right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, a cold, consuming fear gripped him -he&#39;d almost lost a fortune that wasn&#39;t even his,but entrusted to him by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rising in his throat, he rushed into Daniela&#39;s office,complexion drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sense of defeat weighed on his shoulders.He&#39;d never overseen anything of this scale before,and now he was staring down a disaster he couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he were back at home, Hamilton&#39;s look of scorn would be unbearable-he could already picture that icy,disappointed gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Self-loathing churned inside him, dark enough that a part of him wished he could simply vanish rather than face the fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see what&#39;s gone wrong.&#34; Daniela barely glanced up from her work, her tone impossibly calm.&#34;Sit. Give me a minute. We&#39;ll find out what&#39;s broken and see how to fix it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her collected composure caught Nikolas off guard.Carol, quietly attentive, passed him a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands shook as he accepted it, white-knuckled and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave him a reassuring smile. &#34;There&#39;s really no need to panic. Isn&#39;t this just how business goes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a weary breath. &#34;This is a lesson from my father-my mistake to fix. I missed something important and left an opening he could exploit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, completely unfazed by the tension, brushed his concern aside. &#34;You&#39;re not superhuman, you know.You&#39;ve been working yourself to the bone.I heard you&#39;ve barely slept. Look at those dark circles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nikolas was in no mood to dwell on exhaustion.His attention remained locked on Daniela,searching her face for any sign of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never would have imagined, not in a million years,that Daniela would become his last hope, the person he was desperate to lean on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had a twisted sense of humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thorough review of the situation, Daniela summoned a few trusted aides to join her for a quick strategy session. Once they&#39;d hashed out the details,she turned to Nikolas and laid out a plan. &#34;Your father knows you inside and out. That&#39;s why he knows where to strike. Give this method a shot-if it fails, come straight back to me and we&#39;ll figure out the next step together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t the slightest note of blame in her voice -only calm assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nikolas was consumed by guilt, unable to shake off his own self-reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the storm in his eyes, Daniela smiled. &#34;Take a breath and trust yourself. I know you can handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterwards,Nikolas stepped into the hallway, only to be intercepted by Kohen. &#34;So this is it? You&#39;re just going to settle for playing Daniela&#39;s lackey now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot him a frigid glare, the coldness in his eyes answering for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Damon, he couldn&#39;t be so easily controlled. A cold sneer twisted his lips as he faced Kohen. &#34;Kohen,even if I walk away, Father would never hand the reins to you. Do you know why? You don&#39;t have the backbone or the brains for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s forced grin faltered, his confidence visibly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pressed on, his voice low and razor-sharp. &#34;If McCoy Group ever falls into your hands,I&#39;ll make it my mission to bring you crashing down. Why are you so smug now? You don&#39;t have the character for this.Even if you manage to grab hold of the position, it won&#39;t last. You should really take a long, hard look at your own abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing another glance, Nikolas strode away,leaving Kohen standing there-frozen and rattled,unable to pull himself together for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s birthday arrived that weekend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent out invitations to Cedric and Daniela, then turned to Alexander with a calculating glint in his eyes.&#34;Daniela&#39;s afraid of heights. That day, lure her up to the rooftop. The rest will be up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander blinked, confused. &#34;The rooftop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smirk curved Hamilton&#39;s mouth. &#34;Her greatest weakness is heights. You&#39;ve known her this long and never figured that out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked utterly thrown. &#34;She&#39;s scared of heights? Who told you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes glittered with mischief. &#34;You don&#39;t need to know where I heard it. Just trust me-it&#39;s your best shot with Daniela. Leave Cedric to me; I&#39;ll make sure he stays busy in the study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, Alexander remarked, &#34;Cedric isn&#39;t the type to just do what he&#39;s told.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton only laughed, brimming with confidence,&#34;Relax. I have my ways.&#34;</p>
