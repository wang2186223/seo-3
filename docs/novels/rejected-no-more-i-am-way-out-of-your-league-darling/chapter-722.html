                <p>After dinner, Cedric was on his way to engage Daniela in a conversation when Carol abruptly entered the room.She gestured toward the entrance and said, &#34;Daniela, you have a visitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up, curiosity flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous grin, Carol teased, &#34;Take awild guess-who gave in first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, Daniela rose gracefully from her seat. &#34;Kohen,&#34; she replied, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Carol gave a dramatic thumbs-up. &#34;Spot on! I was sure Charles would be the one to crack under the pressure. Isn&#39;t Kohen supposed to be Nikolas&#39; staunchest ally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela approached the doorway, she spoke with a chilling detachment.&#34;The closer the bonds appear,the greater the danger lurking beneath them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a world where elite families vie for power and wealth, who could truly shun temptation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric might be the only exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before crossing the threshold, Daniela turned her head slightly, stealing a final glance at Cedric, who stood frozen inside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met momentarily, and though Cedric&#39;s gaze lingered, Daniela broke it off without hesitation,striding out the door decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,trailing slightly, looked back several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like Cedric&#39;s on the verge of tears. Isn&#39;t this a bit too cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips tightened, and she kept walking, her silence heavy with unspoken thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, deep down, she understood the gravity of her decision. If she wavered now, Cedric might join the McCoy family-a choice that should come from him alone, not swayed by her actions. The weight of such love was more than she was prepared to shoulder at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained quiet, striding forward with such determination that Carol couldn&#39;t help but shiver slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen lingered outside, bundled in a coat yet still in his striped hospital attire, evidently straight from a medical visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon spotting Daniela emerging, Kohen moved towards her with eagerness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rapid steps brimmed with confidence, as though he had already ascended to the CEO position at McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; he called out again, his voice buoyant with a hint of apology. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the late intrusion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze steadily, her expression unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred by her stoic look, Kohen flashed a grin. &#34;Does what you mentioned back at the hospital still count?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded him calmly. &#34;It does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s-face brightened immediately.11SO1,you think I&#39;m fit for the role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a brief glance at him before breaking into a soft chuckle. &#34;And what exactly are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hurried to explain, his voice earnest. &#34;I aim to take the helm of McCoy Group. Do you think I&#39;m up to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the task?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression unreadable, Daniela casually took a seat on the bench outside the villa, her posture relaxed yet commanding. &#34;I don&#39;t lend my support to the inept. Demonstrate your capabilities, your resolve, and the value you bring to the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen felt the sting of her skepticismn; she clearly doubted his competence. &#34;Sometimes, what are perceived as shortcomings can be advantageous. My straightforwardness makes me more manageable for you, doesn&#39;t it? You wouldn&#39;t want a puppet who suddenly cuts his strings. You need a loyal executor, and that I can be. I&#39;m aware of your ongoing investigation into the explosion incident. Consider me your dedicated soldier. Once we pinpoint the mastermind, I&#39;ll handle them decisively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm and composed. &#34;And if the mastermind turns out to be your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Kohen asserted, &#34;No matter who it is, they will face justice. Errors must be rectified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes alight with a fierce determination,hinting at a readiness to act with lethal force.</p>
