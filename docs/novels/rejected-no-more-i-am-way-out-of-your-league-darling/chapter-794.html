                <p>Nikolas ground his teeth in frustration. &#34;I never imagined Cedric could be this powerful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen questioned, &#34;What made you assist Cedric with the construction project back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles joined in, &#34;That&#39;s right! Now, everyone&#39;s calling their building the most breathtaking landmark in Oiscoll!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran added with a smirk, &#34;Nikolas, you really screwed this one up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas seethed with anger. &#34;Now you all have opinions? When Cedric asked me for people and materials, you said I could agree and it didn&#39;t matter.You even recommended giving him extra resources,believing that with McCoy Group&#39;s monopoly in Oiscoll,he&#39;d never accomplish anything. But now, he&#39;s out there in front of the media, humiliating McCoy Group, and I can&#39;t even look Dad in theeye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell over the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Damon remarked casually, &#34;It&#39;s not just that you can&#39;t compete with Daniela. You can&#39;t even handle  Cedric. Have you realized something? When Daniela was around, Cedric seemed to fade into the background. But once she was gone, his true potential emerged. Now, people are saying that the McCoy family has raised a bunch of useless heirs and should hand over the company to Cedric before Daniela&#39;s new venture became the world&#39;s most successful company, bringing even more disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his teeth. &#34;Damon, whose side are you on? Even if Daniela is your idol, you can&#39;t be this one-sided! We&#39;re your brothers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon chuckled. &#34;Aren&#39;t I just telling it like it is? Plus,Cedric&#39;s my brother too.&#34; In that sense, Daniela was also family to him. The thought pleased him immensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas closed his eyes, asking, &#34;So, what do we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon continued, &#34;I suggest you hold off on making any moves. Cedric&#39;s ruthless. He made it clear that if I didn&#39;t provide the materials, he&#39;d go straight to Dad.And I had no choice but to comply&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen muttered,&#34;What can we do? I think Dad&#39;s taken quite a liking to Cedric. He&#39;s even considering handing McCoy Group over to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles added, &#34;At the banquet yesterday, someone complimented Cedric. Dad actually smiled with approval. Someone even mentioned Cedric&#39;s methods resemble his own, and he agreed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt the weight of the threat and responded,&#34;We need to come up with a plan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen proposed, &#34;We need to keep Daniela from coming back If they team up, we won&#39;t stand a chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon quickly inquired, &#34;What&#39;s your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing that would hurt your idol,&#34; NVikolas said with narrowed eyes. &#34;Just manipulating the entry information to keep Daniela out for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood by the floor-to-ceiling window,staring at the building across the street, a smile playing on his lips. &#34;It brings back memories of my own past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded in agreement. &#34;Cedric&#39;s truly impressive. I heard several more partners switched sides today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded, puffing on his cigar. &#34;Any updates from Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary answered, &#34;Alexander&#39;s been sent to Elite Lux to locate Daniela. Once our people get a photo, they&#39;ll send it right over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded, his admiration for Cedric evident. He turned to his secretary &#34;What do you think of the name Cedric McCoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary smiled. &#34;It definitely sounds like the name of a McCoy heir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled</p>
