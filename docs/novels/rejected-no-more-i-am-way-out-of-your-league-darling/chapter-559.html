                <p>An hour had passed. Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees continued their relentless smear campaign against Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, an anonymous post surfaced, telling a shocking story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shocking Revelation! A CEO, once bankrupt and twice-divorced,mysteriously amassed wealth after a former wife disappeared, inheriting her massive fortune. He traveled abroad for plastic surgery,carrying a photo of another ex-wife&#39;s current husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This post sparked rapid speculation. One clever commenter said, &#34;A CEO down on his luck, twice-divorced, with an ex-wife married to another? Coming into a fortune? Could this be Alexander Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the post gained traction, employees from Phillips Group and Elite Lux scrambled to refocus the public&#39;s wrath on Cedric, dismissing the revelation as mere distraction. &#34;Ignore this rubbish! Stay focused on denouncing Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observers suspected a deflection tactic and escalated their insults.  Simultaneously intrigued, they began tracking the whistleblower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the anonymous source uploaded a blurry video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It depicted a man in a suit, departing the Bennett family&#39;s residence and proceeding to a press event. He wore a mask,yet his build bore a striking resemblance to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This left everyone puzzled and questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees maintained their stance. &#34;Stay focused! Continue to target Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,skepticism was mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions arose about why Cedric would be seen leaving Alexander&#39;s residence at such a late hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These suspicions, combined with earlier rumors about plastic surgery, sparked a wave of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as the public attempted to delve deeper,Phillips Group and Elite Lux staff persisted in their attacks on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An onlooker suggested, &#34;Maybe you should look into this. What if Cedric is being set up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s PR team, responding from their  official account, dismissed the concerns. &#34;Look into what? The situation is clear. What would anyone gain by impersonating our CEO? Just to show up at a press event and cause a rift between him and his wife?Highly unlikely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notion began to take root. &#34;Could it actually be possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s continued attempts to reconnect with Daniela and his expressions of wanting to reunite,despite her disregard, led to wild speculation. Had he lost his grip on reality over Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR team of Phillips Group scoffed at the idea.&#34;That&#39;s absurd! Who would go to such lengths? Keep focused;continue the attack on Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the incident, there was a noticeable drop in the volume of insults hurled at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the slander persisted among many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the whistleblower&#39;s account  was deactivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion spread among the online crowd. &#34;Wait,why was that account banned? Was it on to something real? Could Alexander really have undergone surgery to mimic Cedric, especially with the recent video showing &#39;Cedric&#39; leaving the Bennett family&#39;s residence? This is getting weird. Now, I&#39;m really  starting to question everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees continued to instigate, &#34;Come on, keep up the attacks! Don&#39;t let up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bystander expressed frustration. &#34;Why are you all relentlessly attacking him without seeking the truth?I&#39;m starting to feel bad for Cedric. What kind of employees does Elite Lux have? Cedric is Daniela&#39;s husband; shouldn&#39;t you be supporting him instead of adding to his troubles? Daniela, how can you allow your staffto behave like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, a Phillips Group employee retorted,&#34;Stay on target! Keep the insults coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An employee of Elite Lux said, &#34;Aren&#39;t they supposed to be getting a divorce? Daniela is currently too distraught, locked up in the bathroom, unable to oversee anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One individual openly addressed Daniela online,saying,&#34;You&#39;re the wealthiest in the world! Dry those tears!There&#39;s still a chance to turn things around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her verified account, Daniela responded,&#34;Thanks to everyone for your support, yet what am l to do? After all, I am merely a woman. Could everyone lend a hand in investigating this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This response raise an image of Daniela as a delicate figure, overwhelmed by her marital distreSS. The sight of such distress in a woman as admired as Daniela moved people profoundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, tech experts across the globe initiated a thorough examination of the surveillance systems around Bennett Group, managing to infiltrate all the security cameras that very night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite these developments, the staff at Phillips Group and Elite Lux were undeterred, continuing their efforts to incite further negative attention. &#34;Stay here!Enjoy bashing him! I&#39;ll even pay the bill for your comments!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their calls went unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux remained active in their denunciations of Cedric on social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the scandal subsided and fell from the trending charts, prompting Phillips Group to purchase a spot to keep the issue alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observers were flabbergasted,publicly advising Cedric,&#34;With the scandal winding down, perhaps it&#39;s time for a staff overhaul. What leader could tolerate such betrayal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chose not to reply to these comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff at Phillips Group glanced at the incendiary  messages with concern and turned to Daniela. &#34;With all this cursing, won&#39;t our boss give us a hard time later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a reassuring smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.Instead, I&#39;ll give each of you a bonus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, she made a generous transfer to everyone in the group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each member received ten thousand dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their spirits lifted instantly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insults escalated to such extremes that even those not involved felt compelled to turn away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a new revelation surfaced online under the headline &#34;Shocking Revelation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post said, &#34;A chief surgeon friend of mine from overseas just informed me about a case a few months back. A man from Olisvine, not yet a CEO and reportedly bankrupt at the time, received plastic surgery funded by a woman. Both were somewhat unstable mentally. Due to patient confidentiality, l can&#39;t reveal his name, but the surgery documents list his emergency contact as a Ms. Holt, who seems to be his new spouse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This explosive information skyrocketed up the trending list. Another netizen then added, &#34;Everyone, I&#39;m just an ordinary observer. Out of concern for Daniela, who seems overwhelmed, I decided to hack into the surveillance around Alexander&#39;s residence. Recently,there have been frequent meetings there with the commerce association. Given that Daniela has paused her company acquisitions during this scandal, I believe there&#39;s a connection. Moreover, I&#39;ve accessed 24-hour surveillance footage from around Elite Lux,showing Cedric consistently returning home nightly,including the evening of the press conference.There&#39;s no evidence of him leaving at all that night. I&#39;m convinced the man at the press conference and the one at the nightclub wasn&#39;t Cedric. People, let&#39;s not rush to judgment without knowing the full story!&#34;</p>
