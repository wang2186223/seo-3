                <p>Cedric&#39;s words hit like ice, freezing Hamilton&#39;s expression in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint twitch ran through the creases of Hamilton&#39;s aged face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apologize to Daniela in front of the media?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked,half-convinced he&#39;d heard wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He managed a strained smile. &#34;Come again? I must&#39;ve misheard you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cast his eyes downward,casually tightening his watch strap like he had all the time in the world.&#34;You heard me loud and clear. I said apologize to Daniela in front of the media. This offer&#39;s a one-time deal. Miss your shot now, and I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t get another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s forced grin finally cracked. &#34;Cedric, I&#39;m still your father. Don&#39;t you think this is too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a sharp sneer. &#34;Father? I&#39;ve never acknowledged you as one, and I never will. The moment you hurt my wife, you made yourself my enemy.You asked me here, and I came. I gave you a chance-if you waste it, don&#39;t blame me for walking away. And let me make it official, the McCoy family&#39;s downfall will mirror Alexander&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric rose, his movements steeped in quiet pride and firm resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His towering frame and magnetic aura pulled every gaze from the women in the restaurant like a tide drawn to the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fastened his jacket, pivoted smoothly, and strode away without sparing a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face drained of color, fury turning his features ghostly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around and slapped Kohen across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen reeled, eyes wide. &#34;Father, why did you strike me?&#34; He hadn&#39;t done anything to provoke his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s biting words had left Hamilton seething, his pride torn to shreds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, he jabbed a finger at Kohen&#39;s nose.&#34;Useless!I told you to bring Daniela! Why did Cedric show up instead? You&#39;ve embarrassed me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his way out, Hamilton lashed out with a vicious kick that sent Kohen stumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen collapsed onto the floor, his fists trembling as he glared at Hamilton&#39;s fading silhouette. Cedric returned to the company, instinctively looking for Daniela before starting work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he pushed open the door, the office greeted him with nothing but silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s my wife?&#34; Cedric asked, his tone edged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary answered, &#34;She mentioned she was feeling drowsy and left with Carol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked in surprise, glancing at the clock-only 7 PM. &#34;Tired already? At this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded. &#34;Yes, she&#39;s been unusually sleepy these days. She even napped at her desk earlier. After finishing the meal you sent,she played a new game on the sofa for a bit, then said she was tired and left for home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s chest tightened with unease the moment he heard those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave up on work and headed straight home without another thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived, the living room was bathed in the soft glow of a single dim yellow lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon and Carol were immersed in a game, while Nikolas leaned in, briefing Daniela with data reports.Daniela lay stretched out on the sofa. Cedric approached quietly and peered down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, enough talking,&#34; Cedric said to Nikolas. &#34;She&#39;s asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas froze, eyes dropping. His expression darkened instantly. &#34;All that time briefing on the new company...was it all for nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced over. &#34;Why is Daniela so sleepy again?Last night, she dozed off halfway through the game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked to Cedric with a pointed look. &#34;Are you wearing her out in bed? Don&#39;t be so greedy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt wronged but didn&#39;t want to discuss his private life with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down and gently lifted Daniela into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyelids fluttered open just enough to see Cedric. She clung to his neck softly, whispering,&#34;Sleepy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric carried her upstairs, poised to tuck her in and settle beside her, when a sharp knock sounded on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Cedric called out, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; voice was urgent. &#34;This plan is critical-it could decide the fate of my new company. Can you get Daniela up to listen?&#34; Anxiety crept over his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned. &#34;She&#39;s invested in it, sure. But can&#39;t you handle the decisions yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas answered without hesitation, &#34;I&#39;ve never handled a project this big with so much money involved. If it falls apart, I&#39;ll be terrified. I&#39;m begging you-just this once, please wake Daniela. Without her guidance,I honestly don&#39;t feel confident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,he tried to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric held up a hand, his patience thinning. &#34;Go downstairs first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas protested, &#34;But I really-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cut him off firmly.&#34;Go downstairs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Begrudgingly, Nikolas backed away, glancing over his shoulder with pleading eyes. &#34;Please, make sure Daniela wakes up. It&#39;s critical-I really need her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Nikolas left, Cedric gently checked Daniela&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed a soft kiss across her cheek and whispered,&#34;Are you feeling alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela murmured, &#34;Just tired. Let me rest.&#34; Cedric kissed her again tenderly. &#34;Alright, sleep well.I won&#39;t disturb you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped back into peaceful slumber</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped onto the balcony and called the family doctor right away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor told him to keep a close watch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading down. Cedric checked Daniela&#39;s forehead once more- no fever. Then he descended the stairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the stair landing. Cedric caught Carol&#39;s voice &#34;Nikolas, I bet only Cedric will come down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric made his way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked desperately after Cedric,seeing no one else follow. his face darkening with worry.&#34;What are you doing here? I need to speak with Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cednic grabbed the plan from Nikolas&#39; hands. &#34;Tell me everything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hesitated. &#34;You? What could you possibly understand?&#34; He finished with a contemptuous snort.</p>
