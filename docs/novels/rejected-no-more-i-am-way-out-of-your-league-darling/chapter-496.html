                <p>Cedric had just showered, smelled great, and was determined to have a baby with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted Daniela to know that someone in this world truly loved her and needed her just as badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This might make her take her life more seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his shower, Cedric came out, leaving a light scent in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the door and stopped for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His purpose was crystal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, confused at the doorway, asked, &#34;Daniela?Weren&#39;t you supposed to change? What&#39;s holding you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a gentle smile, walked into the room,and shut the door, leaving Lillian outside, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric stood wearing only a towel around his waist, his chest exposed. Water droplets from his shower lingered on his skin, trailing down his chest and vanishing into the towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela inhaled deeply, just as she was about to approach him, Lillian&#39;s voice reached through the door. &#34;Daniela, are you ready? The car&#39;s downstairs.The mental hospital just called. Caiden tried to end his life. We need to hurry, or we might lose him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian finished, Daniela noticed Cedric stiffen for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a shy, apologetic smile. &#34;Can we maybe do this some other time? There&#39;s a lot I need to take care of today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused for a moment, then asked hesitantly,&#34;Do you mind if I come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question was a cautious dip into the unknown waters of Daniela&#39;s private life. Despite being her husband, Cedric always felt excluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He prepared himself for a possible rejection. Yet, it was all part of his strategy. He understood that the journey ahead would be a long one,recognizing that their struggles would be a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Daniela agreed with a simple&#34;okay,&#34; Cedric was taken aback for a good while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After changing, Daniela saw Cedric still rooted to the spot and asked, &#34;Aren&#39;t you coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric snapped out of his daydream and quickly began to prepare himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Lillian kept sneaking glances at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She texted Daniela, &#34;Why is Cedric here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela texted back, &#34;Is there an issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian continued, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say Cedric wasn&#39;t supposed to know about these things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the sudden change of heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Lillian&#39;s message and then at Cedric next to her, who was barely hiding his grin.She shook her head with a resigned smile. She had kept Cedric out of her world because it was filled with unspeakable things, and she wanted to preserve his innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he was eager to be a part of every aspect of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once considered divorce, but she found herself unwilling to leave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, she chose a new approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her strategy was to bring Cedric to her world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated again with another text from Lillian. &#34;Aren&#39;t you worried you might frighten him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, then whispered, &#34;Let&#39;s see how it goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric missed her murmur and asked, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the mental institution was long, and the road narrowed along the way. Cedric sat quietly throughout. Daniela remained silent as well, her stillness weighed down by a sense of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sign at the entrance of the institution was crooked, hanging off-center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words &#34;Shadowpeak Madhouse&#34; were scrawled in a hurried manner, while weeds outside had grown taller than a person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old iron fence gave off a sinister air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last visit here had left Elyse and her daughter ill for days from the terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, Daniela left Cedric with no other options. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was eager to reveal her true world to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped forward immediately, with Lillian following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled in a strange, haunting manner,carrying the stench of rotting flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they crossed the courtyard and entered the building, cries of despair echoed down the vacant halls the moment they crossed the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bearded man greeted them with a smile. &#34;You&#39;ve come!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is he?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man gestured towards the farthest ward. &#34;He was desperate, found a glass shard, and nearly bled out after slicing an artery. He kept calling for you, sol figured I&#39;d better inform you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nod. The man then turned to Cedric,offering a nod of recognition as if recalling an old acquaintance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swung open the door to the ward. Inside,Caiden was lying on his back, his face pale, eyes fixed on the ceiling. &#34;Daniela! You deserve to die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprang to his feet, ready to charge at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze hardened as he stepped in to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden came to a sudden halt. &#34;Cedric? Is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained firm, his face hardening with determination. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela brought you here! Cedric, look at me. See how I suffer? | am Daniela&#39;s biological father, yet she despises me, and not just me but everyone. Do you know why she returned after her divorce from Alexander? She came for vengeance, for her mother&#39;s death. She&#39;s malevolent, the architect of all this cruelty! Behold, I&#39;m just a shell of the man I once was. And the woman you think is a pure, innocent soul? She&#39;s heartless, a true villain! Daniela is a devil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden let out a crazy howl, his voice echoing off the decaying walls, a painful sound to the ears. &#34;Look at the truth, Cedric! My life is just a glimpse of what&#39;s to come for you!&#34; How can you love such a woman? It&#39;s foolish. You should leave her, escape this monster.Daniela, you&#39;re trying to kill your own father. You deserve a miserable, joyless fate, cursed for eternity.&#34;Caiden&#39;s wild outburst echoed throughout the crumbling building, with each shout hitting like a physical blow.</p>
