                <p>Fury burned in Elyse&#39;s eyes, her face contorted as she struggled to contain her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep sigh, she sought to calm her voice.&#34;Well.people have different tastes, don&#39;t they? Daniela might favor men who are strikingly handsome or quite the opposite. It&#39;s hard to say for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the reporter gearing up to ask another question, Elyse quickly rose and offered a fleeting smile. &#34;Could we perhaps discuss this privately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She discreetly slid the last ten thousand dollars she had into his pocket, prompting a compliant grin from the reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters, sharp as ever, quickly caught on to Elyse&#39;s intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared knowing smiles and went on to order dish after dish without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, when Natalie and her mother saw the bill,they almost gasped in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bill totaled a staggering five million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is outrageous!&#34; Natalie scowled, poised to confront them. However,Elyse held her back. &#34;Let it go. Once Daniela is out of the picture, this will be just a small expense for Elite Lux. These journalists have influence, and we&#39;ll need their support to shape our image after she&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling sharply, Natalie rolled her eyes. &#34;They act like parasites! I&#39;ll reclaim every dime once I take over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse brushed off the concern with a wave of her hand and said, &#34;It&#39;s time. Let&#39;s make our move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They used their card to unlock the hotel room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked in to find the room in complete chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over Natalie while Elyse smirked in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room&#39;s dim lighting barely revealed Daniela under the quilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse scanned the room and flashed a suggestive grin at Linden. &#34;Had a good time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden sprawled casually in an armchair near the curtains. &#34;Not too shabby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly laugh, Elyse laid out the plan. &#34;I&#39;m about to storm in with the press. Strip down, grab Daniela,and ensure she&#39;s alone when she exits the hotel. Then, find an opportunity to end her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was plotting as ever. Her plan was to rise to power at Elite Lux after Daniela&#39;s demise would leave Cedric shattered by perceived betrayal. Claiming the role of Daniela&#39;s aunt had been a long-conceived strategy to enable her takeover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a confident grin,Elyse was ready to implement her master strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning with a puzzled expression,Elyse faced Linden.&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something I don&#39;t understand. Did you have a hand in Brylee&#39;s death?&#34; Linden asked, eyeing the figure in the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile vanished from Elyse&#39;s face. &#34;Why would you bring that up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonchalantly,Linden responded, &#34;Out of curiosity.I&#39;m on your payroll, after all. It&#39;s puzzling how you could target her daughter, given Brylee&#39;s past kindness to you.Could you shed some light on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face hardened, her tone cold. &#34;What&#39;s there to clarify? I was after their wealth, and they were too affluent for their own good. I ended Brylee&#39;s life, and Daniela&#39;s end will be by my hands as well-her fate will mirror her mother&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Elyse exited without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt something was off with Linden today.She couldn&#39;t pinpoint what, but something was definitely wrong. After exiting the room,she lingered by the door,ear pressed against it, while keeping an eye on the room&#39;s surveillance feed on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the room, as Linden saw the coast was clear,he prepared to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he caught Daniela slowly opening her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharp, she subtly mouthed the word &#34;Surveillance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden immediately sat back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Óutside, Natalie watched for a long time. Only the sound of water running eventually convinced her to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, already at the elevator, chuckled, &#34;You&#39;re too wary. Didn&#39;t the disarray convince you of last night&#39;s escapades? It was just like when Nina and Linden were together.What&#39;s there to worry about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a sly smile, Elyse continued, &#34;Soon, I&#39;ll be leading Elite Lux. I&#39;ve even had Daniela&#39;s authorization papers forged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse then gestured to the waiting reporters. &#34;Let&#39;s move. It&#39;s time to get to work!&#34;</p>
