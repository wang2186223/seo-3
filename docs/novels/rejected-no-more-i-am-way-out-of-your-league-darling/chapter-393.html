                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression instantly soured. &#34;I couldn&#39;t care less who you are! Where is Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t here. He said he had already settled the payment with you, and today, I&#39;m here to learn how to make the rose pastries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie began to walk away, but the hypnotist behind her chuckled, asking, &#34;Should I still assist you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Natalie got home, Nina had already heard the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sitting on the sofa, peeling an orange. She looked up at Natalie and sneered. &#34;What,Cedric didn&#39;t bother to show up? I figured you&#39;d be coming back as his girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Natalie crossed the room and slapped Nina hard. &#34;Bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a laugh, clearly unfazed. &#34;Bitch? Then what does that make you? A thief who takes what isn&#39;t yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie,burning with anger,retorted,&#34;What&#39;s with that smug look? Cedric probably didn&#39;t even know I was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>coming, which is why he didn&#39;t show. It only proves that he isn&#39;t into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remained unbothered, feeling quite pleased. &#34;Oh really? If Cedric doesn&#39;t care about me, then he definitely doesn&#39;t care about you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension finally exploded, and the two women were soon locked in a heated argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse tried to intervene but was quickly slapped hard during the chaotic scuffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, she couldn&#39;t help but wonder how she ended up with two daughters so fixated on romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Cedric needed to be handled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, Elyse grabbed her phone and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Cedric had been picking Daniela up after work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the driver taking some time off, he was driving himself, and Daniela was sitting in the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they made their way halfway down the road, Cedric suddenly felt something strange with the brakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to pull over and check when, out of nowhere, a truck came speeding towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to think, no time to react.  Instinctively,Cedric threw his body over Daniela,trying to shield her from the impending impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, the sleek, expensive car was torn apart, reduced to a twisted heap of scrap metal,surrounded by a thick cloud of smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was in the crowd, watching from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard Daniela&#39;s frantic voice and saw as the medical team rushed to Cedric&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed close, accompanying her unconscious husband into the ambulance, her presence commanding the scene. As she stood by the ambulance, she cast a cold, sweeping glance at the onlookers, her eyes narrowing as they landed on one particular person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,through the smoke and biting cold wind, she let her lips curve into a slow, calculating smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance sped off, leaving the scene behind,but Elyse remained standing, her body tense. She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Daniela had seen her in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that seemed impossible. She had been standing outside the crowd, with the police line separating them,making it unlikely Daniela had noticed her from that far away. Elyse decided to leave and turned her car around,but as she hit the gas, an explosion suddenly shattered the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deafening blast echoed across the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly looked up to see chunks of metal from the blast soaring high before coming back down with a crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosion sent the crowd into a frenzy, with the onlookers ducking and covering their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once dark sky was now burned with an intense red glow from the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat outside the operating room, tense and still,waiting for Lillian and theothers to arrive before she finally stood up, her movements shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She played the video of the accident, her eyes glued to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you should get some rest. Ryan and I can handle things here,&#34; Lillian suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched the entire video without a word,then shoved her phone back into her pocket. A cold,menacing aura surrounded her. &#34;I want the Dury family to pay dearly for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian could only pray in silence, hoping Cedric would  pull through-because if he didn&#39;t, Daniela might truly lose herself.</p>
