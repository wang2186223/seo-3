                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Nikolas remarked, his gaze piercing into Cedric&#39;s, laden with a veiled threat. &#34;You better tread carefully, Mr. Phillips. Explosions might be rare, but when they occur, they can get you killed. You might not be so lucky next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere tensed as Cedric&#39;s secretary bristled with suppressed fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas continued, &#34;I&#39;ve heard the whispers that you&#39;re an orphan, unsupported and hopeless. That must be hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation had spiraled from professional to profoundly personal-a blatant assault on Cedric&#39;s character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain his outrage any longer, Cedric&#39;s secretary looked as though he was on the brink of exploding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, visibly irritated yet composed, recalled Caiden&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s words from earlier that day,opting to bear the brunt of the verbal onslaught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to prove himself, to earn Clarinda&#39;s approval to pursue his own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering Nikolas a tight, controlled smile, Cedric chose silence over confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, mistaking the silence for weakness, smirked with a sense of victory. &#34;Rumors abound that you&#39;re a cold,ruthless man, not easily swayed or crossed. Yet,it appears that&#39;s a misconception. You&#39;re not particularly tough to negotiate with. It&#39;s just that their offers haven&#39;t been alluring enough. Now that the stakes are worthwhile, you seem to be bending.You&#39;re not as formidable as they say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary clenched his fists, eyes shut tight,teetering on the edge of wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised a hand, signaling him to pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric was about to respond, a new voice,cool and deliberate, cut through the tension. &#34;Mr.McCoy, this hardly seems like a business discussion.You&#39;re acting more like a gossipmonger than a professional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; icy gaze landed on the stranger who had emerged before him. His brow furrowed in suspicion.&#34;Who exactly are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary straightened his posture. &#34;This is Daniela Harper!&#34; There was a brief, tense silence before Nikolas asked,&#34;You&#39;re the former world&#39;s richest person, Daniela Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give a damn about the title. I didn&#39;t expect you to care so much,&#34; Daniela retorted, her voice as cold as the air between them. &#34;As for Cedric, whether he appears unsupported and hopeless, you&#39;ll soon grasp the reality quite thoroughly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was taken aback, momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,given Daniela&#39;s prior status as the wealthiest individual globally, he felt compelled to maintain a veneer of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Displaying too much arrogance could provoke his father&#39;s rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in the car,&#34; Daniela insisted, nodding towards Cedric. &#34;Let&#39;s make sure our distinguished guest reaches the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric slid cheerfully into the car, Daniela stepping in after him, and Cedric&#39;s secretary settling in last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed her gaze on Nikolas, who remained outside.&#34;Mr. McCoy, do you have your own car? Shall we lead the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming silently, Nikolas reluctantly climbed into the vehicle. Born into wealth, the discomfort of sitting in the cramped back row of a seven-seater was unfamiliar to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shuffled awkwardly, trying to find a way to position his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finally made it to the hotel just across from the Phillips Group building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas cast a skeptical glance at the building&#39;s entrance. &#34;You&#39;re putting me up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed him a playful smile, her eyes twinkling with amusement. &#34;What&#39;s the matter, Mr. McCoy? Is this place a bit too posh for your tastes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas crossed his arms, his stance exuding pure condescension. &#34;I don&#39;t do hotels. I&#39;m strictly a villa kind of man. I require personal attendants for my meals and daily necessities. Anyway, hotels are disgusting dumps. Who knows how many have slept in the same bed, or whether there are secret cameras lurking? Do you even realize who I am? If something were to happen to me in a place with such poor security, could you handle the fallout?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary, who had been silent up until now,couldn&#39;t contain himself any longer. = &#34;Sir, the hotel is exceedingly secure. You have nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Nikolas turned out to be more of a headache than anyone anticipated. He turned his gaze back to Daniela, his expression firm. &#34;I&#39;d rather stay at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze squarely, her smile tinged with a hint of irony. &#34;You&#39;re welcome to stay at my villa,though you should know it was the site of an explosion. I do wonder if you&#39;d be bold enough to take that risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a derisive huff. &#34;Why would I be scared?It wasn&#39;t me who got blown up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile widened, her tone light yet laced with a subtle edge. &#34;Is that so? Well, it&#39;s hard to say, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sensed an underlying message in Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
