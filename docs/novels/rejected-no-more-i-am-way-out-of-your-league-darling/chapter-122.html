            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexander was seething with fury, feeling like he would explode at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his arrival at the bar, he found Keith swaying slightly, clearly drunk and unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander shared his grievances, Keith&#39;s eyes widened in astonishment, realizing the truth in his friend&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking it down for him, Keith remarked thoughtfully, &#34;Tell me if I&#39;m off base here, Alexander.Wasn&#39;t it Daniela who was always following you around? She used to hang on your every word while you barely gave her the time of day. Now,she&#39;s wealthy, and suddenly you&#39;re showing interest. No wonder she questions your motives. Daniela makes a good point,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw, his expression growing stormy as he gulped down his drink forcefully. &#34;So you&#39;re suggesting I play hard to get?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Cedric&#39;s tender ways with Daniela flashed through his mind. &#34;If I delay too long, she might settle down and start a family with Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just keep showing her kindness,&#34; Keith advised, his words slurring as the alcohol took over. &#34;People have hearts; they&#39;re not just emotionless stones. Be patient with her, whether it&#39;s for a year, two years,or even a decade. Alexander, your pride is getting in the way. You act as if everyone should adore you! Daniela has changed; what makes you think she&#39;ll return to you? You need to change your approach.Constantly expecting her to appease you will only drive her away. As a man, don&#39;t let pride dictate your actions,especially since she&#39;s your ex-wife. Why fuss about who&#39;s right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hearty slap on the back, Keith exclaimed,&#34;What a foolish man you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that,Keith crumpled to the floor in a heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched, making no move to assist him. He sat in his chair, ensnared by his own thoughts for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, his voice broke the silence, soft and uncertain. &#34;Is that really how it is? One year... two years... a decade? If I chase after her, will Daniela ever return to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux, embracing a modern approach,had implemented a balanced work week: four days of work followed by three days of rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, ever the efficient worker, had completed her assignments the previous evening. Her secretary popped in with a reminder, bubbling with enthusiasm. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t forget about the banquet tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression shadowed with a touch of melancholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary departed with an uncontainable grin.Throughout her tenure, she had never encountered a CEO as genuinely charming as Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adorned in her elegant evening gown, Daniela nINE ASKED,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>descended the stairs only to be greeted by the unexpected sight of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attire was impeccably tailored-a stark black suit that contrasted with his recent tan, acquired from his time on construction sites, lending him an air of rugged sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arrival at the venue, Daniela excused herself to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she made her way back, the crisp sound of her phone&#39;s notification caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Checking it, she discovered a message from Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyebrow arched high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Alexander had finally given up after their heated discussion last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a dry chuckle, her smirk carrying a sharp edge of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money had a miraculous way of bending principles. The man she once admired for his staunch principles was now humbling himself repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message simply stated, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk played on Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric spotted her, she was gazing at her phone, her dimples deepening enchantingly on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got you in such a good mood? You look exceptionally cheerful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her phone towards Cedric as they continued on their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexander stepped out of the restroom.He caught the sound of Daniela&#39;s laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her happiness that echoed in her laughter-happiness sparked by his message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter rang melodious, stirringa wave of elation in Alexander&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He now believed Keith&#39;s advice. If he persisted in showing genuine kindness to Daniela, she would undoubtedly feel his sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only a matter of time before everything Daniela had became his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished, with all his heart, that Daniela could go back to being the person she once was.</p>
