                <p>Elyse emerged from Natalie&#39;s place and immediately noticed Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she attempted to engage Nina, her efforts were met with indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, Elyse redirected her focus towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee had always been known for her gentleness. Elyse believed Daniela had inherited this trait, unlike Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared that Natalie might not prioritize her well-being in future events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to see her affluent niece, Daniela, as a more dependable ally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse purchased some pastries, removed the packaging, and entered Daniela&#39;s office with a cheerful demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made these pastries myself, Daniela. They&#39;re your favorite, and I stayed up all night baking them. Notice my dark circles? That shows how much you mean to me, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at the pastries and offered a warm smile. &#34;Thank you, Aunt Elyse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse reached to give one to Daniela, Cedric stepped in to intercept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s reducing her sugar intake, so she&#39;ll have to pass on these.&#34; He doubted the street-bought pastries were suitable for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Elyse watching, Cedric discarded the pastries into the bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s,smile wavered, her composed exterior almost breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silenced by Daniela&#39;s lack of response, Elyse could only comment bitterly,&#34;aniela, your husband really does assert himself. I&#39;m your aunt, and he feels the need to screen what I bring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a laugh, &#34;You know, I actually enjoy this side of him.&#34; After pausing for a momnent, Elyse pulled up a chair and sat down opposite Daniela. &#34;You remind me of your mother, always standing by your family. That&#39;s what I admire about you. There&#39;s something on my mind I&#39;ve hesitated to mention. Should I bring it up, or keep it to myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a gentle smile. &#34;Aunt Elyse, if you&#39;re unsure, perhaps it&#39;s best left unsaid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was stunned. Daniela&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t what she had anticipated. How was she to request favors if she remained silent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering her future, she realized she might need to prepare for her own retirement, particularly if she couldn&#39;t depend on Natalie or Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, then, I&#39;ll just say it.&#34; Elyse showed no shame. &#34;Here&#39;s the deal-before your mother passed,she agreed to cover my retirement. Now that she&#39;s gone...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, giving Daniela a meaningful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled and responded, &#34;Are you suggesting I should take over the support for your retirement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse forced a smile. &#34;I hesitated to mention it, but your mother was adamant. Now that she&#39;s no longer here,I believe we should respect her wishes. Your business is thriving, and surely the support won&#39;t strain your finances. You&#39;re going to give it to me, aren&#39;t you? After all, you&#39;re such a devoted &#39;niece, and it&#39;s hardly a significant amount for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela examined Elyse&#39;s calculating expression. &#34;Did my mother actually promise that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Elyse replied, growing anxious. She rummaged through her purse, pulled out an old mobile phone, and shoved it across the table, eager to play a recording. &#34;Listen, I recorded our conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was subdued. &#34;You made a recording?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was ridiculously outdated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting back, Elyse beamed. &#34;I recorded it just for fun, and now it serves a purpose. Without it, I&#39;d have no evidence since your mother is gone. How else could I claim justice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse spoke lightly of death, yet Daniela&#39;s expression darkened with each word. Unaware, Elyse was quite satisfied with her own foresight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm demeanor, Daniela asked, &#34;How could you have anticipated needing such proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Elyse&#39;s face stiffened suddenly. &#34;I recorded it just for fun. Didn&#39;t I mention that? Who could have predicted your mother&#39;s untimely departure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of anxiety struck Elyse; she realized her impulsiveness had cost her composure. Avoiding further discomfort,she divered her gaze downwards. &#34;Do your mother&#39;s words still hold weight with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse tried attempting confidence, but she caught the piercing look in Daniela&#39;s eyes and found herself retreating. &#34;Could you consider supporting me in my later years,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied Elyse&#39;s calculating expression and inquired evenly, &#34;In what way do you expect my support?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing an opportunity, Elyse perked up and straightened her posture. &#34;Daniela, your circumstances have changed, but believe me, I&#39;m not asking for much. I really don&#39;t need a lot.&#34;</p>
