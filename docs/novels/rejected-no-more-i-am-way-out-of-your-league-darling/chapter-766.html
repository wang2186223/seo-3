                <p>Nikolas stood in the surveillance room,a cold,sinister smile curling on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician stood beside him, visibly trembling, his fear palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, isn&#39;t it time? Fifteen minutes have passed since the elevator malfunctioned. The people inside can&#39;t reach anyone,and they must be in complete panic by now. Your brother is still trapped in there.If something happens, I won&#39;t be able to face your father. And your secretary is in there too, right? He&#39;s been loyal to you for years. You wouldn&#39;t want to hurt him,would you?Please,let me get them out of the elevator!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician&#39;s voice was trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything went wrong, five lives would be lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of responsibility was almost unbearable for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept his eyes on the surveillance screen,watching the minutes slipby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the monitor, there was no sign of movement in the elevator, aside from the faint glow from the initial  light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, whether from dead phones or the occupants losing consciousness from fear, the silence was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squinted, leaning in closer to inspect the figures inside the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monitor flickered, and the elevator was swallowed by a wave of suffocating darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician, panic-stricken, pleaded,&#34;They must have fainted by now. The air is running out. If we don&#39;t act fast, it&#39;ll be too late!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scrutinized the screen again, confirming that there was no movement inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to respond, Charles entered,having overheard Nikolas&#39; conversation with the technician. He was stunned, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon is in that elevator! We promised we wouldn&#39;t endanger family, no matter the situation.And Cedric&#39;s in there too. Aren&#39;t you worried Dad will hold you responsible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his fists, his patience slipping away.&#34;What do I have to be afraid of?&#34; Cedric is an illegitimate son. The McCoy family belongs to me.It always has and always will. Anyone who dares to stand in my way will pay the price. No one can stop me from claiming McCoy Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was taken aback, his eyes wide with shock.&#34;Are you insane? Damon is in that elevator right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s his own stupidity! I told him to get out, but he refused to listen. Don&#39;t put the blame on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stood frozen, utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined that Nikolas would one day betray them all for the sake of the fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization struck him like a punch to the gut,leaving him both shocked and sorrowful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he opened his mouth to speak, the technician shouted in panic, &#34;Oh no! The elevator is going to crash!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A terrible screeching sound of metal grinding echoed through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deafening,horrifying crash followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another loud, bone-jarring noise filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator crashed to the bottom floor with a violent thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise was so deafening that everyone in the surveillance room knew in their gut that the people in the elevator were doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sprang to his feet, his face alight with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician stood motionless for a moment,then crumpled to the floor, his voice barely a whisper. &#34;It&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles spun toward Nikolas, his voice trembling with disbelief. &#34;Damon is in there! How are you going to explain this to Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked,madness flashing in his eyes.&#34;Explain?This was an elevator accident. How can anyone blame me? What&#39;s it got to do with me? Damon chose to be in the same elevator as Daniela. How can you blame me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric were gone! Hamilton&#39;s attention was solely on the surviving four brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, being the eldest, knew that the McCoy family&#39;s heir could only be him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas burst into maniacal laughter, while Charles remained fixated on the dim surveillance feed.Outside,the blaring alarm pierced through the tense air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the alarm blended with frantic footsteps echoing through the halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles collapsed onto the sofa,his body heavy with defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Daniela truly gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was really dead, did that mean he was no longer in the running for heir?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair washed over Charles. He sat motionless for what felt like an eternity, before finally rising, his body trembling with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast a sorrowful glance at Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Nikolas had triumphed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Charles sank deeper into hopelessness, his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen and saw that it was a call from Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening with Nikolas? Why can&#39;tl reach him?Where are you? Get to my office now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles pressed his lips together, replying with a sense of defeat,&#34;I&#39;m with him.&#34;Hamilton hesitated for a moment before speaking again. &#34;Bring him with you then! This is a huge incident I&#39;ve been trying to reach everyone, but no one&#39;s answering. What have you been doing all day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call abruptly ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles conveyed Hamilton&#39;s message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they went upstairs, Nikolas said smugly to Charles, &#34;No matter what Dad had planned before,among the four of us, he favors me the most.I know you were hoping Daniela would help you turn things around. How laughable! I can already guess what you&#39;re thinking. Dad might blame me for this, but who cares? He&#39;ll still choose me as the heir. He won&#39;t hurt me, but as for you all.. You all used to say you supported me as heir, but you had your own schemes.I&#39;ll forgive you this time, but in the future,I expect you to follow my lead! Once I take control of McCoy Group,you&#39;ll all step down from your roles and enjoy the dividends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas spoke, the elevator doors slid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen and Duran overheard Nikolas&#39; scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of their eyes widened in disbelief</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never imagined the scene would turn so awkward when Nikolas revealed his true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator came to a stop at the CEO&#39;s office floor Nikolas shook his jacket, stepping out of the elevator first with a triumphant air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others followed, their heads bowed in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas strode toward Hamilton&#39;s office, pushing the door open with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already made up his mind about what he would say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would tell Hamilton that he would be the CEO of McCoy Group, regardless of his opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swung the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, he froze in shock.</p>
