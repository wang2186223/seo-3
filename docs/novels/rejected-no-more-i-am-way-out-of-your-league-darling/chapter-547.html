                <p>Nineteen long years had elapsed since the tragedy of Brylee&#39;s untimely demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This day had come too late. But fortunately, it had finally come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela accepted the puppy from the vet, before slipping into her car to head home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey trailed behind her every step of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance of the villa, Daniela paused on the stone steps. Her gaze, cold and piercing, landed on Huey, as if looking at a dead man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sent a shiver down Huey&#39;s spine. &#34;This is just the beginning. Why give up now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey,visibly shaken,raised his head to meet Daniela&#39;s steely eyes, which glittered menacingly under the moonlit sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome by a mix of fear and uncertainty, he remained kneeling outside the villa until the stroke of midnight. Gradually, the realization dawned on him that his waiting was in vain. Numbness crept into his knees, yet with a burst of resentful determination,he forced himself to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dawn painted the sky, Huey found himself at the commerce association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Bruno caught sight of him, a smirk curled his lips. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect to see you this early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s response was a silent, chilling glare that he directed towards Bruno, his eyes narrowing into slits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno grinned. &#34;Remember how you mocked me before? At least I managed to hold out for two days.What about you? A mere phone call was all it took for you to crumble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He vividly remembered the scorn in Huey&#39;s voice when he had desperately sought assistance,how Huey had derided him with a smug sneer plastered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By ten o&#39;clock that morning, everyone had convened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, having resigned himself to his fate, exuded an air of unusual calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, having presented his gift, appeared utterly disinterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow stretched languidly, curling up in a corner and shutting his eyes; the others couldn&#39;t tell if he was  actually sleeping or merely feigning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s fist came down hard on the table, his voice seething with rage. &#34;Daniela is venomous! If she dares,I want her to face me herself! She&#39;s behind all this,using underhanded tactics! She&#39;s stripped me of everything. Her greed knows no bounds! Hackett,you&#39;ve witnessed my ruin. If you remain passive, it won&#39;t just be our association that appears weak-your companies will be jeopardized as well. I may have been stripped of everything, but I refuse to let this go unanswered! You simply can&#39;t turn a blind eye to this Who&#39;s next on the list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension rippled through the group as they traded wary looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett scrunched his features in concentration,the pieces of the puzzle gnawing at his mind. &#34;What did you just say? She&#39;s behind all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey nodded. &#34;Daniela herself admitted it! She was playing dumb and outsmarting us all! We&#39;ve all been deceived by her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Hackett&#39;s face as the revelation sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was the mastermind behind it all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had given his gift to Cedric.  Hackett&#39;s heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow observed Hackett with a disinterested yet piercing gaze. He saw the sudden ashen look on Hackett&#39;s face,the stiffening of his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his gaze, Winslow said, &#34;Hackett, what&#39;s got you so rattled all of a sudden? Does it really make a difference whether the mastermind is Daniela or Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, all eyes turned to Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s heart thudded painfully against his ribs, yet he managed to drape a cloak of feigned outrage over his features. &#34;What exactly are you suggesting? I&#39;m utterly astonished at the depths of Daniela&#39;s cunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; gaze sharpened as he scrutinized Hackett, a flicker of suspicion crossing his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite lengthy discussions, the meeting concluded without any decisive outcomes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the goods from Huey&#39;s company, their best resolution was merely a promise to dispatch an investigator soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey departed, his steps heavy, the glaring sunlight outside intensifying his sense of defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, Hackett returned to Elite Lux,his hands filled with elaborately wrapped gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfectly timing his entrance with the lunch hour,he perched in the cafeteria, a practiced smile playing on his lips as he waited for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before sitting down with Cedric, Daniela said to Lillian.&#34;We must enhance our security measures. Tell Ryan to implement a faciaI recognition system at the entrance of the cafeteria. It&#39;s imperative that we restrict access to employees only.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian acknowledged with a quick nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smile briefly faltered as he addressed Daniela. &#34;I hope you don&#39;t mind my impromptu visit.Ms. Harper. Your fondness fo jade came to mind when I spotted some exquisite pieces at last night&#39;s auction. I couldn&#39;t resist getting them for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gingerly set a lavish gift box on the table, its price tag boldly indicating five hundred million-a testament to its value, accompanied by a gleaming certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,raising an eyebrow, responded with a mix of amusement and suspicion, &#34;This is incredibly generous of you. But are the others in the association aware of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In stark contrast to Cedric, Daniela exuded an icy aloofness, her polite detachment rendering her seemingly unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s heart fluttered anxiously in his chest, yet he managed to conjure up a strained smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he was gearing up to speak, Daniela dropped a casual bombshell. &#34;I&#39;ve heard about your three beautiful daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment sent a shiver down Hackett&#39;s spine, his forehead beading with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips twitched into a slight, enigmatic smile as she continued, &#34;My husband never tires of lauding your skills in nurturing such beautiful daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Hackett&#39;s mouth twitched, caught between a grimace and a smile. He was unsure if he was being praised or subtly ridiculed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to his smile, a bit too tightly, and bowed his head slightly, masking the surge of bitterness that threatened to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what brings you here today?&#34; Daniela probed, her voice light but with an undercurrent of scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a nervous chuckle, more of a stammer than a laugh. &#34;Considering you&#39;re at the helm of this acquisition, I just wanted to clear the air. Any past misunderstandings-I hope there are no hard feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him, her expression shifting to one  of perplexity. &#34;Why? There&#39;s nothing to clear. You seem to be overstating things. Weren&#39;t you the one who always preached that women should be seen as mere adornments for men, advising Cedric against pampering me too much? I must admit, sometimes your observations might hold a grain of truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her last words, coated with a sweet, sardonic smile,sent a fresh wave of anxiety crashing over Hackett,his complexion turning ashen as the implication of her words fully dawned on him.</p>
