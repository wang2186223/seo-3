                <p>Daniela always harbored a fondness for a specific type of liquor-filled chocolates, a rare find from abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would often marvel at their decadent taste and the unique flavor that set them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, Alexander had managed to acquire some. He asked the cleaning lady to deliver them to Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I just leave this box on the CEO&#39;s desk? Just chocolates, nothing more, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander offered a confident nod. &#34;Absolutely. I hold your CEO in high esteem, and I&#39;m aware she appreciates these chocolates. Would you mind handing them to her?&#34; He handed the cleaning lady one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaning lady accepted the chocolates and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as she was tidying up the office, she placed the box on Daniela&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, just out of a meeting, noticed the sophisticated packaging of the chocolates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to chase after this exact brand whenever she got the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her eyes lighting up as she saw the cleaning lady smiling broadly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, a relative of mine brought these back from overseas. Recalling your fondness for them, I thought to bring you a box. Try them, see if they rekindle those cherished flavors you adored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, they were Daniela&#39;s most cherished flavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she wanted to, she knew she couldn&#39;t indulge in them now that she was expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, these are precisely the type I relish. I generally enjoy them after dinner. Thanks for the thoughtful gift.&#34; The cleaning lady offered a smile in return before she resumed her duties, pushing her cort do hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Lillian entered the room briskly, her eyes lighting up at the sight of the chocolates. Without a second thought, she snatched one and tossed it into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, aren&#39;t you supposed to avoid these right now? What prompted this indulgence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engrossed in a mound ofdocuments, Daniela responded without looking up,&#34;Oh, they were a kind offering from the cleaning lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cleaning lady?&#34; Lillian paused, eyebrows knitting together in surprise. &#34;When did she start gifting chocolates as opulent as these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, her pen hovering above the paper. She lifted her eyes to meet Lillian&#39;s, a trace of confusion flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This box costs what she earns in a year. Could she afford something so extravagant?&#34; Lillian probed further,her voice laced with skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a gift from one of her relatives,&#34; Daniela clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian cocked her head, her skepticism deepening. &#34;What sort of relative would distribute gifts this generous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctant to cast aspersions, Daniela&#39;s expression grew thoughtful, mirroring Lillian&#39;s concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dive into it. Verify whether this relative truly gifted her the chocolates. If so, arrange for the expense to be transferred to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian acknowledged with a nod and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she paused at the doorway, turning to add, &#34;If someone else passed them to her, then the rumors of your pregnancy might be circulating. Be cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After departing from Daniela&#39;s office, the cleaning lady made her way across the street from the opulent Elito Lunc huildina There, obscured by a mask, was Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has she consumed them?&#34; he inquired curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, she mentioned they were her favorite flavor. She expressed her gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently,Alexander handed her an additional one hundred thousand dollars and departed without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile, the cleaning lady secured the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had planned to enjoy the chocolates after dinner, which made the cleaning lady believe her claim of them being consumed wasn&#39;t entirely deceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned to her duties with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sat in his car, his gaze detached and frosty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was deeply unsettled. The thought of Daniela bearing Cedric&#39;s child troubled him deeply. If that happened, she would never be able to part ways with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Daniela well. Plagued by an unstable childhood, she was desperate for a steady life. The prospect of a child would cement her to Cedric forever, regardless of her dwindling affections. She&#39;d endure any discomfort to forge the stable family unit she had always yearned for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And where did that place him in her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to move fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander located Hackett, who was visibly seething with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, do you even realize the audacity of your actions? You&#39;ve managed to exile me from the association! Did you forget how eagerly you groveled at my feet for an opportunity when you first started?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze was piercing and steadfast. &#34;I played no part in your expulsion. The others lost faith in you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, if you can devise a strategy that benefits the association, perhaps they&#39;ll reconsider your expulsion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett barked a scornful laugh. &#34;You, of all people, offering me assistance? How absurd.&#34; Unperturbed, Alexander reclined slightly, his expression composed. &#34;Hackett, If&#39;s clear you&#39;re keen on undermining Daniela. Have you discovered her vulnerability yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smirk morphed into á grimace of contempt. &#34;Daniela? Even with her fortunes, she&#39;s vulnerable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone has a vulnerability,&#34; Alexander countered, his tone cold and deliberate.</p>
