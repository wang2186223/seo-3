                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light of the underground parking lot, his expression was unreadable, like a mask that gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips together, and sensing the tension, she quietly asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric locked eyes with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many things he wanted to ask, so many questions that swirled in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he looked into her clear eyes and heard her cool, almost distant tone, he found himself unable to voice any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, after a moment of silence, he spoke with determination.&#34;|fyou&#39;re moving back to your father&#39;s place, I&#39;m coming with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had anticipated Cedric would ask something. But his declaration left her momentarily stunned.&#34;What? Why?&#34; she questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already told you, I&#39;m courting you. It was difficult enough living on separate floors at Elite Lux. If you move to your father&#39;s, it&#39;ll only make it harder for me to find reasons to be around you. So, you can go, but I&#39;m coming with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left his mouth, Cedric realized how unlikely his request sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied him for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to respond, footsteps echoed across the concrete. Upon recognizing the figure, her expression hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Alexander. Alexander stode forward quickly, his irritation clear as he feached out to grab Dáníela&#39;s afm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped forward, placing himself between them and blocking Alexander&#39;s path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stopped abruptly, his gaze lifting to meet Cedric&#39;s. The two men stared at each other in silence for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l just need to ask Daniela a few things. Would you mind?&#34; Alexander said, his tone controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood firm, hands in his pockets, his posture radiating defiance. &#34;I&#39;m not stopping you from speaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind Cedric, Daniela noticed for the first time just how tall he truly was. Being so close, she caught a subtle whiff of his cologne-cool and crisp. It was a stark contrast to his earlier blunt, almost aggressive demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up, noting the broadness of his shoulders. For the first time, she thought of Cedric as a reassuring presence, someone who could actually make her feel safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say what you need to, or leave,&#34; Cedric said to Alexander, his voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned against the car, silent and seemingly uninterested in getting involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander immediately picked up on how unusual Daniela&#39;s reaction was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been distant and fiercely independent. She preferred to handle her own matters. But now,she was letting Cedric send him away without even speaking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared calm, her lips curled into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the woman he remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization made Alexander uneasy. He moved to the side,reaching again for Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pushed Alexander&#39;s arm aside, enough to make it sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander could feel the tense energy radiating from Cedric, the sudden coldness in his manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized that if he kept challenging Cedric, he might end up like Katrina in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I just want to talk. You don&#39;t have to treat me like I&#39;ma criminal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Cedric&#39;s growing tension, Daniela gently pulled at his sleeve. &#34;Stay here with me. Right by my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been glaring at Alexander, softened instantly. He nodded and stepped to stand beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead,&#34; Daniela said, straightening up as her smile vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes darted between her and Cedric, confused by Daniela&#39;s sudden change in behavior.&#34;You really think I&#39;m that dangerous? I won&#39;t hurt you. You can&#39;t even talk to me in private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of his behavior was for her benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had pursued her, only to end up humiliated like this?①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced at Daniela, his eyes revealing the hurt he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have something to say, say it now. Otherwise, I&#39;m leaving,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed his lips together. &#34;So, this is some kind of game, huh? You&#39;re showing off this cozy act with Cedric in front of me, hoping it&#39;ll stir some jealousy or anger. You think it&#39;ll make me reconsider pursuing you? Here&#39;s the truth-you&#39;re completely missing the point. This kind of behavior won&#39;t bring me closer to you; in fact, it&#39;s doing the opposite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As always, he was confident that, no matter what, Daniela still wanted him deep down. He believed her seeming closeness with Cedric was merely to provoke him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he had tolerated her behavior, but now he admitted he could no longer ignore the growing irritation in his heart. So, he stated it plainly. He could no longer play this game of hard-to-get</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela squinted, almost laughing at how absurd it all seemed. She gave him a thumbs-up in response to his cold stare. &#34;It&#39;s a real shame you&#39;re not writing novels with that kind of imagination.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes, displeased. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; &#34;You said I don&#39;t understand men. Do you understand women? I can&#39;t speak for other women, buf as for me...&#34; Daniela looked at him, her eyes now empty of the passion they once held for Alexander. That passion had been replaced by cold indifference. &#34;Once I make up my mind to leave, I never look back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took pride in her straightforwardness. When she liked someone, she made it clear. And when she didn&#39;t, she simply walked away. She couldn&#39;t understand where Alexander&#39;s delusion had come from.)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, taken aback by her response. For a moment, Daniela&#39;s words felt like a sharp stab to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked eyes with her, noticing the seriousness that lingered in her gaze. Panic crept in, a strange feeling that he wasn&#39;t used to, but one he knew he didn&#39;t welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against his own instincts, he couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;You&#39;re really going to act like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Daniela let out a genuine laugh, her smile dripping with sarcasm.&#34;D。you really have to keep acting like this? Alexander, I&#39;ve completely lost patience with your nonsense.&#34;</p>
