                <p>Hamilton flinched and shot a glare at the door. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing here? Be quiet. You startled my grandson. I won&#39;t let this slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason slammed the sealed jasmine onto the table.The bang echoed around the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared Hamilton down. &#34;So sure about that grandson? He might never draw a breath. Your grandson? What a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face turned red with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason struck the table again. &#34;Daniela, you cruel ·woman.How dare you poison my father. You really do have the nerve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted an eyebrow, slouching back in her chair.&#34;Looks like that poisonous jasmine did its job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason jabbed a finger at her. &#34;You admit it? You dare say it out loud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a short scoff. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I?I&#39;ve always been honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s fury tangled his tongue. He turned to Hamilton. &#34;Did you hear her? She confessed.She tried to kill my father with that cursed plant. He&#39;s still lying in a hospital bed, fresh out of surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze, stunned. He was ready to snap at Daniela when his eyes landed on the jasmine on the table. His brow creased tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up slowly and asked Mason, &#34;This looks too familiar. There were many jasmines outside Daniela&#39;s villa. Were they all poisonous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice dropped to a chilling low,each word sharp enough to cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver crawled over him. Back then, when the gardener said they were good for the baby, he had told the gardener to plant as many plants as possible outside Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric hadn&#39;t blocked her from those flowers, she might have already lost the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason had stood by, waiting for Hamilton to lash out at Daniela. Instead, Hamilton fixed his eyes on Mason.&#34;So your father planted poisonous jasmines outside Daniela&#39;s home? I always thought Brad, Jules, and Ethan were snakes sending garbage to her doorstep,but I figured your father was decent. Looks like I was blind. He is the most vicious man among you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason had come to argue but faltered under the blame. He let out an awkward cough. &#34;She poisoned my father too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol folded her arms and scoffed from the side.&#34;Really? You people planted countless toxic flowers outside our villa. We only placed one flower in your house.If your father got sick, that&#39;s karma at work. We only meant to knock him out, not kill him. But he tried to murder Daniela and her baby. So tell me, who&#39;s worse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, tired of the back and forth, flicked a paper onto the table. &#34;Enough chatter. Pay for cleaning the jasmines and clearing the air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason squinted at the amount. &#34;A million? Daniela,are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed lightly. &#34;Of course I am. Pay it now,or I&#39;ll let you sniff the poison up close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason scowled but forked over the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on his heel, ready to spit out one last insult,but Hamilton lunged after him, roaring so loud the windows trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rat! Tell your father we are at war nowN. Touch Daniela&#39;s child, and I&#39;ll rip you apart myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s rage burned his face red. The veins in his neck pulsed like ropes about to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned back with a grin, shooting Daniela a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton might not win father of the year, but he sure does know how to guard his grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol figured if Josh showed up now, Hamilton might just strangle himn dead on the spot.</p>
