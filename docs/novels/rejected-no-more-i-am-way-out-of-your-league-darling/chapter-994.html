                <p>Brad and Ethan clung to their hopes, eyes glued to their screens, willing the numbers to bounce back into their accounts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality, however, was a gut punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stormed over to Cedric, waving his phone. &#34;What happened to my money? Everybody else already got paid back, so why are we still out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan hovered nearby, his gaze pleading, silently echoing Brad&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unhurried, undid his cufflinks and slipped into a pair of slippers. &#34;Don&#39;t look at me. I don&#39;t have your money, and I&#39;m not about to shoulder the blame for someone else&#39;s mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad froze in disbelief. &#34;Then where did it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sauntered toward the kitchen, voice drifting lazily over his shoulder. &#34;Haven&#39;t you figured it out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the truth click for Brad-Jules had taken their money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan bolted out the door and tore off toward Jules&#39; home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Jules reclined on a lounge chair, savoring an imported cigar while a dazzling fleet of limited-edition cars gleamed in the sunlight behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his brothers stormed up the drive, Jules lifted his gaze and flashed a leisurely grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looking for your money? Go ask Josh for it. Everything I have here... I earned it with quick thinking and smart tactics, not by waiting around.&#34;	1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad scowled, refusing to buy it.&#34;Cut the crap, Jules. That money belonged to us, and you know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, Brad and Ethan stormed toward the garage, fists clenched and ready to wreck the lineup of limited-edition cars. Jules snapped, &#34;I know who orchestrated the explosion all those years ago. That&#39;s why Daniela paid me off.And the money is her way of saying thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brad and Ethan finally cornered Daniela, she faced them with effortless poise. &#34;Yes. Anyone who brings me useful information gets paid. That&#39;s how I run things-fair and square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad bristled with frustration. &#34;But...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s voice shook as he pressed the question. &#34;Why paying with our money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, her eyes steely and unbothered. &#34;The McCoy family made their bed, now they must lie in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavily pregnant, Daniela had grown drowsy most afternoons. Even with Cedric buried in work, he made it a point to be by her side whenever she needed rest, slipping away from meetings just to keep her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela&#39;s eyelids fluttering, Cedric spoke up, cutting through the tension. &#34;If you want your money,talk to Josh. He&#39;s the one you should be chasing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw tight with frustration, Brad threw a glare Daniela&#39;s way. &#34;You could have warned us. This was your setup -if you wanted the money from Josh, why drag the rest of us down too? We&#39;ve paid for a crime we didn&#39;t commit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who seconds ago seemed half-asleep, suddenly looked wide awake at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lounged back on the sofa with a faint, mocking smile, eyelids half-lowered in feigned indolence. &#34;You really believe you&#39;re blameless in all this? Who do you think masterminded that explosion? None of you are that naive. Since you&#39;re all so eager to feign ignorance, let&#39;s lay the truth bare. Jules saw everything-he caught Josh threatening your father, vowing to get rid of my child. Your father berated him, but deep down,he didn&#39;t trust Josh to finish the job. He also couldn&#39;t risk my child being his first great-grandson-robbing Josh&#39;s line of its rightful glory. So, he took matters into his own hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned razor-sharp. &#34;Back then, Mason&#39;s lover was pregnant. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve forgotten.Everyone assumed she&#39;d have a boy. In the end, your father&#39;s fear that I&#39;d snatch away the honor meant for Josh&#39;s line led him to plan the explosion himself. He did that for Josh and the McCoy family.He was worried I&#39;d overshadow the entire McCoy family, so he bribed my housekeeper and plotted that explosion. He didn&#39;t just want me gone. He wanted Cedric dead. And most of all, he was determined to kill the child I was carrying. Your father&#39;s gone now, but since all his schemes were for your sake, none of you get to walk away clean. And there is my mother&#39;s death. Now it&#39;s time to settle the score with the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela ripped away the last shred of civility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leveled a chilling look at Brad and Ethan, who stood across from her, pale-faced but hardly shocked,and let out a derisive laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Daniela strode to te foot of the staircase, catching sight of Hamilton clutching the railing,his hands trembling and his body barely holding together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him, Daniela found herself torn between contempt and a fleeting sense of pity for the pathetic man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had always cherished children and harbored a quiet guilt toward Cedric. Yet, bound by the McCoy family&#39;s name, he&#39;d forced himself to swallow every indignity and grievance the family had dealt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he&#39;d long suspected who had orchestrated those past events. But his father had made silence a necessity. So he had buried his pride and endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched him for a moment, then spoke with unexpected gentleness.&#34;Let me give you the fairness the McCoy family never granted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit him like a thunderclap. Hamilton&#39;s trembling grew violent, shoulders quaking as if battered by a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dam inside him broke, unleashing a torrent of emotions he&#39;d guarded for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela, a single tear tracing down his weathered cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was what the McCoy family owed him and his unborn grandchild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justice had finally arrived, achingly late, but at last, it was here.</p>
