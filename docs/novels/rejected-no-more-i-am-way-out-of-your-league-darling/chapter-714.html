                <p>Daniela glanced at Nikolas, noting the storm clouds gathering in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked uncomfortable, but for once, Daniela didn&#39;t tease him like she usually did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she casually gestured toward the dishes in front of them. &#34;If you&#39;re out of words, let&#39;s just eat in peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food Daniela chose was surprisingly good. Even with anger simmering inside him, Nikolas found himself eating heartily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol, why are you just eating lobster?&#34; Richard asked, puzzled. He noticed Carol sticking to lobster, Cedric focusing only on the fish, and Daniela not eaten anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shrugged. &#34;I&#39;ve just been into lobster lately. You eat what you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint sense of unease crept into Richard&#39;s gut. He turned to Cedric. &#34;You&#39;re only having the fish too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, ever composed, replied with a graceful smile, &#34;Not really. But tonight, the fish is especially good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he picked up a tender piece and held it out to Daniela. &#34;This one&#39;s light on bones. You should try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing and quietly took a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas could only sit there, seething. Seriously? Did they really have to flaunt their lovey-dovey nonsense now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;d known this dinner would be such torture, he would&#39;ve stayed home. Why had he come just to stew in his own frustration?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was so lost in his irritation that he kept shoveling food into his mouth, completely oblivious to the darkening look on Richard&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Richard bolted for the restroom that Nikolas felt something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell did you put in the food?&#34; Nikolas shot Daniela a sharp, accusatory glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even as the words left his mouth, doubt crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t left the room. She&#39;d ordered everything right in front of Richard. That was why they&#39;d all felt safe diving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There hadn&#39;t been any chance for them to tamper with the dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Nikolas could process anything else, a sharp pain sliced through his gut. He shot to his feet and bolted to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was already slumped inside, completely drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas doubled over too, barely able to stay on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas!&#34; The private room door burst open, and Kohen&#39;s voice rang out.&#34;Are you done yet? I&#39;ve called someone to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen froze in place, caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met Daniela&#39;s in a moment of silent tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thick, uncomfortable silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen gave a light chuckle, assuming Nikolas was just dawdling. &#34;Daniela, we&#39;re here to join you for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed composed, gesturing casually toward the empty seats. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter arrived promptly, placing tableware before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, slumped inside the restroom, could only hear Daniela&#39;s serene voice filtering in. &#34;Eat whatever you like Hesitant, Kohen picked up his fork, eyeing the dishes warily. &#34;Where&#39;s my brother?&#34; he asked with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered smoothly, &#34;He stepped out to take a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen gave a slow nod,half-convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Daniela added casually, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you were here to eat? Don&#39;t be shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen blinked, momentarily stunned by her calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Charles looked caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no better option, Kohen glanced at the half-eaten dishes, trying to guess which ones were safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas mustered his remaining strength and slammed his fist weakly against the restroom door,desperate to warn Kohen and Charles about the tainted food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one heard a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; effort was as useless as tossing a pillow at the door-no sound, no reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen had always liked the food here, but something felt off. Playing it safe, he used the excuse of wanting variety and ordered a few fresh dishes for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside, Nikolas heard Kohen placing the order and felt a small wave of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next moment, everything went black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had nothing left to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s my brother taking so long?&#34; Kohen muttered between bites, subtly watching the others&#39; faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one looked like they&#39;d been hit with a heavy dose of laxative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile. &#34;Maybe something came up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles turned to Carol. &#34;You&#39;ve got great taste, Carol. The lobster is seriously amazing!&#34;But the moment he said it, both he and Kohen froze, their expressions twisting in sudden alarm.</p>
