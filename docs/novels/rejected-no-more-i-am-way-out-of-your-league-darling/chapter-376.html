                <p>Elyse shut down Nina&#39;s pleas without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Nina was trapped in a delusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Cedric could ever have feelings for Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Cedric truly been interested,even a little, he wouldn&#39;t have let the chance slip by yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that Cedric hadn&#39;t even touched Nina spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to tell Daniela today that you&#39;re returning to Harper Group to help me,Elyse instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina cried out, her voice trembling with desperation.&#34;No! Please,give me another chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse gave Nina a frosty look before turning her attention back to the television. &#34;I&#39;ve already told you,Cedric doesn&#39;t like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Nina rose, her face bathed in the ghostly glow of the TV screen. &#34;Is it that Cedric doesn&#39;t like me, or are you just scared he might?&#34; Elyse snapped back, &#34;What nonsense are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s not true, then why are you pushing me back to Harper Group? Is it because my sister is coming back?You&#39;re trying to make room for her, aren&#39;t you? As soon as I leave, you&#39;ll have Daniela bring Natalie into Elite Lux, right? Why is it always like this? Why do you favor her over me? Natalie likes Cedric, and so do 1.1won&#39;t give up! Cedric didn&#39;t make a move last night because he&#39;s not like other men you can judge by ordinary standards. He respects me enough to hold back. He didn&#39;t want to do anything while I wasn&#39;t fully sober.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice took on a more assured tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse laughed derisively in response. &#34;You&#39;re just dreaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving Elite Lux or Cedric. This time, I&#39;m fighting for my own happiness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse turned her head slowly to look at Nina. She had never anticipated her typically obedient daughter would challenge her so openly. &#34;Do you know where Cedric went after dropping you off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina looked taken aback. &#34;Where did he go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He packed his bags and left the country. If he truly cared about you, would he really be avoiding you like  this? Nina, you&#39;ve already embarrassed yourself enough in front of Daniela. How am I supposed to get anything from her now? I don&#39;t care what you have planned, but today, you&#39;re going to tell Daniela you want to go back to Harper Group. Refuse, and I&#39;ll cut off your financial support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in her office, still reflecting on Cedric&#39;s strange behavior when Nina knocked and entered. Her eyes were swollen and puffy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Nina choked out, tears streaming down her face, her appearance pitiful. &#34;My mom says I&#39;m useless at Elite Lux and wants me to go back to Harper Group. But I really enjoy working for you,Daniela. I&#39;d do anything to stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood at the doorway, intending to escort Nina back to Harper Group. Instead, she overheard Nina&#39;s pleading, and her expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom threatened to freeze my card if I didn&#39;t listen. Please, talk to her for me. I promise I&#39;ll follow your instructions. Just say a few kind words for me.I swear I&#39;ll behave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had an uncanny ability to appear pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her tears falling made anyone nearby want to offer comfort.</p>
