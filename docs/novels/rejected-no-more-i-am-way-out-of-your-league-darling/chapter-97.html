                <p>After Peyton&#39;s visit to Daniela&#39;s company, she had become utterly insufferable. She couldn&#39;t go a minute without bragging about her &#34;most accomplished granddaughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At every meal, without fail, she would point to a dish on the table and announce to everyone, &#34;This is Daniela&#39;s favorite. You should all have more of it-maybe it&#39;ll make you as clever as she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina forced herself to swallow both her food and the simmering rage building inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina!&#34; Peyton suddenly slammed her fork down onto the table, her sharp eyes locking onto her. &#34;Have you lost all sense of manners? What&#39;s with that expression? I&#39;m still here, aren&#39;t I? Or do you think you&#39;re the one in charge now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Peyton shifted her gaze to Joyce, who was sitting at the head of the table. &#34;And you-sitting at the main seat in front of us all? Like mother, like daughter! We gave you a roof over your head and even let Caiden, that clueless fool, marry your mother.If it weren&#39;t for us, what kind of life would you have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare you push my true granddaughter out of this house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the housekeeper, she barked, &#34;Daniela&#39;s room used to be in the center. Whatever it takes, that room needs to be restored by tomorrow. The best room in this house belongs to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to keep quiet, Katrina shot back, &#34;Absolutely not! That room has the best sunlight, the warmest and brightest spot in the house. Daniela&#39;s current room is cold and drafty at night. Joyce can&#39;t even stand it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton slapped her hand on the table and stood up,her eyes flashing with fury. &#34;So, the best room should go to your child? What about Daniela, my true granddaughter? Is she supposed to live in some filthy room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly protested, &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she leaned into Caiden&#39;s arms,tears falling. &#34;I know your mother has always seen me as less because I haven&#39;t had a child with your blood.I can accept that, but why bring Joyce into it? If I&#39;m such a failure, maybe I should just disappear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Katrina cry, Joyce&#39;s eyes welled with tears,and she began to sob too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let it go. Mom&#39;s getting old. Don&#39;t argue with her,&#34; Caiden muttered in his usual indifferent way. Katrina had heard this excuse so often that it grated on her nerves. Just as she was about to lose it, a servant entered and announced, &#34;Alexander is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Katrina heard the name, her eyes lit up with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, she&#39;d felt anxious. Richard hadn&#39;t returned her calls, and she feared things were getting out of hand. But with Alexander standing there before her,her hope surged. &#34;What a surprise, Alexander! What brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wrapped the sketchbook in a black plastic bag and handed it to Katrina. &#34;I borrowed this from Joyce a few days ago. It was taken from Daniela&#39;s room. Can you return it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina beamed,eager to do Alexander a favor.course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered inviting Alexander in for a meal,hoping to give him and Joyce a chance to connect.But the memory of Peyton&#39;s scowl held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander was about to leave, he couldn&#39;t help but glance over his shoulder. His eyes landed on Katrina,who tossed the bag into the trash can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bag hit the bottom with a loud clang, and just like that, the trash can was full to the top. She then called over to a servant. &#34;Replace the garbage bag and take it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant quickly crouched to change the bag as the door clicked shut behind Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking in the scene, he walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the sketchbook had done its job and was now nothing more than a burden. Since Daniela still harbored feelings for him, keeping it around seemed pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let Daniela still hold feelings for another man-even if that man was nothing more than a memory,a boy from the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela was going to have a future with him, she had to sever all tieswith her past. It wouldn&#39;t be hard-after all, they were just a few childish sketches,worth nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he thought about Richard&#39;s plan to have Daniela over for dinner in a few days, a slow smile tugged at the corners of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anticipation stirred within him-something he didn&#39;t often allow himself to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela might not have the most exciting personality,but there was no denying her beauty. If she could  settle down and be the kind of wife and mother he envisioned,he thought their marriage might just work after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, Alexander pushed the gas pedal, and his car shot off down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Peyton waited for the doors to shut completely before looking at Caiden. &#34;Was that Alexander just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained silent, but Ronald, always ready to cause a stir, spoke up. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s Alexander.The one who married Daniela and then divorced her. And if I&#39;m right...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for effect, then grinned as he continued,&#34;It&#39;s all because of Joyce, isn&#39;t it? She made a scene at their wedding and ruined a perfectly good marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt nodded eagerly, jumping into the conversation.&#34;Oh, that was all over the news. Mom, I still have the video of the fire on my phone. Your precious granddaughter nearly died in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone, found the video, and passed it to Peyton.</p>
