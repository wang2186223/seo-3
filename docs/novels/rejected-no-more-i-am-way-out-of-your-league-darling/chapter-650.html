                <p>Tasha was surprised to see that both Joyce and Caiden became well-behaved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jack? He was utterly fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned the living room into his personal playground,dashing around and purposefully obstructing Daniela&#39;s view of the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chuckled smugly from the sidelines, fully aware that no matter how strict Daniela could be, she wouldn&#39;t lay a finger on the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After suffering the loss of her own child, Daniela had a soft spot for kids, her patience stretching far beyond reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce saw an opportunity in that weakness, shaping Jack into the untouchable little troublemaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all started with defying Daniela-Joyce&#39;s ultimate plan was for Jack to slowly establish himself as the true ruler of the household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden in the dim light, Joyce flashed Jack a discreet thumbs-up. Jack caught sight of her approval and grinned mischievously before upping the stakes-climbing onto the sofa,shoes and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha&#39;s gaze flickered to Daniela. Even in their brief time together, she had noticed Daniela&#39;s obsession with cleanliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite Jack&#39;s antics, Daniela remained still,making no move to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha mused, &#34;That figures. Mothers always have a tender spot for children, reluctant to be too stern with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if kids weren&#39;t corrected early, they&#39;d grow impossible to handle later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Tasha concluded that Daniela was still too young, too unseasoned in such matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could dwell on it, the living room lights flickered and dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heartbeat later, the entire room was swNallowed by darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce spotted Jack&#39;s little stunt and let out a satisfied laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha exhaled,ready to switch the lights back on until she noticed Daniela rising slowly from the sofa. The TV remained the sole source of light, its flickering glowv dancing eerie shadows across the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha watched as Daniela caught Jack&#39;s wrist, her eyes dark and unreadable. &#34;Do you have a death wish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hand lifted. For a split second, everyone braced for the blow, but instead, a sharp bang shattered the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm crashed down-not on Jack, but against the glass table before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gawked in stunned silence, his face rigid as the flickering light cast eerie shadows over Daniela&#39;s emotionless features, making her seem even more chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let go of his collar, and as if on cue, the lights flooded the room with brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela strode past Jack, her steps slow and deliberate as she climbed the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen,still processing the moment when a sharp sound shattered the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass table exploded into shards, its fragments scattering across the floor with a sharp, nerve-rattling crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hushed stillness of the night, the sound carried an eerie, almost foreboding weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s fear finally broke through-he crumbled,bursting into tears right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha turned her head to where Daniela had disappeared, a thought pressing at the back of her mind. &#34;Daniela is truly a force to be reckoned with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, as Daniela descended the stairs,she found Jack quietly tinkering with his toys on the living room floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Daniela, he stole a wary glance at her,hesitation flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze briefly before heading to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some hesitation, Jack shuffled towards Daniela,his voice small as he mumbled, &#34;Auntie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wild defiance of yesterday had given way to careful effort today-clearly,someone had coached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to call me that if you don&#39;t want to.&#34;Daniela took a sip of her milk, her tone indifferent.&#34;You don&#39;t like me, so don&#39;t force it. Titles like &#39;Auntie&#39;mean nothing. If it bothers you, just use my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack studied Daniela carefully Daniela met his gaze. &#34;My name is Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack hesitated, then said, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seem the least bit angry. Jack exhaled in quiet relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed Jack steadily. &#34;This house belonged to my mother. You&#39;re welcome to stay, but I don&#39;t tolerate noise-like what you pulled yesterday. And certainly don&#39;t allow shoes on the sofa. If you keep it up, I&#39;ll have no choice but to ask you and your mom to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack frowned slightly. &#34;But my mom lets me do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed. &#34;When you&#39;re at your mother&#39;s house, follow her rules. But here? This is my house,and my rules stand. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack hesitated, then gave a small nod.&#34;Will you send me to an elite private school?&#34; he asked, eyes expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Jack blurted out, frustration creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I don&#39;t have to,&#34; Daniela replied, her tone level, devoid of condescension. &#34;I have no obligation to send you to an elite school. You&#39;re not my child,  and we&#39;re not even truly related.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack didn&#39;t fully grasp her words, but he did recall what his mother had told him. &#34;But my mom says if you don&#39;t treat me well, no one will look after you when you&#39;re old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow at his remark.Joyce really filled this kid&#39;s head with everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? If I ever need a child, I could always adopt one -one who&#39;s more obedient, smarter, and much quieter than you. I have plenty of money, but I don&#39;t owe you a single cent, and trust me, you won&#39;t be getting any of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack didn&#39;t quite follow but echoed, &#34;Then I won&#39;t take care of you when you&#39;re old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, unfazed. &#34;That&#39;s fine. You don&#39;t have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack frowned,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as he knew, refusing to care for Daniela in her &#39;old age should have been a serious threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what his mother had made him believe. Yet,Daniela didn&#39;t seem to care in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had she dismissed him so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if his presence in her life meant absolutely nothing. Did he not matter to Daniela at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions swirled in Jack&#39;s mind, but one thing became clear-he couldn&#39;t afford to push Daniela too far. Otherwise, he might end up like that poor glass table from yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack stole a look at Daniela. She was fierce,no doubt,yet strangely, he didn&#39;t feel scared of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stepped out into the garden for a stroll,he trailed behind her like a quiet little shadow.</p>
