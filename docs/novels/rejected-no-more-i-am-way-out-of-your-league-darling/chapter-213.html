                <p>As Joyce stepped onto the scene, she spotted Caiden already there, awaiting her arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided her across the street to a vantage point opposite a lavish restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering through the glass, Joyce caught sight of Richard fawning over Marlin, while Alexander maintained a facade of courteous subservience nearby, his smile strained yet polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the fragile fabric of Joyce&#39;s romantic fantasies tore apart, leaving her confronted with a stark reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thought consumed her entirely: she had to become Alexander&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her seeming defeat to Daniela in many aspects, in the matter of Alexander, Joyce had triumphed decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even compelled him to divorce Daniela, a victory that she considered the pinnacle of her life&#39;s narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True,she was born out of wedlock, a simple girl from the countryside, often the subject of scorn whispered by the elite women of high society. Yet, what did their derision matter when she had bested their paragon,Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This triumph alone could fuel her pride for a lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, the mere thought of Alexander returning to Daniela sparked a fierce jealousy and resolve within Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood on the bustling street, her fists clenched and eyes alight with a fierce determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, lingering nearby, silently watched her reaction unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Joyce&#39;s look of displeasure and reluctance stirred memories of a younger Katrina in him. Back in those days, Katrina had been plagued by the fear that his affections might drift towards Brylee.And then, tragedy struck-Brylee passed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rested his hand on Joyce&#39;s shoulder, his tone dripping with feigned concern. &#34;Everything I do,I do for your benefit. Trust me, I want your happiness even more than your mother does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was already aware that Huntley Lambert, the young heir of the Lambert family, was due to meet Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,when Huntley made his appearance at Harper Group, Cedric was there to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you&#39;re absolutely ridiculous. I&#39;ve just arrived, and here you are, blocking my path,&#34; Huntley remarked, a playful smirk on his face as he crossed his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze sharpened, his voice laced with impatience. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you back home looking after your family&#39;s affairs? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relationship between Cedric and Huntley stretched back over ten years, both as classmates and close friends. Now, seeing Cedric lose his usual calm demeanor only served to increase Huntley&#39;s enjoyment of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? Is it that you can chase after Daniela, but no one else is allowed to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not her type,&#34; Cedric stated, his voice laced with a chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley sneered, &#34;Oh, come on. I&#39;ve heard she&#39;s not too picky. After all, she fell for a guy like Alexander-the ultimate piece of trash. And how could she resist a charming prince like myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter erupted from Huntley as he watched Cedric&#39;s stern face twist in annoyance. His boisterous laughter filled the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a delightful scene it was!	J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout their enduring friendship, Huntley had never seen Cedric so visibly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s naturally reserved, but she&#39;s earnest and respectful with everyone. Your usual antics won&#39;t work on her,&#34; Cedric warned as they stepped into the elevator together. You think so?&#34; Huntley replied, shrugging nonchalantly. &#34;Perhaps she&#39;ll find my antics appealing.Besides,you haven&#39;t won her over yet, have you? If your approach isn&#39;t working, why not let me try? At the end of the day, we&#39;re friends. If one of us gets her, it&#39;s like we both win, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he flashed a confident grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained stoic, not a hint of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always the showman, Huntley had breezed through life with his charismatic, laid-back attitude. A self-proclaimed slacker, he had managed to sail through their educational years by leeching off Cedric&#39;s hard work. Their continued companionship from high school to university was largely thanks to the influential Lambert family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, for all his carelessness, Huntley possessed a genuine knack for making connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could easily engage a stranger on a park bench and find himself sharing snacks and stories within the hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything, Cedric remained in the dark about what Daniela&#39;s opinion of Huntley might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as Cedric observed Huntley engaging Daniela in animated conversation, a realization dawned on him-Daniela harbored no ill feelings toward Huntley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley&#39;s charm was undeniable. Whether he was making light remarks about the splendid weather or delving into complex discussions on international affairs, he navigated any topic with remarkable flair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the workday drawing to a close, Huntley waved Cedric off with a laid-back gesture, requesting he book a romantic dinner with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Cedric&#39;s face, his expression souring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley half-joked that if glares could be lethal, he would have been long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, at the restaurant, Cedric was about to seat himself when Huntley dismissively motioned him aside, claiming he needed a private moment with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze towards Daniela was laden with sorrow and a silent plea for understanding. Daniela, sensing that Huntley had something on his mind, opted to go along with his playful charade.A subtle smile tugged at her lips, but she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heartbroken yet resigned, Cedric nodded quietly and relocated to a distant table, where he ordered a flavorless salad that mirrored the emptiness he felt inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley thrived in his element, outshining his academic limitations with exceptional talent in other areas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He serenaded Daniela with a soulful violin solo, then seamlessly transitioned to the piano, transforming the evening into a vibrant spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at a distant table, Cedric clenched his cutlery with a white-knuckled grip. He made a silent vow-if Huntley had the audacity to invite Daniela to dance, he would send his fork flying in Huntley&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last notes of the piano resonated, Huntley flashed a mischievous smile at Daniela and remarked, &#34;Did you catch Cedric squirming in his seat? I&#39;ll cherish that image forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned the smile effortlessly, her gaze never drifting towards Cedric. &#34;Was tonight&#39;s grand act all about unsettling him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. My entire life, I&#39;ve been overshadowed by him. My parents lavish him with praise, wishing they had a son like Cedric. So when they sent me here to forge an alliance through marriage, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to outdo him at something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile remained steady. &#34;But your heart belongs to someone else. It&#39;s obvious I&#39;m not the one you truly want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of curiosity crossed Huntley&#39;s face before he chuckled. &#34;Oh really? And wheredid you pick that up from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve glanced at your phone eight times since you entered Harper Group. It&#39;s obvious you&#39;re anticipating a message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if it&#39;s something as simple as a message from my family? Not everything&#39;s about love,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, Daniela replied, &#34;That&#39;s not it.&#34; The reason was clear-throughout the day, Huntley&#39;s nervous demeanor had mirrored Cedric&#39;s usual anxiousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of concern that revealed a deep connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worry so pervasive, it consumed his thoughts, yet he struggled to voice it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley&#39;s grin widened as he flashed a thumbs-up. &#34;It&#39;s obvious why Cedric has liked you since we were kids. You&#39;re both sharp and insightful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by the revelation, Daniela&#39;s expression turned to one of surprise. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she asked, &#34;What did you just say? He&#39;s had feelings for me since we were kids?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Huntley raised his hands. &#34;Whoa, wait a second-you didn&#39;t know? Cedric&#39;s been crazy about you for at least ten years!</p>
