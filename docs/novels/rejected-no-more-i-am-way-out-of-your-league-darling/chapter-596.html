                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter was cold and scornful.&#34;Oh,,really? You care about me? Do you remember you slept with a flight attendant and framed my husband for it? Alexander, your understanding of love is so warped it&#39;s almost pitiable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander halted, visibly taken aback. A slow grin spread across his face. &#34;You still care about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes filled with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued, &#34;You&#39;re still keeping tabs on me, aren&#39;t you? Clearly, I haven&#39;t been erased from your heart. How else would you know about the flight attendant? Daniela, I swear to you, I&#39;m done with other women.I won&#39;t do anything that bothers you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was utterly shocked. Alexander&#39;s logic defied reason; it was completely absurd. She was talking about his audacity to blame Cedric for his own misdeeds. And yet, it seemed he was completely oblivious to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Daniela, you must have seen the efforts I&#39;m putting in to better myself, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of nausea swept over Daniela, her stomach twisting in revolt at his words. Then, without warning,she vomited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Alexander made a swift move towards her, but Daniela, quick as a flash, grabbed a fruit knife from the table, brandishing it defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay, I&#39;ll keep my distance. I get it, you&#39;re still fuming.&#34; Alexander conceded with a smile. &#34;Darling,it won&#39;t happen again. Just calm down, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, Daniela could bear no more and rushed towards the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander,concern etched on his features, followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suddenly, Cedric materialized before him, a storm of fury in his gaze. Without hesitation, Cedric snatched the knife and pressed its cold edge against his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t force me to repeat myself. Get out now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander cast a worried glance towards the restroom before retreating, his footsteps heavy with reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments after, Daniela emerged, looking ghostly pale. Cedric asked with concern,&#34;Did you consume something spoiled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed his concern with a weak wave of her hand and staggered back to the restroom to succumb to another bout of retching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Lillian breezed in from the chill outdoors, her eyebrows arching in alarm. &#34;What&#39;s going on? You&#39;re feeling this sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved her hand once more before settling into her chair. She pressed the intercom button and addressed Ryan with a sense of urgency. &#34;The facial recognition system is outdated. Alexander just strolled right in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stared at Daniela, her eyes wide with shock. &#34;Did Alexander really disturb you that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a moment, her hand resting on her stomach as if to calm it, before looking up. &#34;WVhat&#39;s the current situation downstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful air around Lillian dissipated instantly, her expression turning somber. &#34;It&#39;s a massacre down there! The back entrance of Elite Lux is completely soaked in blood. It&#39;s splattered all over the place. The corpse had been lying there all night, swarmed by flies and mosquitoes. Even the forensic team couldn&#39;t handle it; they were retching left and right. The stench of decay is so overwhelming, it carries for miles.They must have struck the body at least a dozen times. It&#39;s absolutely gruesome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite feeling nauseous, Daniela&#39;s mind remained sharp.&#34;What was used to kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian responded, &#34;A dinner knife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dinner knife?&#34; &#34;Yes, a blunt dinner knife.&#34; Lillian clarified. &#34;The wounds on the body are jagged; the blade wasn&#39;t sharp at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed as she connected the dots. &#34;A dinner knife suggests it happened during a meal. So,the killer was probably someone he knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Ryan appeared at the door. &#34;We&#39;re still piecing it together. Whoever did this knows our surveillance setup at Elite Lux like the back of their hand. They managed to drag the body in without appearing on any caeras, staying completely hidden in the blind spots.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chimed in, &#34;Moreover, every piece of surveillance footage of Marcus from last night has mysteriously disappeared. It&#39;s irretrievable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the computer, Daniela began to type, her fingers a blur on the keyboard, while Ryan looked over her shoulder, a mixture of curiosity and concern on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s clear they&#39;re onto us. They wiped the surveillance clean before we even thought to check it. Restoring the footage is beyond even my capabilities. They must have shelled out a hefty sumn for such a clean job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela halted her typing abruptly, staring at the blank screens that once held the surveillance data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a composed tone, she suggested, &#34;If the footage offers us nothing, then let&#39;s look into the eight association members. See if any of them have made any major expenses lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever hired the expert likely had a significant payout recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded in agreement. &#34;I&#39;ll dig into their finances. Expect my report by tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick nod, Daniela acknowledged his plan, and Ryan departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no further action to take, Lillian exited as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,concern etching his features, approached Daniela. &#34;This isn&#39;t normal. You&#39;ve been vomiting too much. Let&#39;s get you to a doctor today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a reassuring smile. &#34;The family doctor actually paid a visit while you were downstairs.&#34; &#34;And? What did he say?&#34; Cedric pressed, his anxiety palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely pointed to a document resting on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Cedric moved to inspect it, discovering a pregnancy test lying atop the paper, its two vivid red lines declaring new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from outside, Lillian could hear Cedric&#39;s laughter bursting through the office, loud and full of unfiltered excitement.</p>
