            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Peyton, her face etched with deep lines of age,suddenly beamed a wide smile. &#34;Alexander, you see, l invited you here because I want to know if you still harbor any feelings for Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander caught a glimpse of Katrina, who was covertly signaling him with winks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had vaguely mentioned some urgent business over the phone. However,Alexander was completely unprepared for such a direct personal query.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden strode into the room with a platter with fruits,which he placed on the center table, casting a meaningful glance at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing deeper to it. We&#39;re simply asking,&#34; Caiden remarked, extending an apple towards Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Alexander kept his thoughts to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatience crept into Peyton&#39;s tone. &#34;Speak, won&#39;t you? Without your words, how am I to assist you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton,always charmed by the unpolished honesty of country people, found herself quite taken with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression softened into a gentle, encouraging smile. &#34;Is it shyness that holds your tongue? Well then,let me pose it this way. If life hadn&#39;t thrown that unexpected twist, and you and Daniela were still married, do you reckon life would have been good with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a deep breath, weighing her question with a serious gaze. &#34;Yes, I believe it would have been.Daniela was the one who initiated our divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was indeed the reality of their situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never once entertained the notion of divorce after marrying Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela lacked ambition, her compliance was a trait he found to be adequately pleasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for her stubbornness, their lives would not have unfolded as they did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Peyton asked Alexander once more,&#34;So, if I managed to reunite you two, would you be open to that idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, who had been biting her tongue until now,burst out, &#34;Peyton, that&#39;s out of line. Alexander is destined to marry Joyce. We&#39;ve settled on that-he&#39;s my son-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Katrina&#39;s protests, Peyton	grasped Alexander&#39;s hand with a sincere expression.&#34;Alexander, what do you say? If you&#39;re willing, I&#39;ll make it work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on his father&#39;s recent conversation with Daniela, Alexander hesitated momentarily before responding to Peyton, &#34;I don&#39;t think she&#39;d want to marry me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his admission, Peyton slapped her thigh. Caiden&#39;s face softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fret over it. I&#39;ll take care of everything. Daniela isn&#39;t foolish; who else would she choose over a catch like you? Yes, she&#39;s quick-tempered, but overlook that for now. Just sit tight and wait for my update-I&#39;ll speak to her, and soon you&#39;ll be on your way to making her your bride again. Trust me, I&#39;ll sort this out flawlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had previously crossed paths with Peyton.She consistently preferred the company of boys to girls. In her perspective, Daniela was scarcely noteworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had frequently caught Peyton openly disparaging Daniela as a pointless expense, voicing her criticism loudly and without any hesitation.  His trust in Peyton&#39;s remarks was thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his eyes, he noticed Caiden offering a surprisingly affectionate smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a soft and reassuring voice, Caiden comforted him.&#34;Mom assured us she&#39;d take care of everything. Just head home and stay tuned for updates. Remember,Joyce was the one who acted out of turn and shook up your marriage. If you&#39;re still harboring feelings for Daniela, it&#39;s only right that you receive some form of fairness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging the advice, Alexander stood up decisively. &#34;I&#39;ll go and talk it over with my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard,Katrina remained motionless nearby,her eyes wide as she watched the two men conclude their business just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word was said about Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burning with indignation, Katrina nearly sprinted after Alexander, but Caiden grabbed her arm, stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whirled around, her eyes cold as she faced Caiden.&#34;What are you suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning naivety, Caiden explained,&#34;The timing is off.Joyce is pregnant, and marrying into the Bennett family under these conditions would only lead to disdain. You&#39;d have to promise a hefty dowry. The Bennett family isn&#39;t known for being gullible. If the dowry seems insufficient,would they even consider it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression turned from shock to sheer disbelief. Gazing intensely at Caiden, she challenged him. &#34;Caiden! What exactly are you implying? Didn&#39;t we settle on a plan earlier? All the Harper family&#39;s wealth is going to Joyce! Are you seriously thinking of not keeping your word?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden could muster a reply, Peyton exclaimed,&#34;What did you just say? Joyce is pregnant? And the baby isn&#39;t Alexander&#39;s? You plan to bestow the entire Harper family&#39;s fortune as Joyce&#39;s dowry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s reaction was fierce. &#34;Katrina, over my dead body will you touch a dime of the Harper family&#39;s assets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt like she was on the verge of losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years,she had weathered countless difficulties,all for the sake of Caiden. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it all for a share of the Harper family&#39;s fortune?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was all her dedication to be disregarded with a mere word from Caiden, demanding she forfeit her claim?That was utterly unthinkable. Suddenly, the entire house plunged into turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the company, Daniela felt a sense of unease creeping over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had shown up with a sketchbook similar to hers, suggesting they knew about the original one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swept the papers off her desk and informed Lillian,&#34;I need to return to the Harper family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Lillian turned around, only to discover that Daniela had vanished without a trace.</p>
