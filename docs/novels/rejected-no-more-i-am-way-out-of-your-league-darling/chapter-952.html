                <p>he McCoy brothers replied in unison, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.ara said into the phone, &#34;Well, if Daniela is serious bout acquiring McCoy Group, just sit back and wait.&#39;ou&#39;re already on the shelf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he McCoy brothers were stunned. &#34;Wait, what? Are &#39;ou being serious right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ara asked, &#34;Why would Daniela even bother with AcCoy Group? There&#39;s no upside. You&#39;ve got no big 규lients left, and the only thing of value-your mineral m upply-was gone. What&#39;s left is nothing but a shell.Nhat is she running, a charity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>3rad went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So did Jules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Ethan had nothing to say either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>3rad finally asked, &#34;Lara, is it really that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.ara didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;It&#39;s exactly that bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>3rad let out a slow breath and shut his eyes. &#34;Alright.Go ahead and get back to work.&#34; Then he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three brothers looked at one another,sharing the same silent reaction-this was a disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the conference room, Daniela noticed the shift in their expressions the second they walked in.She didn&#39;t waste time. &#34;So, what&#39;s your decision? You either walk away now, or I take full control of McCoy Group.Also...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked toward the crowd gathered at the door. &#34;I&#39;m not unreasonable. If you can work under me,you&#39;ll have a place here. But if I find out anyone&#39;s hiding something or acting shady, don&#39;t expect mercy.This is your one shot. If you&#39;d rather walk, HR will take care of your severance. But if you want to stay and do your job, I&#39;ll welcome it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees looked at her and one thought ran through their heads. She wasn&#39;t someone to mess with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze back to the McCoy brothers.&#34;I&#39;ve said what I needed to. You&#39;re free to leave. Now it&#39;s your turn. You know why I&#39;m here. I&#39;ve uncovered the truth about what happened to my mother. And I haven&#39;t forgotten the explosion from all those years ago. I lost my child in that blast. And that&#39;s not something I&#39;ll ever forgive. I&#39;m giving you three days.That&#39;s all. If one of you steps up and tells me who was behind it, I&#39;ll let the rest go. But if you all stay silent,I&#39;ll come at you with everything I&#39;ve got. You know l don&#39;t hold back. I don&#39;t forgive. And I don&#39;t let things go. Speak now. Tell the truth about what happened.This is the only shot you&#39;ll get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was about to walk out when his brothers stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton!&#34; Brad&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;You&#39;re really going to walk away without saying anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added, &#34;Come on! We&#39;re your own flesh and blood. That has to count for something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stepped forward. &#34;Look, my family had nothing to do with that explosion. We weren&#39;t involved. Now Daniela&#39;s asking for names, but we honestly don&#39;t know who did it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad tried again. &#34;She&#39;s your daughter-in-law. Can&#39;t you talk to her? Ask her to give us a little room to breathe. We&#39;re still family, right? Isn&#39;t peace better than all this fighting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded. &#34;Exactly! You know how badly Josh treated us. The least you could do is show us some kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added, &#34;You always listened to Father. When he passed,he asked you to look after us. You remember that,don&#39;t you?&#34; But Jules stayed firm. &#34;Josh is still our big brother.Daniela&#39;s not one of us. She doesn&#39;t really belong in this family. If things go south, Josh might cut us some slack. Can we say the same for her? You&#39;ve seen what she&#39;s like. Daniela doesn&#39;t forgive. And she never backs down.&#34;</p>
