                <p>Cedric was just about to step out of the house when Lillian caught his arm.&#34;Daniela knows what she&#39;s doing.Cedric,stay home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But sitting still wasn&#39;t an option for him-he felt like he was losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expectant gaze had been full of scheming, and now that she was backed into a corner, there was no telling what she might do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone made Cedric restless; he couldn&#39;t relax,not even for a moment. &#34;Just tell me-what is Daniela up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stepped in front of him, holding up a hand.&#34;Just wait for Daniela. She&#39;ll explain everything when she gets back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a bitter laugh. &#34;She never does.&#34; She always carried the weight of everything by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant,it hit him-Daniela had never truly seen him as her husband, or even as family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the hotel room, Linden&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement as he stared at Daniela lying unconscious in the bed. &#34;Daniela! It&#39;s really her! How did you pull this off?&#34; Elyse folded her arms and smirked. &#34;Pull it off? Oh please. As her aunt, all it took was inviting her for a simple coffee. She walked right into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s excitement was obvious, but he also looked a little disappointed. &#34;Shame she&#39;s knocked out.It&#39;d be much more entertaining if she were awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse smirked mischievously. &#34;Relax. She&#39;s being hypnotized. She&#39;ll wake up soon, completely convinced you&#39;re Cedric, and trust me, she&#39;ll be all over you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That instantly lifted Linden&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatience took over as he began stripping off his clothes. &#34;Live fast, die young! Daniela, here I come!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a look at Elyse. &#34;Hey, old lady, why are you still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse eyed his restless energy and let out a cold chuckle. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Once she wakes up,you&#39;ll have more than enough time to enjoy. The hypnosis lasts fifteen hours-plenty for your little game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden let out a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse added, &#34;After tonight, you&#39;d better keep your word and get rid of Daniela like I asked. If you don&#39;t.I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden dismissed her with a casual wave,signaling her to go. Just then, Daniela&#39;s phone buzzed, and Linden glanced at the caller ID-Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk crossed his face as he snapped a picture of Daniela in the bed. With a wicked grin, he typed,&#34;Your wife,my bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way out,Elyse peeked through the gap in the door, catching sight of Linden slipping off his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sneer formed on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee? Daniela? What did it matter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in the end, they all fell apart at her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shut the door with a soft click and headed downstairs to meet Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela and Linden were finished,the lobby would be crawling with reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of it made a sinister smile creep across Elyse&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, Linden stood in nothing but his underwear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to act when Daniela&#39;s eyes fluttered open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was still caught up in his excitement, thinking she was under hypnosis. He waved his hands eagerly,completely unaware of what was coming. But in the blink of an eye, everything turned pitch black-someone had thrown something over his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, he found himself tied to a chair with a white bed sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden had no idea what had just happened. He didn&#39;t even try to fight back. Instead, he stared at her,utterly mesmerized. &#34;Daniela, playing rough,are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast him a brief glance and smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was completely entranced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure he was firmly restrained, Daniela dragged a chair over and sat down in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden sat there,waiting,convinced she&#39;d take the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched between them until Linden finally frowned, his eyes locking onto Daniela&#39;s calm,steady gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t hypnotized? Who the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a doctor, he quickly sensed that something was very,very wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! The guy Elyse hired is one of the best-there&#39;s no chance the hypnosis didn&#39;t work. Daniela,what kind of trick are you pulling?&#34; Daniela tilted her head slightly, her fingers reaching for the fruit knife resting on the table. Linden flinched and instinctively shrank back. &#34;What are you doing? Listen, Daniela, you know murder is a crime, right? You&#39;re the richest person in the world-there&#39;s no need to get your hands dirty over me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back, effortlessly spinning the fruit knife in her hand.</p>
