                <p>Jules led Ethan to Josh&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting at the doorway, Josh flashed a broad,artificial grin. &#34;You guys sure know how to keep someone waiting. I&#39;ve been out here forever. What took you so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules had previously promised Josh that he would bring both Jules and Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, where&#39;s Brad?&#34; Josh asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules filled him in on the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark storm brewed behind Josh&#39;s eyes, his smile slipping away. &#34;You&#39;re telling me Brad picked Daniela over us? He went with an outsider? I thought he had brains, but clearly, I gave him too much credit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward Ethan, Josh dialed up the charm again.&#34;Knew you&#39;d make the right call, Ethan. Stick with me,and life will get a whole lot sweeter, no more bowing and scraping. How much did you manage to walk away with from MAcCoy Group? Let&#39;s have it, and I&#39;ll put it all to good use in my company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A number rolled off Ethan&#39;s lips. Displeasure flickered in Josh&#39;s eyes. &#34;That&#39;s it? You can&#39;t be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan kept silent, swallowing the bitterness. Most of the money had already been taken by Josh,yet he had the audacity to complain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only through Daniela&#39;s sense of decency did Ethan hold on to anything at all. If anyone else had been in charge,he might have left empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought twisted inside him. Daniela&#39;s kindness was genuine, a far cry from Josh&#39;s scheming ways. Regret gnawed at him, and the more he replayed it in his mind,the more he wished he&#39;d thrown in his lot with her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked away his phone, hiding his bank balance from sight. A forced smile accompanied his words.&#34;Honestly, it&#39;s not much. To be honest, I feel a little embarrassed. Let me see if I can gather up more.Next time,I&#39;ll come back with a real sum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ready to slip out when Jules caught his arm,reading the warning in Josh&#39;s eyes. &#34;Come on, Ethan,don&#39;t say that. We&#39;re brothers, right? Josh would never judge you over something like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s grin stretched wider, more plastic than ever.&#34;Naturally. Family means everything. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a little less. Here, take my account number and just wire it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered on Ethan&#39;s face. &#34;Just transfer it?That&#39;s all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. We&#39;re family. Do you really believe we need to waste our time on all that legal paperwork?&#34;Josh turned to Ethan, impatience flashing in his eyes.&#34;Are you saying you don&#39;t trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill edged his next words. &#34;You honestly think I&#39;d do you dirty? Out of all the brothers, I&#39;ve always looked out for you. Remember when you wanted to go abroad and nobody else would help? Who slipped you cash every month, even when the family turned their backs? I&#39;ve always had your back. Why would I ever cheat you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.A sense of obligation had always tugged at Ethan because of the money Josh sent for his studies abroad;he was never allowed to forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to let it hold him this time, Ethan drew a line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breath later, he bit back his nerves and spoke up.&#34;Even brothers should keep money straight. Things are different now, and this is all I have. If anything goes wrong, things could get very hard for me and my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes narrowed, his tone turning sharp. &#34;What could go wrong, exactly? Do you really believe I&#39;m worried about your pocket change?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh followed. &#34;So you don&#39;t trust me. Not much more to say, is there? It&#39;s just sad we&#39;ve come to this as brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the atmosphere could sour further, Jules chimed in, &#34;Come on, Ethan. Why stir up trouble?You&#39;re just making Josh feel unappreciated. Don&#39;t forget, he&#39;s the one protecting us now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Ethan kept his voice low. &#34;We&#39;re talking real money here. Shouldn&#39;t you think twice?Remember, most of what we had is gone, and it&#39;s because Josh got his hands on it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules shrugged, trying to reassure him. &#34;I get it, but Josh explained everything. He wasn&#39;t out to cheat anyone. He just wanted to keep Daniela from grabbing the assets. He promised to make it right. Besides, look at the bigger picture: if Daniela has a son, she and Cedric will get everything, and we&#39;ll all be answering to her. Thanks to Josh, we each control our own shares now. Isn&#39;t that better for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion lingered in Ethan&#39;s eyes.&#34;But Lara said-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules waved him off. &#34;Lara? She&#39;s still learning the ropes. We&#39;re the brothers holding this family together.Daniela&#39;s only got Hamilton&#39;s shares, that&#39;s all. Oiscoll is our ground. Stick with me, and everything here is still in our hands.&#34; While Ethan hesitated, Jules smoothly fished out his phone and transferred the funds straight to Josh before Ethan could stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit Ethan like a splash of cold water.&#34;What the hell,Jules?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing, Jules slung an arm over his shoulder.&#34;Relax.You never changed your password, not once. It&#39;s done,the money&#39;s with Josh now. He&#39;ll put it to good use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exchange left Ethan brooding, and when his phone buzzed with a new message from Brad, a fresh wave of frustration hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Brad&#39;s words read, &#34;Dinner at my place tonight. Just the two of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan quickly typed a reply. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
