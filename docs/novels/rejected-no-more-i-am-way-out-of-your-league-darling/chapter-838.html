                <p>Carol lingered outside the elevator, immediately spotting how rattled Cedric was, his shirt already clinging to him with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, are you okay? Are you coming out or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Carol stepped in closer. &#34;Hey, Cedric. Talk to me. What happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a moment for Cedric to focus, but eventually he turned to Carol, voice flat.&#34;Did you hear? Arthur got cut up more than twenty times. Someone used a blade on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol just shrugged. &#34;That sounds dramatic, but he&#39;s not in any real danger. Daniela knows how to handle herself. It looks worse than it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot her a look. &#34;How would you even know that? Did you see for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shook her head, unfazed. &#34;Trust me, Daniela&#39;s always been precise, she never makes mistakes. Are you really surprised? You do know who she is, right? She&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Carol clamped her hand over her mouth, realizing she&#39;d said too much. But the damage was already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s thoughts spun out of control. Everything he believed about his gentle wife crumbled in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From down the hall, Daniela&#39;s voice carried out from the office. &#34;Cedric? Carol? What are you two doing out there?&#34;·Her tone held a hint of confusion as she caught sight of Carol&#39;s uneasy expression and Cedric&#39;s stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave Daniela a quick warning glance, then hurried off before she could say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left in the awkward silence,Daniela pressed her lips together and faced Cedric, waiting for him to speak. &#34;Are you...&#34; Cedric could barely get the words out, his voice shaking. All at once, it hit him just how blind he&#39;d been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hints had always been right in front of him, yet he chose to look the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at Daniela with a sense of awe and confusion, barely able to form the question. &#34;You&#39;re Clarinda? The one in charge of Cealmaur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say.a word. She didn&#39;t have to, as her eyes told Cedric everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can that really be true?&#34; Cedric had never backed down from chaos, rivalries, or even the nastiest business disputes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But leading Cealmaur? That was on another level entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a position only reserved for the absolute best, a legend forged in battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, how could Daniela, someone who couldn&#39;t stand the sight of blood,be Clarinda?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her greatest fear had always been blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying such a secret must have weighed on Daniela for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s shock quickly turned to heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself struggling to speak, lips trembling, more afraid than he&#39;d ever been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to say something, but Cedric stopped her with a small gesture with his hand.&#34;Let me process all of this. I&#39;ll head home and cook dinner for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric stepped back into the elevator and hit the button for the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors slid shut slowly, hiding his pale, troubled face from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing there, Daniela watched Cedric go, weighed down by guilt. She knew just how much he was struggling to handle the truth. Carol approached and asked, &#34;Daniela, why does Cedric look like he&#39;s seen a ghost? Isn&#39;t it kind of cool being Clarinda? You run an international mercenary group. Most people would see that as a badge of honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply pressed her lips together, giving no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Alexander remembered Arthur,Arthur had already been rushed to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than twenty precise cuts, all bloody but none reaching the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doctor examined Arthur&#39;s wounds, he let out a whistle. &#34;Whoever did this has serious skill. These cuts are neat, controlled, and fast. Honestly, if this person went to med school, they&#39;d be an incredible surgeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander could only sigh. &#34;Just focus on patching him up, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor gave a reassuring nod. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s not in danger. The wounds look nasty, but he&#39;ll bounce back after some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Alexander reported everything to Hamilton, who exploded with frustration.&#34;I&#39;m sending another team. We must find out what Daniela&#39;s weakness is this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, Arthur was finally regaining consciousness. Alexander leaned over, lowering his voice.&#34;You&#39;ve met Daniela twice now. Did you figure out what her weakness is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flickered in Arthur&#39;s eyes as he quickly shook his head. &#34;No, I swear, I have no idea! I don&#39;t know anything!&#34;</p>
