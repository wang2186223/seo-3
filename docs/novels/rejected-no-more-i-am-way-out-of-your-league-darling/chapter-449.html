                <p>Natalie reiterated,&#34;One hundred million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse gulped. &#34;Where am I supposed to come up with that kind of money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes, catching the flicker of hesitation in Elyse&#39;s gaze. &#34;Selling this villa would fetch exactly one hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pressed on, &#34;You promised, didn&#39;t you? You said one villa was no big deal. Once Daniela and Cedric are gone, the Harper family&#39;s fortune will be yours. Then a villa-whether one, ten, or even a hundred-won&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had, in fact,said those very words.&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, Mom? Having second thoughts? Have you changed your mind about killing Daniela? Did you strike some kind of deal with her? Do you not want her dead anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was perceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse retorted, &#34;Wait, one hundred million is just for Daniela. What about Cedric? If he lives, we won&#39;t get a dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smirked. &#34;Before the assassin takes out Daniela, have Cedric completey undler my spell and many me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse eyed Natalie skeptically: &#34;You? Are you serious?You&#39;re pretty, but compored to Daniela-in looks.talent, brains, and strategy-you&#39;re lacking. Do you really think Cechic would pick you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s jow dropped at her mother&#39;s blunt words.&#34;Mom,what did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked away. &#34;Tm just stating the truth. Youve been at Elite Lux for quite a while, but Cedric barely pays you any attention. if anything, he ta&#39;s to Nina more than he talks to you. r&#39;il think it over, r&#39;m heading upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Elyse rushed upstairs, leaving Natalie behind.watching her retreating figure with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Natalie dialed a law firm. &#34;Hello,r&#39;d like to know how to sell a villa that&#39;s under my mother&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer responded. &#34;Unless the owner consents.you have no authority to sell it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, the lawyer continued, &#34;However, it the owner passes away, as the heiress, you&#39;d have the right to sell it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie ended the call, her mind churning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Lillian glanced at Daniola, puzzled. &#34;Daniela.are you seriously giving Elyse that land for a  retirement home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely glanced up from her phone. &#34;You really think that&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian frowned.&#34;Then why buy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked. &#34;It&#39;s Cedric&#39;s birthday gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gasped. &#34;That&#39;s beyond extravagant!&#34; A birthday gift costing over a billion was unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned in. &#34;And Elyse? What&#39;s your move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile waned slightly. &#34;Once desperation hits,they&#39;ll turn to their backer. Just wait a little more;the time is near.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s car neared the villa, her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out to take the call,while Lillian crossed her arms,waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thrilled voice crackled through. &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s a hundred-million-dollar hit on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze flicked to the glowing villa. Through the vast windows, the interior was clearly visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,now in fresh lounge wear,lounged on the sofa,engaged in a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her other phone buzzed, yet she chose not to answer right away.Instead. Daniela addressed the caller, &#34;Russell, did they send the money?&#34; She suspected Natalie was behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope. They just mentioned selling a villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, our doors are open to all. If they bring business, accept it.&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell chuckled.&#34;Who&#39;s feeling generous enough to spend that much on your head? So,Daniela,how would you like to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she could reply, the villa door swung open.revealing Cedric stepping into the light, approaching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with the jokes. Ensure they pay up quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell snickered. &#34;Imagine their reaction when they realize they&#39;re funding our boss&#39;s assassination.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coolly. &#34;I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;Who was that? What assassination?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. &#34;No one. You must be mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night,in bed, a bedside lamp cast a warm glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle, amber light stretched across the floor and walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a fervent moment, Cedric pulled Daniela close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>murmured against her ear. &#34;I know there&#39;s a lot ve. keep from me, but Daniela, I&#39;m your husband.Do you get that? I know I can&#39;t sway you, but let me be clear about this. Daniela, you don&#39;t have to share everything with me, but if you allow yourself to be hurt, it will break me.&#34;</p>
