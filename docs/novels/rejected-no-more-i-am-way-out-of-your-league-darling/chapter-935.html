                <p>Cedric stood beside Daniela. His eyes cut across the faces staring back at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family shuffled backward, fear gripping their steps. One thought flashed in their minds.Neither Cedric nor Daniela were easy to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sank into the couch, her expression calm as she asked, &#34;What do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad threw Cedric a wounded look but forced a grin.He shoved the ginseng box forward and said, &#34;We&#39;re family. Daniela, since you&#39;re expecting, we thought we should check on you. See this? It&#39;s ginseng.Top grade. We brought it just for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric eyed the box and saw the ginseng sitting inside. &#34;We are not family,&#34; he said, his tone frosty.&#34;I have never accepted the McCoy name.&#34;  A shadow crossed Brad&#39;s face at those words. How could Cedric be this ungrateful? People outside begged to tie their name to the McCoy family, yet Cedric treated them like poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing down his pride, Brad smiled. &#34;No need for hurtful words. We share blood, so that makes us family. Daniela is carrying a baby, and we&#39;re thrilled for her. We just dropped by to see her. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his eyes to Carol, who stood nearby with arms folded. To him, Carol was nothing more than a servant. They could not offend Daniela, but tearing down someone below her was fair game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad continued, &#34;Your servant crossed a line. She didn&#39;t greet us right and then got rude. She even laid hands on Ethan. Look at his finger! Cedric, Daniela is expecting now. The people close to her matter most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes glinted with slyness. &#34;Then again, you just moved to Oiscoll. No surprise you don&#39;t have trusted folks yet. What if I help you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad faked a sweet smile. &#34;I can send you proper staff, inside and outside, to keep everything neat.Trust me. These are my people, and you&#39;ll like them.How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught every bit of his sly plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Brad schemed, the smarter he felt. If his people slipped in, he would have all the chances in the world to get rid of the baby growing in Daniela&#39;s belly..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela lost this child, after two miscarriages,maybe she would never carry again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with his idea, Bradtraded looks with his family. They nodded back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes hardened. He would not let these snakes linger a second longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Cedric a reassuring look then said,&#34;Carol is family to me. She&#39;s no servant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught the McCoy family off guard. No one expected Daniela to treat her assistant as family. Silence settled in for a moment. They always held themselves high, too proud to show warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad broke the pause and said, &#34;Daniela, with respect, a servant stays a servant. How can you call her family? But since you claim Carol is family, you better explain how she dared to break one of our fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head and met Carol&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stilled, thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys folded their arms, waiting for an answer.Wasn&#39;t Daniela supposed to be ruthless? If so,shouldn&#39;t Carol pay with a finger too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys hid their delight behind smug faces,eager for Daniela to squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unexpectedly, Daniela asked Carol, &#34;Did they hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,standing strong with arms folded, gave a grin.&#34;No. Trash like that can&#39;t touch me.&#34; Daniela nodded once. &#34;Good to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced Brad and said, &#34;Since no harm was done,I&#39;ll let this slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys stared at her, lost for words. Damn.Daniela really shielded her people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad picked up Ethan&#39;s broken finger with a shaky hand. &#34;That&#39;s it? You&#39;re not serious, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose from the couch. Outside, the light faded. Shadows crept in, carving edges on her cold face. She locked eyes with Brad and asked, &#34;Want it fair? I&#39;ll snap your finger too. He won&#39;t feel lonely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad met her stare. Though taller, he shrank inside and forced down a gulp. &#34;No. There&#39;s no need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her eyes on him, voice sharp. &#34;Is there more to talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;No. There&#39;s nothing left to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, her icy glare softened into bored dismissal. We didn&#39;t plan for visitors today. Better leave before lunch starts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys looked stunned. They barely sat down,yet she pushed them out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lingered awkwardly, unwilling to budge, Ethan&#39;s hand throbbing in the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was her sense of manners now?</p>
