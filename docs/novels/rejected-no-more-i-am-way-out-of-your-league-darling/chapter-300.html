                <p>Caiden seethed with anger after Cedric flatly refused to send him back to Zentara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nowhere else to go, he crashed at a friend&#39;s house for a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela came to pick him up, his face was twisted in frustration. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re really heartless. Do you actually expect me to face Katrina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance in his direction. While playing on her phone, she replied, &#34;You&#39;re a witness to this whole thing. You can&#39;t just walk away now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had limited Caiden to a mere five hundred dollars per month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Broke and out of options, Caiden had no place to turn. Desperate, he even toyed with the idea of selling the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, anyone wealthy enough to consider buying it had already heard Daniela&#39;s ominous warning.&#34;Anyone who dares to purchase Caiden&#39;s villa is declaring war on Elite Lux.&#34; Despite the price had been slashed repeatedly, no one dared to finalizethe sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Caiden was reminded of the sheer reach of Daniela&#39;s power in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling defeated, he abandoned his schemes altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Late that night, as darkness cloaked the area, a car pulled up to the front gate of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It paused for just a moment before speeding away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, the security guard went to check and discovered a burlap sack lying on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened it, he was horrified to find a woman inside, her hair tangled and a filthy rag gagging her.  He aimed his flashlight at her face and recoiled in shock. He shouted, &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By chance, Daniela was driving past at that exact moment. She recognized the woman as Joyce and called Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had passed out, and an overwhelming stench clung to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina rushed over but quickly realized she couldn&#39;t move Joyce on her own. Reluctantly, she called Caiden for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he approached and caught a whiff of the foul odor, he couldn&#39;t hold back and vomited on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, one of the guards stepped in, pinching his nose as he dragged Joyce into the villa, treating her as if she were nothing more than discarded trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, Joyce?&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice quivered as she took in the jagged cuts marring Joyce&#39;s once-smooth face. The evidence of Joyce&#39;s brutal torment was undeniable. When she finally regained consciousness, her mind seemed shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed Katrina&#39;s arm tightly, her sobs erupting uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, please save me! Those people are monsters.They said if I don&#39;t pay by next week, they&#39;ll take me back. I&#39;d rather die than face them again. Please,Mom,help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by panic, her body gave out, and she fainted once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the harsh overhead lights illuminated Joyce&#39;s wounds, Caiden&#39;s eyes widened in horror at the word etched into her skin: bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sickening jolt struck his chest as he turned to Daniela, only to find her face devoid of any reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, an unsettling fear of his own daughter crept into Caiden&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his trembling hands into fists, he waited until Katrina escorted Joyce to the bathroom before leaning towards Daniela and whispering, &#34;Did you have someone do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a cold, indifferent glance his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was convinced that Daniela had to be behind this.Lowering his voice, he said, &#34;Even if you have a grudge against Katrina, Joyce had nothing to do with it. Don&#39;t you think this is too far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a chuckle, her tone laced with mockery.&#34;Oh? You really think this is too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gave a solemn nod. &#34;Of course it&#39;s too much!If those scars on her face become permanent, her life will be ruined. How could you do something so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments earlier, the sight of Joyce&#39;s mutilated face had shocked everyone. Yet Daniela&#39;s composure remained eerily undisturbed, her gaze chillingly indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold detachment in her eyes was nothing short  of terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s cold smile lingered. &#34;Heartless? Me? I wasn&#39;t always this way. I used to be hopeful, even innocent. Do you remember that? What Joyce suffered today might have been from a knife, but when I lost my mother, the wounds I endured were invisible yet far deeper. Did you ever stop to consider how broken I was back then? Of course not. I didn&#39;t scream or cry, so my pain went unnoticed. I was left to suffer alone, wasn&#39;t l? And yet, you seem to have forgotten someone who once loved me more than life itself. That person died because of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fiery glint ignited in Daniela&#39;s eyes, her voice steady but charged with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The question isn&#39;t whether I orchestrated what happened to Joyce. What matters is that | could. You better hope you weren&#39;t involved in my mom&#39;s death,because if you were, I&#39;ll make sure your fate is far worse than Joyce&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she dismissed him entirely, her attention snapping back to the TV without a second glance. Caiden stood frozen, her words sending an icy jolt straight to his core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart raced wildly, and his legs trembled so much he could barely keep himself upright. After a few failed attempts to speak, he finally stammered out a shaky protest. &#34;I had nothing to do with it. I swear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even blink in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Katrina&#39;s muffled sobs echoed through the halls as she carefully bathed Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid descended the stairs, her face pale. She hesitated before telling Caiden, &#34;Sir, the scars are not just on her face. They&#39;re everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to a whisper. &#34;Even her most private parts have been carved with the word &#39;bitch.&#39;&#34;</p>
