                <p>A heavy silence hung on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; patience was wearing thin. &#34;Ghost, speak up.Who hurt you? Was it the leader of Lone Wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s hand quivered slightly as he gripped the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, the horrors of that day haunted him like a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from Daniela, he had never faced an adversary so formidable. It felt as though every move he made was predicted with uncanny accuracy, his every intention laid bare and effortlessly blocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around Cedric, Ghost felt exposed-an open book,where no secret could remain hidden and retaliation was an impossible thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, overwhelming despair flooded him, sinking him deeper into fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, that person carved the words&#34;get lost&#34;into his face, a mark of disgrace, each stroke slicing deeper into his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ghost,will you speak or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Cedric Phillips,&#34; Ghost finally choked out, his body trembling at the very mention of the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did you say?&#34; Nikolas was momentarily stunned. &#34;Ghost, did you say something? I didn&#39;t catch that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost responded, &#34;That day, I saw Cedric descend and chase him into the dark alley. I&#39;m certain it was him, and he&#39;s from Lone Wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen, the phone heavy in his hand,as time seemed to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though a sudden storm had torn through an otherwise clear sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of utter devastation washed over him. Ghost sighed deeply. &#34;I&#39;ve reported to your father.From today, I&#39;m officially retiring. If there&#39;s nothing else,I&#39;ll hang up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling sensation ran down Nikolas&#39; spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Ghost&#39;s words sank in, Nikolas&#39; voice burst out.&#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost asked, &#34;Is there something more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ghost, you&#39;ve seen me grow up. Out of all my brothers, you&#39;ve always looked out for me the most,and I&#39;ve always respected you. Now, I need to ask a favor. Will you help me?&#34; Nikolas said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s response was simple. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my father&#39;s eyes, Cedric was nothing at first. But now,because of Daniela, my father&#39;s begun favoring him. If he discovers that Cedric is the head of Lone Wolf, and that he defeated you, none of us five brothers will have a chance to establish ourselves in the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost fell silent, his mind racing. Nikolas pressed on. &#34;I trust you won&#39;t tell my father that Cedric is the leader of Lone Wolf.Let&#39;s keep this out of the conversation from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost lingered in silence for a long stretch before finally agreeing. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. No matter who becomes the future leader, we&#39;ll at least ensure we leave a way out for each other. But Cedric wasn&#39;t raised with us, and he doesn&#39;t share our mother. He won&#39;t show us mercy,so please, you must keep this secret for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nikolas found no peace within himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one leading Lone Wolf, Zahir himself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood as the head of Cealmaur, Clarinda!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what did that make the rest of them? Mere pawns in a much larger game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing their true identities, Nikolas realized that any attempt to harm them would only bring disgrace upon himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas inhaled deeply from his cigarette, exhaling the smoke before instructing the driver, &#34;To the National Commerce Association. I need to find Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander&#39;s secretary relayed that Nikolas had arrived, he was utterly taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, didn&#39;t you say just days ago that I was of no use to you? What changed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas settled into the chair, exuding the confidence of the eldest son of the world&#39;s richest man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took another drag from his cigar and replied in a calm tone, &#34;I&#39;ve changed my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander studied Nikolas&#39; profile, his gaze icy.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Daniela and Cedric had shaken Nikolas, and now, he was eager to reclaim some sense of dominance, even if it meant with Alexander. &#34;Whether I choose to cooperate with you is up to me,&#34; Nikolas declared, crossing his legs with arrogant ease. &#34;It&#39;s not about whether you are willing.Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander closed his eyes, barely able to tolerate Nikolas&#39; arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the prospect of drawing closer to Daniela made him swallow his pride. &#34;What exactly do you have in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas casually dusted off his pants, his voice nonchalant. &#34;Starting today, you&#39;ll be my secretary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m the president of the largest commerce association in the country.Be your secretary? Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re inflating your importance a bit too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him-the president of the National Commerce Association-to become Nikolas&#39; lackey, what would others think?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would also undermine his dignity as president.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Nikolas overestimating his worth? Sure, he might be the heir to the McCoy family, but he wasn&#39;t there yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas saw right through Alexander&#39;s thoughts and sneered. &#34;The access cards to Elite Lux and Phillips Group-they&#39;ve expired, haven&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face tightened at the reminder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only used them once, and the second time he tried, they didn&#39;t work and he had been thrown out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that point on, he could only watch from afar as Daniela remained out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you take the position, you can accompany me and enter Elite Lux and Phillips Group without any trouble,&#34; Nikolas added.</p>
