                <p>Joyce had been married Doug for a while. She had mastered the art of torturing people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t imagine lowering himself to the extent Joyce had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when Joyce presented her conditions, he scoffed at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to claw his way out of the abyss, he threw himself into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began slashing profits to attract partnerships,attending minor events he once dismissed as beneath him, and courting small businesses he had long ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t clueless-far from it. His years in business hadn&#39;t been idle. He knew the game. So,the day he scored a new client, he was all smiles as he swung by to pick Richard up from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This deal looks promising. But with such a hefty deposit, can you manage it?&#34; Richard sighed heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll figure something out. You just focus on getting better, Dad,&#34; Alexander replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard fell silent, his brows furrowing in thought.Finally, he said, &#34;I still have over five million on hand.For the rest, you might have to consider selling our villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stiffened, his jaw tightening. &#34;But you&#39;ve always said the villa is Grandpa&#39;s legacy. You swore we&#39;d never touch it, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard said with a weary sigh, &#34;But what choice do we have? We can&#39;t just sit back and watch the Bennett family fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes darkened. After a moment, he spoke, his voice quiet but firm. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,Dad.I&#39;ll find a way to save the Bennett family-and the villa.&#34; With that, Richard waved him off, retreating upstairs to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family&#39;s assets were already mortgaged to the hilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, they were still short by over ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man who had grown up surrounded by privilege, who had once basked in the glow of Daniela&#39;s unwavering devotion, Alexander found himself in uncharted territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in his wildest dreams did he think ten million wouId ever keep him up at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to every connection he had across Olisvine, but even after exhausting every favor,he was still eight million short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as desperation began to creep in, his phone buzzed with a message from Joyce. &#34;Have you thought it through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her name made his blood boil. His grip tightened around the phone, his knuckles turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as his options dwindled, he felt the walls closing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been hanging by a thread, down to his last roll of the dice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her words-be Joyce&#39;s slave-hung over him like a guillotine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasn&#39;t just offering help; she was dangling it like bait, knowing full well the humniliation it would cost him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as Daniela left work, Alexander waited for her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Daniela asked, her tone laced with disdain. Just the sight of him seemed to sour her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had to swallow his pride, he&#39;d rather do it in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you lend me ten million dollars?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; need it urgently,&#34; he continued. &#34;Just for a month.I&#39;ll pay you back with interest. Market rate, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela just looked at him. &#34;Given our history, do you really think it&#39;s appropriate to come to me? Or do you think we&#39;re close enough for this kind of favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela cut him off with a shake of her head. &#34;We&#39;re divorced,Alexander.What makes you think you have the right to ask me for anything? Do you have no shame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cheeks flushed, the sting of her words sharper than he&#39;d anticipated. &#34;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m asking for charity. I said I&#39;d pay you back-with interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;Do you think I need your interest?That&#39;s not the point.&#34; Of course, she didn&#39;t. He knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ve run out of options,&#34; he admitted. &#34;I don&#39;t know who else to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;And that led you to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold indifference was like a dagger to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really hate me that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about hate, Alexander. It&#39;s about moving on.There&#39;s no reason for us to stay connected anymore.We&#39;re not in the same world. Can&#39;t you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had ascended to a realm of unimaginable wealth and power, while Bennett Group teetered on the brink of collapse, unable to scrape together even ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They really were living in completely different worlds now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky grew darker eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold wind swept through the streets, carrying the first drops of rain. As the storm rolled in, Alexander stood alone,his despair as heavy as the weight of the falling night.</p>
