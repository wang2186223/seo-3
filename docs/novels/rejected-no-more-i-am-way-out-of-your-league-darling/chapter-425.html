                <p>Daniela held an unpeeled orange in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the turmoil within her, a restless energy clamoring to burst out and tear everything apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint scent of blood lingered in the air,which oddly excited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,a shadow fell before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could look up, a large hand took the orange from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Daniela caught a whiff of a subtle, masculine scent of pine, mingled with the sweet aroma of the orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A peeled segment of the fruit was presented to her, and without thinking, she accepted it. As she bit down,a burst of sweetness filled her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, Daniela found Cedric under the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of orange seemed to weave its way from her tongue to her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,&#34; Daniela called out in the silence of the villa, her eyes locking with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tilted his head slightly, responding with a soft, &#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you frightened?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A complex look crossed Cedric&#39;s eyes. He held his silence for a moment before drawing Daniela close. &#34;It breaks my heart to see you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then drifted into a deep sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned for Daniela&#39;s well-being, Nina asked Lilian,11|sDaniela going to be alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While watching television, Lillian responded, &#34;She&#39;s fine.&#34; Despite Lillian&#39;s reassurance, Nina remained doubtful. The trauma Daniela had endured was Immense,a burden challenging for anyone to bear. &#34;Should I check on her to make sure she&#39;s really okay?°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilian, without turning, replied, &#34;She&#39;s fine. A good night&#39;s sleep will help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina appeared worried, but Liflian continued, &#34;She&#39;s the most mentally tough person in our organization.Plus, she knew what she was getting into. She&#39;s used to dealing with shocks like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But understanding something intellectually and living through it are completely different,&#34; Nina said. &#34;It&#39;s one thing to know my family doesn&#39;t care about me, but it feels entirely different when they actually hurt me.And what do you mean by &#39;organization&#39;? Isn&#39;t Elite Lux a company? Why cal it an organization? And why say she&#39;s used to it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, still focused on the TV, answered in a flat tone, &#34;Just misspoke. She&#39;ll recover with some rest, and Cedric is there to look after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Lillian&#39;s reassurances, Nina remained skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when she saw Daniela descending the stairs, still groggy, she was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fir&lt;7e111Daniela responded, her hair flowing down her shoulders. She grinned at Josie in the kitchen and said, &#34;Josie, could I get two fried eggs for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina watched her, full of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone heal so quickly from emotional wounds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce had returned to the aesthetic clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug,having seen Daniela at a recent gathering, said anxiously, &#34;I need to win Daniela over, no matter what it takes,&#34; Recently,while making love to Joyce, Doug would call out Daniela&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much longer until we see results?&#34; Joyce asked the plastic surgeon, clearly frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she was intimate with Doug and he mentioned Daniela&#39;s name, she felt the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was eager to leave that situation behind as quickly as possible.</p>
