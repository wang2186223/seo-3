                <p>Katrina&#39;s greed was evident in every line of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She urged Caiden on relentlessly, her face contorting into something unsettling, her desperation tearing away any trace of composure or dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stared blankly at the woman before him,lost in deep thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer remained by the side, showing no urgency to push them along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lingered in hesitation, his mind clouded with doubt. After a prolonged pause, he spoke to Katrina.&#34;Maybe we should...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Katrina barked, her eyes flashing with venom as she glared at him. &#34;What do you mean,maybe? Why the hesitation now? What&#39;s there to think about? Don&#39;t tell me you still have feelings for Brylee! Remember, Caiden-Joyce and I are all you have now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lashed at him like a whip, leaving Caiden to press his lips together tightly in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even react, Katrina grabbed his hand and signed the contract herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gazed at the document, his signature glaring back at him. After a long pause, he exhaled a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela headed straight for her bed, totally exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was troubled. He stood vigilantly outside her door, watching over her. It wasn&#39;t long before Ryan and Lillian joined him, both clearly agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian seethed with fury. &#34;Caiden&#39;s a bastard! He knows exactly how to exploit Daniela&#39;s weaknesses,and he does it every time. He&#39;s despicable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s eyes were icy, his face dark and filled with barely contained anger. Cedric, overwhelmed by his frustration, reached into Ryan&#39;s pocket and pulled out a cigarette. He didn&#39;t bother lighting it; instead, he just held it between his fingers, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn&#39;t seem to quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was completely fed up with the people who kept draining Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that if she didn&#39;t have someone solidly backing her, these leeches would just keep coming back, trying to take everything they could from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sighed. &#34;This is Daniela&#39;s family issue, and it&#39;s not our place to interfere. But if it were Alexander, I&#39;d have smashed his head by now! Honestly, if Daniela had a real family to rely on, none of this would even be happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it casually, without thinking much of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Cedric suddenly turned to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Lillian blinked, momentarily confused. Then it dawned on her. Ryan straightened, finally understanding the direction this conversation was taking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s face brightened. &#34;That&#39;s it! Cedric, you should marry Daniela! I know it might sound a bit bold, but your family&#39;s not complicated-it&#39;s just you and your grandmother, right? No messy relatives or hidden agendas. And if you marry Daniela, you&#39;d have the right to handle all of Caiden&#39;s issues. As her husband, everything would be above board!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;husband&#34; rang in Cedric&#39;s mind, and his expression softened.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Husband...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s husband?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian both watched him expectantly,waiting for his answer. After a pause, Cedric spoke seriously. &#34;I&#39;ll do my best. I&#39;ll work hard to marry her as soon as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as the words left his lips, he knew this wasn&#39;t something he could rush. He didn&#39;t want to handle something so crucial with haste or carelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Cedric, every moment of their relationship mattered. The small, quiet moments where trust grew, the gradual deepening of their feelings, the meeting of families, and eventually, marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a journey he was determined to take with care and purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela deserved far more than a rushed decision made out of convenience or external pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was exceptional. She deserved nothing but the best, and Cedric was committed to making sure she got exactly that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;5% of the robotics company&#39;s shares?&#34; Joyce&#39;s face lit up in excitement as she looked at the contract. Unable to hold back, she wrapped her arms around Caiden, kissed his cheek, and laughed. &#34;I can&#39;t believe Daniela was so generous this time. Dad,what did you do to change her mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained silent. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to admit what had truly happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deal was sealed, and Katrina couldn&#39;t hide her joy. She patted Joyce&#39;s hand, saying, &#34;Sweetheart,your father put in so much effort. He begged Daniela for ages. They&#39;ve had a complete fallout over this.From now on, your father has no one but you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words held a subtle double meaning, directed at both Caiden and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce missed the implication. She simply nodded, flashing a bright, carefree smile. Gripping the share contract tightly, she skipped off to find Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief when he saw the contract. For a moment, he even questioned if it was real. &#34;Daniela gave you 5% of the shares? Just like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While 5% might not sound like a lot, given the market value of the robotics company, it was worth well over a hundred million dollars. And Daniela had just given it to Joyce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so odd about it?&#34; Joyce responded, her tone casual but with a touch of arrogance. &#34;No matter what problems Daniela has with the Harper family,she&#39;s still Dad&#39;s daughter. I&#39;m getting married; is it really so wrong for her to give me a little something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned. This wasn&#39;t just a little gift. Deep down, he couldn&#39;t believe Daniela would part with something so valuable without a deeper reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela still had any vulnerability regarding the Harper family, there was only one possibility-Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thought unsettled him. The idea that they might be exploiting a deceased woman&#39;s memory,squeezing out the last of her legacy&#39;s worth, was revolting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, however, was unfazed. &#34;Didn&#39;t Joyce say it herself? They&#39;re family. Stop overthinking this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wedding day arrived, Alexander&#39;s doubts lingered in his mind. The five percent shares filled Joyce with a newfound sense of assurance. At the wedding, she radiated pride. Her smile was wide and beaming as she referred to Daniela as her &#34;sister&#34; whenever she could, her voice soft and warm, as though their bond had always been flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the ceremony unfolded, Daniela&#39;s absence became more and more noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s enthusiasm slowly faded into worry. She pulled Caiden aside, her voice laced with concern.&#34;Dad, did you invite Daniela to my wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden couldn&#39;t bring himself to confess that he had knelt and begged Daniela for the shares or that Lillian had discarded the wedding invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he mustered a faint smile and answered,&#34;She&#39;s probably tied up with something.Maybe she&#39;ll show up later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything, Caiden held on to a sliver of hope. He told himself Daniela couldn&#39;t possibly be that harsh-she wouldn&#39;t sever their bond entirely. But as the ceremony drew to a close, Daniela&#39;s absence remained constant.</p>
