                <p>A restless fog hung over Daniela,her thoughts tangled and her sleep fitful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally blinked her eyes open, she found Cedric planted at her bedside, watching her with unwavering attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night had already fallen, wrapping the room in darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the nightstand, Daniela squinted at the clock-it was just past one in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For more than four hours, Cedric hadn&#39;t left her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fatigue painted his eyes red, the toll of sleeplessness written across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s ordeal hadn&#39;t left Daniela shaken so much as on edge; in truth, it was Cedric whose fear ran deepest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the blanket back, Daniela gave a quiet signal,inviting him. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated, blinking as he read the meaning in her gesture. &#34;Usually when you&#39;re this unsettled, you prefer to be alone, don&#39;t you? I&#39;ll stay here and keep watch instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded him-handsome in the dim light,worry etched into every line of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Daniela was simply a girl lost to the night,vulnerable and spooked by the storm. To Cedric, she seemed heartbreakingly fragile, as if she could crumble with the slightest touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy welled up in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not just anybody,&#34; Daniela whispered,voice soft and earnest. &#34;Please, come lie with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after hearing those words did Cedric rise and join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he realized he hadn&#39;t showered, he darted into the bathroom for a rapid rinse. Clean and refreshed, he slid into bed beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the thick darkness, her voice was soft but certain.&#34;Hold me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s arms found their way around her, pulling her gently into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lashes fluttered closed, her breath warm against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew closer, pressing her lips to his in a tender Cedric froze, unsure whether to respond. On any other night, her affection would have sent his heart soaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, caution ruled him. The events of the day lingered,and he worried she might still be fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but fear that the trauma might haunt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his hesitation, Daniela whispered, &#34;I won&#39;t let it get to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hold became firmer, wrapping her securely in his arms. Gradually, his breathing slowed, matching hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hours stretched on, silent and deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s resolve was clear-he would do everything in his power to erase Alexander&#39;s shadow from her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted no trace of Alexander&#39;s repulsive cruelty remaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His devotion poured out without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,exhaustion claimed Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric made sure to gently clean her up, tending to  every detail so she could rest in comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep slowly overtook Daniela. Her hand slipped limply onto Cedric&#39;s chest, her voice barely a whisper as she murmured, &#34;Let there be no hatred left here.I just want you to always be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Cedric straight in the heart,nearly undoing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, her first thought was for his happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet those cold-blooded people had dared to harm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently promised they would pay for every wound they inflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Neither Nikolas nor Damon managed a moment&#39;s rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic pushed Damon to pace the living room. &#34;This is a nightmare! Daniela&#39;s okay, isn&#39;t she? Please tell me nothing happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot on the sofa, Carol shot him a glare. &#34;If nothing had happened, would Cedric be mad? No matter what Daniela decides, your family isn&#39;t getting off the hook!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration colored Damon&#39;s face. &#34;That&#39;s not fair-it had nothing to do with us. Don&#39;t punish the innocent!&#34; But Carol wouldn&#39;t be swayed. Her anger lashed out at him. &#34;And yet your last name is still McCoy, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon could only stare, words failing him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, once proud of his flourishing business, now found himself drowning in shame, unable to imagine facing Daniela after what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men spent the long night downstairs, trapped under the weight of Carol&#39;s cold glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,meanwhile, worked her phone relentlessly,rallying allies and sounding alarms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry gnawed at Nikolas and Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the night, Carol made call after call-by sunrise, she&#39;d spoken to at least a hundred people,spreading word of the outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They openly declared that they wanted Alexander&#39;s and Hamilton&#39;s lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t forget Daniela&#39;s formidable reputation -she was a legend among mercenaries. If her people were truly unleashed now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would mean going to war with his own family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, Nikolas&#39; nerves had frayed to the breaking point, prompting him to dial Cedric in desperation Cedric answered coldly, &#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t slept all night. Once Daniela slipped into a deep rest, he left her side and made his way down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rushed to intercept him. &#34;I know Dad&#39;s to blame, but he&#39;s still our father. I&#39;m begging you for mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the plea left his lips, Nikolas couldn&#39;t help but notice the love bites scattered across Cedric&#39;s open collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tugged his collar higher and fastened the top button, his face shadowed and unreadable as midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for Carol&#39;s phone and addressed the anxious group, saying, &#34;No need for reinforcements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief passed over Nikolas and Damon,their tense shoulders finally relaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric&#39;s next words shattered their calm. &#34;I&#39;ll handle this myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit Nikolas like a bolt of lightning-Cedric wasn&#39;t just anyone; he was the Lone Wolf&#39;s leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bad. His father had provoked the wrong couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain struck the windows that day,heavy and relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his room, Cedric swapped out his clothes for a black ensemble, blending into the stormy gloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the hood over his head, he paused just long enough to tell Carol, &#34;I&#39;ll only be gone an hour. Make sure nothing happens here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a backward glance, he slipped out into the raging night, leaving only the retreating glow of his car&#39;s taillights to pierce the darkness</p>
