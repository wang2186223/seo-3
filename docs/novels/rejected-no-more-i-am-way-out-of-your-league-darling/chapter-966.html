                <p>Nothing in Daniela&#39;s posture suggested disagreement.With a slight tilt of her chin, she gestured for Hamilton to proceed. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of excitement lit up Hamilton&#39;s face. He couldn&#39;t remember the last time he felt this kind of confidence bubble up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to show Daniela what he was made of,he saw this as his chance to prove that his status in the McCoy family wasn&#39;t just empty talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Directing his attention to Josh, Hamilton didn&#39;t waste time.&#34;Josh,did Ethan give you thirty billion dollars?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One leg crossed over the other, Josh shot him a look full of smugness. &#34;That&#39;s right. He said it was for investment. Is that a problem for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to bite his tongue, Ethan blurted out, &#34;That&#39;s nonsense! I never agreed to invest in anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he even arrived, Josh had already guessed they would pester him with their dull questions. He retorted,&#34;Is that so? If you never planned on investing, then why did you give me the money? Were you overflowing with cash that you decided to hand it out for free?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ethan could argue, Josh continued,&#34;If it&#39;s a gift, I&#39;ll gladly take it. Thanks, Ethan. That&#39;s one hefty present.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief colored Hamilton&#39;s tone. &#34;A gift? Keep dreaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan snapped, &#34;You twisted my words. You said it was an investment, and I fell for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking, Josh seized the moment. &#34;So you admit it was for investment? Everyone here heard that,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost for words, Hamilton ended up glaring over his shoulder. &#34;Ethan, if you can&#39;t talk straight, just keep quiet.Stop making things worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan looked like he might break down any second.&#34;I&#39;m telling the truth! He tricked me, and now he won&#39;t own up to it. I can&#39;t take this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela settled into her chair with her eyes stretched wide as she took in the sight of Ethan, an adult man,being pressured until he practically shrank into the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not deny that the entire scene fascinated her more than she cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elbows propped on the table, she studied the unfolding scene with a faint, amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get one thing clear. Ethan never agreed to any investment,&#34; Hamilton said. &#34;Do you have any paperwork to prove it? Was there a signed contract?Without legal documents, this isn&#39;t a real investment.Now that he&#39;s changed his mind, you need to return everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tow, dismissive laugh slipped out as Josh pulled a contract from his folder and let it fall to the table with a slap. &#34;So you want a contract? Here it is. Honestly,I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so hung up on these little details You could just relax and let me make you all richer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh fixed his gaze on Ethan, tone suddenly turning almost wounded. &#34;Ethan, after everything I&#39;ve done for you, this is what I get? Now you&#39;re teaming up with outsiders to grill me? The money was in your hands,and you gave it to me willingly. You begged me to let you in on this, practically idolized me, and now you&#39;ve changed your mind. I&#39;d hand it back in a heartbeat, but it&#39;s all tied up in the business now. Here&#39;s what l suggest-leave the funds with me for a year. When the profits and dividends roll around, your share will be waiting. Sound fair? We&#39;re all on the same side, aren&#39;t we? You really think I&#39;d cheat you? Trust me,I don&#39;t even need your pocket change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh rose to his feet. &#34;So we are all clear now, right?Does anyone have something more to bring up? If not, I will be leaving. Funny. You dragged me all the way here over something so trivial when I was expecting a serious issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he finished, Josh landed a mock-friendly pat on Ethan&#39;s shoulder, grinning broadly. &#34;Just sit tight and watch.Soon enough,you&#39;ll be rolling in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utter disbelief showed on Ethan&#39;s face. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t understand how Josh managed to twist everything around so smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate for support, Ethan turned toward Hamilton,silently pleading for him to step in and take his side.</p>
