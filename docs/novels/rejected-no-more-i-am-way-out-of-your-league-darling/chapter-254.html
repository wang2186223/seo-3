                <p>Shirley&#39;s face blanched upon hearing the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always sensed something unusual about Daniela and Cedric&#39;s interaction, and now it seemed there was a deep bond between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager for answers, Shirley quickly sought out Katrina to discuss her concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re reading too much into it&#34; Katrina remarked assuredly while tending to her flowers. &#34;Their relationship is purely platonic. Consider how Daniela treats Ryan. She&#39;s kind to him as well. They couldn&#39;t be married. If there were, Daniela wouldn&#39;t keep it hidden. Why should she hide Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley wasn&#39;t entirely convinced by Katrina&#39;s reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen,&#34; Katrina added, &#34;Daniela is much like her mother-hard to understand, but deeply loyal once you get to know her. I was merely a servant, yet Brylee treated me like family. Some people genuinely go out of their way for those they value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This trust had enabled Katrina to marry Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there was anything official between them, given their prominence, it wouldn&#39;t remain a secret. They just share a close bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded, though her gaze drifted back upstairs, wondering about the allure of Daniela&#39;s room that kept Cedric returning so often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian shared her confusion. &#34;Something&#39;s really off,&#34; she commented to Ryan, who was seated on the floor,immersed in his coding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Ryan asked distractedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela and Cedric have been acting oddly lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Liflian explained, &#34;They&#39;re distant in public but seem close at home, watching TV together. I initially thought they might have quarreled, but Cedric spends hours In Daniela&#39;s room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, having stayed up all night working on a complex programming task, multitasked between coding and responding to Lifian without breaking his focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nudged Ryan, asking, &#34;What&#39;s going on with them? Are they fighting or getting closer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. &#34;No way, those two can&#39;t really fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they together then?&#34; Lilian speculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, Ryan shook his head. &#34;Daniela&#39;s not easy to win over. Cedric would need a decade at least to make any headway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric descended the stairs, overhearing the tail end of Ryan&#39;s remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, feigning irritation. &#34;What&#39;s this now? I&#39;m just trying to get some work done.Why bring me down? Do you really think I&#39;m that hopeless? Ten more years? How old do you think I&#39;ll be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian caught sight of Cedric and felt a familiar twinge. She whispered to Ryan,&#34;Did you see how Cedric just smiled? It&#39;s rare to see him smile that broadly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan,preoccupied with a remote meeting, didn&#39;t notice. He responded nonchalantly, &#34;Yeah, he&#39;s been smiling more often lately. It&#39;s not that unusual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sensed something amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a shower, Cedric was about to head upstairs to see Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he opened the door, Lillian&#39;s gaze followed every move. &#34;Heading upstairs again?&#34; she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric halted, then turned back, walking towards the living room instead. He casually picked up the remote.&#34;No, just planning to watch some TV.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian squinted, skeptical. &#34;Really? You seemed pretty set on going upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had initially wanted to go up but knew Daniela preferred to keep things discreet, turned to the television and responded cryptically, &#34;You must be imagining things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian frowned. &#34;I&#39;m not the one with illusions, Cedric. Just be careful with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled to himself, reflecting inwardly. He wasn&#39;t there to cause trouble. He was utterly enchanted by her.</p>
