                <p>Natalie ignored the rumors floating around online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was entirely focused on when Daniela would meet her end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as another week went by, Daniela remained very much alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you a scam artist?&#34; Natalie shouted angrily at Russell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could that be? You&#39;re thinking too much. We are professionals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie snapped back, &#34;Then why is Daniela still breathing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I forgot to tell you, the money you provided was just an initial payment.You need to send over another three million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was furious when she heard this. &#34;Another three million? Will your demands ever end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had known the cost would be so high, she might have considered handling Daniela&#39;s disposal herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three million is nothing. Daniela is the world&#39;s vealthiest woman worth billions. Surely vou aren&#39;t  short three million?&#34; Russell asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie rolled her eyes. She was running low on funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been so sure that Cealmaur would kill Daniela soon that she had been spending freely, even after selling her villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, she had sold her car, designer handbags, and jewelry, and now, she had nothing left to sell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had always been under Brylee&#39;s wing, and as Elyse&#39;s daughter, Natalie had never experienced the struggle of having no money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her desperate situation was driving her to the edge,and Natalie found herself wishing more than ever for Daniela&#39;s swift end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you requesting a loan from me?&#34; Daniela was amused by the idea when she heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wanted her dead, was out of funds, and was now approaching her for a loan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a clever plan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie thought that once she was gone, she wouldn&#39;t need to repay the loan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Natalie kept up her proud demeanor even while asking for money. &#34;I&#39;m running a bit low on funds.Could you lend me five million, Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed. She remembered Russell mentioning to Natalie that thev needed an additional three million. &#34;What could you possibly need all that money for?she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie tightened her lips. &#34;What I use the money for is my own business. I&#39;l pay you back at some point.You have so much money, a few million here and there shouldn&#39;t bother you. In fact, giving it to me wouldn&#39;t make a difference,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight smile. &#34;That&#39;s not quite true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie paused for a moment. &#34;What? Are you pretending to be poor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered. &#34;Not exactly. It&#39;s just that my family is very strict with money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was surprised.&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wore a concerned look. &#34;My husband doesn&#39;t allow unnecessary spending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie appeared irritated.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared in disbelief at Cedric, who had just entered the room. &#34;You&#39;re a grown man, and you dare to control my cousin&#39;s finances?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked over at Daniela, who quickly winked at him.He nodded.&#34;Yes, your cousin earns money well.but I need to manage it. With so many people competing for her attention, I need to ensure our security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was caught off guard by Cedric&#39;s sharp insight Daniela always appeared so strong, yet here she was,seemingly controlled by her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,Cedric,could you lend me five million?&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice became gentler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric opened his laptop and responded with politeness, &#34;Of course, we&#39;re family. A few million is nothing to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smiled broadly and nodded eagerly. &#34;So when will you send the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, eager to see Daniela out of the picture,continued, &#34;Cedric, with your large company,you could transfer the funds immediately,couldn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was thrilled. She was about to call the finance department when Cedric suddenly asked, &#34;What do you plan to offer as collateral?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s smile froze, and her grip on the phone tightened. She stared at Cedric, stunned. &#34;What?You need collateral?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at her calmly. &#34;Of course,loans require collateral.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was taken aback. &#34;But you just said we&#39;re family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded once more. &#34;Even among family,it&#39;s important to  keep things clear and manage them  properly. So, what can you provide as collateral?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The villa? Hmmm... It&#39;s sold. Your handbags? The one you&#39;re holding is second-hand, only worth a few thousand,not nearly enough. And jewelry...You don&#39;t have any left.&#34; Cedric looked up at Natalie. &#34;So, what will you use for collateral?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gasped. She felt Cedric wasn&#39;t truly planning to lend her the money; instead, he seemed to be using this as a chance to embarrass her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, won&#39;t you intervene?&#34; Natalie walked over to Daniela. &#34;We&#39;re cousins. I&#39;m definitely on your side.Honestly, you shouldn&#39;t let Cedric manage all your finances. Didn&#39;t you see the news yesterday? Cedric was involved with Joyce. How can you still entrust him with so much money? You need to be more careful.Women shouldn&#39;t trust men with their money;keep it yourself. Or better yet, let me handle it. I&#39;ve come across some excellentinvestment opportunities lately.Let me show them to you. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked seriously at Daniela. &#34;I mean it. Men can be dishonest. Don&#39;t trust them too much. Trust me instead. Hand the money over to me,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood up, left the room, and slammed the door behind him, the sound echoing throughout the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pointed at Cedric&#39;s vanishing figure and growled, &#34;Daniela, did you see that? Money really changes people. Cedric has the nerve to disrespect you like that! You need to teach him a lesson!&#34;</p>
