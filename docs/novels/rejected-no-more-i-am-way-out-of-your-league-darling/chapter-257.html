                <p>Joyce had never confessed it to anyone, but she had a peculiar fascination with hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very frst time she laid eyes on Cedric, her attention was immediately drawn to his hands/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were striking, long, and impeccably clean, with neatly trimmed nails that gleamed faintly under the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were a perfect blend of strength and elegance, exuding an effortless grace in every movement,no matter how mundane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,as she watched him gently stroke the head of a fluffy little puppy, a strange flutter stirred within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley had dared to approach him, so why shouldn&#39;t she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela momentarily out of the room to take a phone call, Joyce made her way downstairs and took a seat beside Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mindful of his reputation for valuing personal space, she maintained a polite distance-close enough to speak, yet far enough to avoid making him uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, do you like Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a question that didn&#39;t really require a response. Cedric&#39;s feelings for Daniela were practically common knowledge. But Joyce had her reasons for asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Predictably, Cedric stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shirley filled me in about you,&#34; Joyce pressed on. &#34;Cedric, let&#39;s make a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept his eyes glued to the television, showing no interest in her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, certain that Cedric was listening despite his indifference, carried on. &#34;I&#39;ll leave Alexander and marry you.Someone of your status will need to settle down eventually and have a family. I&#39;ll give you complete freedom, and all I ask is ten million a month. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric finally turned his head, giving Joyce a cool glance before chuckling. &#34;Not much to look at, but your ambitions sure are bold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced she had an edge, Joyce pushed further. &#34;No matter how close Daniela is to you, she&#39;s only interested in men. She&#39;s no help to you. You&#39;d be better off choosng me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked back into the room, catching the tail end of Joyce&#39;s statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, she asked, &#34;Choose who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was fully aware of how crucial it was to stay on Daniela&#39;s good side, especially now that Daniela was running the robotics company. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s nothing. We were just chatting about a TV show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rose to leave but leaned close to whisper to Cedric, &#34;Think it over,&#34; before making her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took her seat, but before she could say a word, Cedric gently tapped her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fingers were just about to intertwine when Lillian unexpectedly turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric reflexively straightened up as Lillian squinted at him and asked,&#34;Cedric, what were you doing just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t help but think that crowded places were definitely not for him. He couldn&#39;t even hold his wife&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, he shrugged it off and said casually, &#34;Just watching TV.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that point on, Lillian kept turning around, even going out of her way to physically separate them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clenched his jaw, narrowed his eyes, and glanced over at Ryan, who was engrossed in typing. &#34;Would you mind taking her out of here? I&#39;d really appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan let out a brief chuckle. &#34;Sorry, but I don&#39;t make the rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clicked his tongue in frustration. &#34;How can you be so spineless?&#34; Ryan looked up with a grin, his eyes clearly saying, &#34;Same goes for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Cedric remained in the living room, stretching his stay until midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He assumed Daniela had already turned in, yet Lillian was still wide awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liflian, why are you staring at me like that?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re acting oddly. Cedric, let me make something clear: loving someone doesn&#39;t mean you have to be with them. Do you understand what I mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric muttered,&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his exhaustion, he couldn&#39;t suppress a feeling of smugness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loving someone didn&#39;t equate to being with them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,he already had her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was his wife, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a whole month now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian fixed him with a steady stare, and Cedric, feeling cornered, quickly sent a message to Ryan, who was still in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan set aside his laptop, stood, and suggested, &#34;Lillian, come join me for a late-night snack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian declined with a curt,&#34;NO.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded nonchalantly.&#34;Oh, well, I&#39;ll go alone then. That place had great food last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned back in his chair with a faint smile playing on his lips. &#34;The restaurant owner is quite friendly,too. She&#39;s made a few hints about wanting to have a fling with Ryan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sprang to her feet and dashed after Ryan. Cedric chuckled to himself, turned off the TV, and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, though exhausted, hadn&#39;t quite drifted off. She could tell the instant Cedric entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gently lifted the blanket, taking care not to disturb her at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the warmth of the room seeped in, he reached out and pulled Daniela into his embrace.</p>
