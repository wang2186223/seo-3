                <p>Nikolas blinked, looking frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured Daniela had picked up a few of Cedric&#39;s bad habits. Wasn&#39;t the issue obvious? Still,she acted as if she had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas muttered, &#34;Carol refuses to talk to me. Can you give me some advice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused to take another bite of her fruit before glancing at him. &#34;You can&#39;t even handle one young woman and you&#39;re asking for help? That&#39;s pathetic.When Cedric came after me, he didn&#39;t need anyone&#39;s help. He&#39;s miles ahead of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a strained laugh.&#34;So you&#39;re just trying to brag now,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Obviously, yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sighed. &#34;Alright, fine. I&#39;m not as smooth as Cedric. But seriously, what am I supposed to do? No matter what I say, she ignores me. Yesterday, she even went out with someone else, like I&#39;m invisible. And I can&#39;t yell at her or get angry. How am I supposed to live like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly. &#34;I think I asked you about this before, and now I don&#39;t see any reason to bring it up again.&#34; Seeing how miserable Nikolas looked, she realized there was no point in pressing further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once questioned if he was truly serious and if this was what he really wanted, but back then, he had said he needed time to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing how desperate he was, she knew he had thought it through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, don&#39;t dismiss me like that! I regret it so much now,&#34; Nikolas said. &#34;I&#39;ve thought about it. I mean it.Please,just help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no patience for long-winded speeches.She simply smiled and noddedd. &#34;Carol might act cold,but she&#39;s soft at heart. Pestering her won&#39;t work. Use your brain,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked at her, confused.&#34;What do you mean...using my brain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;You&#39;re not even using it right now. Do I really have to spell it out? You just don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric walked downstairs and spotted Daniela in the dining room. He strolled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot him a desperate look. &#34;What does she mean by pestering won&#39;t work and I need to use my brain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose from her seat and carried her empty plate into the kitchen. Now only Cedric and Nikolas were left in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had no interest in this conversation. He had only come down to be near Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could leave, Nikolas grabbed his arm.&#34;Come on, we&#39;re family. Look at me-I&#39;m pathetic.Don&#39;t you feel sorry for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas drew in a deep breath. &#34;Fine. I&#39;m begging you.Will you help me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lowered his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, now curious, pressed on. &#34;Daniela must&#39;ve had plenty of men chasing her. How did you manage to win her? Share your secret!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; patience ran thin. &#34;Don&#39;t leave me hanging.Just tell me-how did you win her over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric finally spoke. &#34;There&#39;s one thing you need first.&#34;Nikolas stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has to be interested in you,&#34; Cedric said. &#34;If she likes you, she&#39;ll give you a chance. If not,you won&#39;t even get close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With someone like Daniela, if she had no interest, a man wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. But if she thought he was worth knowing, she&#39;d allow him the chance to speak with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric believed Carol was the same. Both Daniela and Carol only opened doors for those they genuinely cared about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Nikolas. &#34;Daniela&#39;s right. Pestering Carol won&#39;t work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded slightly, though confusion lingered.&#34;But I feel like she&#39;s actually letting me get closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what&#39;s stopping you? Go get her and marry her,&#34;Cedric said plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked. &#34;Is that really how it works?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a casual shrug. &#34;Worked for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela returned from the kitchen,Nikolas was gone. She stared at Cedric, disbelief all over her face. &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked calm. &#34;That&#39;s what I was thinking back then. Whether or not I stood a chance, I figured I&#39;d marry you the moment | could-just so you wouldn&#39;t regret it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was caught off guard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just didn&#39;t say yes right away,&#34; Cedric added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas grabbed Carol and pulled her outside. She had just finished peeling an apple when he dragged her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apple tumbled to the floor, rolling a few feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marry me!&#34; Nikolas blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes passed. Nikolas came back in. His face was bruised, his steps slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at him, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shuffled toward Daniela, looking absolutely defeated. &#34;Carol gave me a beating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tried not to laugh, but it was no use. She burst out, unable to stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked crushed. His eyes shifted toward Carol,who strolled in with her hands tucked into her pockets and a face cold as ice.</p>
