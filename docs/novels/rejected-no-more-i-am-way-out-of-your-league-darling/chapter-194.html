                <p>Katrina had no idea that someone was watching her in the shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt as though he was losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never felt so trapped in his life;ever since Daniela came back, it felt as though he was choking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All for the pursuit of money, he was being crushed beneath its heavy burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him that Daniela had no plans to run the company, and it was hemorrhaging money each day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The basic expenses were draining their funds rapidly,and Caiden experienced a gut-wrenching pain as he watched everything fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any hope of seeing dividends was gone. Worse still, Daniela refused to lend him any money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, as Joyce insisted on having caviar, Caiden,feeling completely powerless, managed a forced smile and stopped Alexander in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, you&#39;re going to marry Joyce. Shouldn&#39;t you pitch in to help cover some of her expenses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander deftly avoided the question, replying,&#34;Joyce and I aren&#39;t legally married yet. If people found out that the Bennett family is already paying her bills, they&#39;d laugh at you for not being able to support your own daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was momentarily stunned, then asked, &#34;So when are you planning on marrying Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, one less person in the house meant one less expense to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded coolly, &#34;Are you really that strapped for cash these days? Is that why you&#39;re so eager to marry off your daughter?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. How could you think that?&#34; Caiden quickly denied, his voice desperate. &#34;But you and Joyce have known each other for years, and your bondis strong. It would make sense to marry sooner. For young people like you, starting a family early is the way to go,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spoke casually. &#34;Joyce just had a baby,right? Let her rest for a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Alexander&#39;s tone seemed thoughtful,Caiden couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he didn&#39;t love Joyce at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Caiden was caught off guard, and before he could respond, Alexander had already gotten into his car and driven off, leaving Caiden to exhale a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling desperate, he turned to Cedric for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of inviting him home, he approached Cedric on his way back from work and suggested they talk at a cafe across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, do you like Daniela?&#34; Caiden asked without beating around the bush, driven to the edge by money troubles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric studied Caiden&#39;s calculating expression and didn&#39;t reply immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden didn&#39;t wait long, pressing on. &#34;Don&#39;t try to deny it. l&#39;ve noticed the way you look at Daniela.Cedric, winning her over won&#39;t be simple, will it?She&#39;s got a unique personality, and no ordinary approach will get through to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden let out a low chuckle. &#34;But I have a way.That&#39;s how I won over Daniela&#39;s mother all those years ago. She was a stunning beauty, with countless wealthy suitors, but she chose to marry me. Do you know why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smug look, Caiden raised his eyebrows and whispered, &#34;Because I have a secret weapon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes, his tone skeptical.&#34;And what exactly is this weapon?&#34; Caiden extended his hand, a sly smile creeping across his face. &#34;I can show you the way to Daniela&#39;s heart, locking in a lifetime of wealth and luxury. You could live just as I do, enjoying a life of comfort.Daniela&#39;s even better at making money than her mother. But I&#39;m not offering this for free. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s only fair to offer something in return? It wouldn&#39;t be right for me to give you advice without some kind of reward,would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression tightened, his brows knitting together. &#34;So, is this a business proposition you&#39;re making?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, don&#39;t put it like that. If you win Daniela over, we&#39;ll be family. I&#39;ll be your father-in-law. A little cash for me isn&#39;t a deal, it&#39;s just fairness. That&#39;s not something I&#39;d call a deal. Don&#39;t make it sound worse than it is.&#34;</p>
