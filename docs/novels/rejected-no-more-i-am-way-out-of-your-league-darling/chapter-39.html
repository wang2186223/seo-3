                <p>As soon as Katrina spoke Cedric&#39;s name, a chill ran down Caiden&#39;s spine, his body stiffening instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiar wave of dread and pressure flooded him,quickly sweeping away any thoughts or desires he&#39;d felt just moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did you just say?&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice was full of disbelief as he stared at Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina frowned, her confusion clear. &#34;Cedric,&#34; she said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stared at her as if she had lost her mind.&#34;Cedric? You want him as your son-in-law? Are you kidding? Do you even know who he is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Katrina asked, still bewildered.&#34;Isn&#39;t he the CEO of Phillips Group? The golden bachelor, one of the brightest new stars in the business world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured towards the TV, where Cedric&#39;s face appeared on the financial news. &#34;See, even the news says it-he&#39;s a standout among his peers. Handsome,decisive, a real up-and-comer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden closed his eyes for a moment, trying to steady himself. &#34;Yes, all of that&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina smiled, her gaze expectant as she waited for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But did you know he&#39;s only 25?&#34; Caiden asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina blinked, her confusion deepening. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with being 25?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? He&#39;s 25 and already a powerhouse.His personal fortune is worth tens of millions. Tell me,how many 25-year-olds in this country have done that? Most of his peers, the kids from rich families, are still wasting their parents&#39; money, racing cars, partying,and living aimlessly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Katrina exclaimed,gaining more confidence.&#34;It just proves how driven and capable he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden slapped his forehead in frustration. &#34;Yes, he&#39;s driven and skilled. But do you really think that&#39;s enough to make it in the ruthless business world?Cedric has no family to back him up or safety net to fall on. Everything he has, he fought hard for, enduring endless challenges. The business world is full of predators, yet he&#39;s not just surviving-he&#39;s thriving. Do you think he&#39;s someone who lets emotions affect his decisions? Joyce is sweet, but so incredibly naive. Her greatest pleasure is competing with Daniela over trivial nonsense. Do you think someone like that is cut out to be Cedric&#39;s wife? Just look at how cold he was to her yesterday. Cedric doesn&#39;t waste his time on people who lack substance or intelligence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was stunned by Caiden&#39;s words. &#34;What are you suggesting then? Are you saying Joyce is stupid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did Caiden think Joyce was lacking, but he didn&#39;t think much of Katrina either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first wife, Daniela&#39;s mother, had been too sharp,too calculating, and it had made him feel trapped.After her death, he had intentionally chosen someone like Katrina-a woman who knew how to flatter him and lean on him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His difficult relationship with Daniela? That was because she was just like her mother-too intelligent for her own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he believed he had been right all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s success now was proof of how smart she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce doesn&#39;t have a chance with Cedric. Even when it comes to looks, she&#39;s no competition for Daniela.If we&#39;re truly thinking of pairing one of our daughters with Cedric, Daniela would be the better choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela at least had the intelligence to match Cedric&#39;s ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s words were blunt, but they struck Katrina like a lightning bolt. So this was his true opinion of her and her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina walked out of the room, feeling stunned and her thoughts racing. When she stepped outside,she saw Joyce standing there, tears running down her cheeks.She had heard everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, don&#39;t cry. If your father won&#39;t help, we&#39;ll fight for our own happiness. We don&#39;t need anyone else. But don&#39;t forget about Alexander. He even left Daniela for you. He might be a good backup if things don&#39;t work out with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,hearing this, only felt more frustrated.&#34;Really?But it seems like the Bennett family isn&#39;t as interested in me anymore. The last fewN times I saw Richard, he was distant and cold. It felt like he didn&#39;t want me to be his future daughter-in-law anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands tightened into fists, and her eyes burned with anger. &#34;This is all Daniela&#39;s fault. If it weren&#39;t for her,I&#39;d be the one Alexander is crazy about. Cedric would pay attention to me too. It&#39;s all because of that horrible woman!&#34;</p>
