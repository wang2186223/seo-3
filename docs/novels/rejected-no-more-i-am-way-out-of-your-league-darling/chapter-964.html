                <p>Jules remained the final supporter standing beside Josh,although uneasiness gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh,don&#39;t you think you overdid it with Ethan earlier?Now that he&#39;s teamed up with Daniela, haven&#39;t we effectively gained another adversary?&#34; Jules aired his misgivings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An adversary? That&#39;s laughable,&#34; Josh scoffed,inhaling deeply from his cigarette and leisurely blowing the smoke into the air as it coiled around his head.His voice was edged with scorn. &#34;Daniela? She&#39;s no threat to me. She&#39;s a pregnant woman. Do you honestly think I can&#39;t take her down? Ethan&#39;s clearly gone insane. Are you slipping too? It puzzles me. The McCoy family controls half of Oiscoll&#39;s economy,and you&#39;re worried about someone from the outside like Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still feeling unsettled, Jules muttered, &#34;Regardless,Daniela is the world&#39;s richest individual. Josh, you should tread more carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh dismissed the warning with a flick of his hand.&#34;I can&#39;t fathom what&#39;s gotten into all of you. Daniela didn&#39;t rise on her own-Cedric handed her the throne. Now that she&#39;s carrying twins,what could she realistically pull off? Isn&#39;t Hamilton over at her place?I imagine he&#39;ll be the one sent to handle tomorrow&#39;s meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; brows furrowed at that. &#34;You took so much money from McCoy Group, and Hamilton&#39;s been furious ever since. If he ends up representing them at thenegotiationtable,haveyouplannedyourresponse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the rest, back when their father was alive,Hamilton had been delegated a substantial portion of the family&#39;s responsibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When disaster struck-including a serious financial recession-it was Hamilton who steered them clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the hasty division of the group&#39;s holdings,chaos erupted, with everyone scrambling for a bigger piece. Ironically, Hamilton was the one shortchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh had been merciless,catching the rest unprepared.Before Hamilton could act, McCoy Group had fractured. What Hamilton retained were remnants discarded by others. While the share values appeared equal on paper, his were the most illiquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s brazen confidence was the result of snatching a huge chunk of the company&#39;s resources.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Ethan&#39;s stake had also been seized, his arrogance had only deepened. &#34;What should I even say to Hamilton?&#34; Josh sneered,stretching out his legs in a leisurely sprawl.&#34;Father always said, &#39;The victors decide the narrative.&#39; Losers have no say. What, is he planning to sulk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Hamilton no importance whatsoever.Turning to Jules, he added, &#34;You&#39;ll see tomorrow. Whoever walks in for that meeting-Daniela or Hamilton-I&#39;ll grind them down. They don&#39;t even register on my radar. Like I always declare, here in Oiscoll, the McCoys dictate the game-or rather,I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the worried look on Jules&#39; face, Josh chuckled and said, &#34;Stick with me and you&#39;ll hit the jackpot. Mark my words-by the end of this year,your earnings will make Daniela&#39;s supporters envious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules finally managed to produce a grin. &#34;Much appreciated,Josh.You know I always follow your lead -show me the path to wealth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh exhaled more smoke and added with a sneer,&#34;Relax. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll obliterate them completely.Trying to take what I claimed? Not while I breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day would be the ultimate test of his power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Hamilton was visibly concerned. &#34;Should I confront Josh myself? You&#39;re expecting,Daniela.You don&#39;t stand a chance against him.&#34; After dinner, Daniela reclined on the couch,savoring slices of fruit Cedric had thoughtfully arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton and his brothers were seated nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on Daniela&#39;s slim limbs, baffled by how she remained so light despite eating constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had practically made it his mission to feed her five times daily, and although Daniela obliged to keep everyone at ease, her facial features had grown even more angular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was increasingly uneasy, thinking it might be time to consult several nutrition experts to reevaluate her intake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her closely,Hamilton insisted, &#34;Josh has size and bulk-you can&#39;t win. Let me handle things instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, calmly munching on fruit while half-focused on the television, retorted, &#34;And you believe you can defeat him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton,Brad, and Ethan were speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the awkward pause hanging in the air, Daniela glanced at the three men who had each been outmaneuvered by Josh. Their faces all carried the weight of failure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added innocently,&#34;I&#39;m just saying it as it is.&#34;  Hamilton let out a long breath. &#34;The truth cuts deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a solemn nod. &#34;True.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan chimed in, &#34;I fared the worst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tossed another watermelon cube into her mouth and asked Ethan casually, &#34;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m desperate to go. If we lose out, the deal&#39;s null anyway.Sixty billion means nothing to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan was nearly overcome with emotion. He turned to Hamilton. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t go-you already know you&#39;re not on Josh&#39;s level. Be honest with yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, now adept at interpreting Daniela&#39;s signals,swiftly added, &#34;We&#39;ll accompany you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hamilton was about to applaud Brad&#39;s solidarity,he heard him add, &#34;To back you up and cheer from the sidelines!&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t you feel weird? There&#39;s a huge crowd out here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danicla stayed where she was and gave a small laughh &#34;Notrealy Let the babies get a taste off thre mneall wworrlld carly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a laugh of his own. For a second the nerves slipped away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot him a glare as soon as Cedric laughed &#34;You think this is funny? This is serious busmess&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh caught that and let out a smug laugh &#34;Senous?Come on, Hamilton. What&#39;s so serous about thus? i&#39;m still your big brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton squinted, voice low. &#34;That nght? A brother who stabs his own family in the back? That&#39;s not the kind I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s jaw tensed the moment he laid eyes on Josih.He itched to end this once and for aill</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh smirked and gave him a slow pat on the shrovulldier.&#34;Ethan, Father always said brains matter most. You treat youm head like it&#39;s just for shrow. So tell me who&#39;s that on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan mearly llost comtrol</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh said flatly, &#34;T&#39;m not wasting time arguing I&#39;m hare to meet with Daniela&#34;</p>
