                <p>Huey&#39;s hand trembled, causing his phone to slip from his grip and crash to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurriedly scooped it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett entered the room with a smile that didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huey, where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34; he asked, his eyes flicking to the IV drip still steadily dispensing fluid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In such a rush? Ignoring your own health?&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice had an undertone of menace, and a glint of something dangerous flashed in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind outside slammed the hospital room door shut with a loud thud, making the air inside feel oppressively thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s body shook uncontrollably at Hackett&#39;s smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He retreated step by step as Hackett advanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Huey stumbled backward onto the bed. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of Hackett&#39;s hand slipping into his pocket, the outline of a knife handle subtly visible through the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s eyes widened in terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s scaring you, Huey? I&#39;m not here to hurt you.&#34; Hackett chuckled, the harsh white light throwing ghostly shadows across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vice seemed to tighten around Huey&#39;s heart, squeezing the breath from his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get home. Marcus is gone, and my son is distraught. He just called me in tears. I have to go back,&#34;Huey explained hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;s that so?&#34; Hackett raised an eyebrow. Huey nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett extended his hand towards Huey without blinking. &#34;Let&#39;s see your call log then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dry swallow, Huey handed over his phone. The most recent call confirmed his story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett returned the phone and pulled up a chair to sit opposite him. &#34;You&#39;ve always been the clever one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;ve been friends for over a decade. Surely, you know I&#39;ve always looked out for you, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s eyes darted with mixed feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smile widened. &#34;Some secrets are best kept buried. You&#39;re wise enough not to need reminding,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Huey opened his mouth to respond, Hackett cut him off.&#34;We all have families. We must think of them before acting on a whim, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s eyes shot open in alarm. &#34;What are you implying?&#34; he blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a friendly reminder to consider your loved ones before making any rash decisions,&#34; Hackett replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, weren&#39;t you heading home? I&#39;ll accompany you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela headed to the office in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could step inside, someone burst out from across thestreet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she unleashed a swift back kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,having seen someone dash out, intended to shield Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she resolved the situation so swiftly that he barely registered her movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood dumbfounded, not by Huey&#39;s loud cries, but by Daniela&#39;s swift kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gaped at his wife. &#34;You just...&#34; he stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked. It had been a reflex; Huey had emerged too suddenly for her to do anything but react. Cedric examined Daniela from head to toe.&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Daniela replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was utterly astounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, a delicate woman, had just sent a man flying back with a single kick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in the world was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught Cedric&#39;s bewildered look and quickly clarified,&#34;Inemergencies, the human body can unlock astonishing strength. That&#39;s why they say...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her voice so only Cedric could hear. &#34;Motherhood endows a woman with formidable power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared enlightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, nearby, shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gullibility seemed to know no bounds; he&#39;d believe any tall tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when Lillian thought she couldn&#39;t endure any more, Cedric added, &#34;Then I should have that power too!Fatherhood must endow a man with strength as well! You don&#39;t always have to fend for yourself. I was ready to intervene just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him with trust. &#34;Is that so? Then I&#39;ll count on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric laughed, nodding vigorously. &#34;You can always rely on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sat on the ground, struggling to rise, his mouth agape as he watched the couple&#39;s tender exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell!? Have you all forgotten I&#39;m lying here?&#34; Huey shouted, both irate and in pain. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve been waiting for you all night!&#34;</p>
