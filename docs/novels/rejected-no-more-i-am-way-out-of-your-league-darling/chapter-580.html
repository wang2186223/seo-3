                <p>Daniela paused, then raised her eyes to meet Lillian&#39;s. &#34;Elyse is dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded affirmatively. &#34;Nina is parking the car.We were at the police station this morning and saw the body. It was indeed Elyse. The police told us she was found by the river, discovered by an early morning fisherman who then reported it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina walked into the room and, seeing Daniela,offered a gentle smile. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m okay. I actually find the irony of how this ended quite hilarious. Elyse spent her life plotting against everyone, and now to die like this-it&#39;s like poetic justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Did the police have any idea who was responsible?&#34; Lillian shook her head in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina excused herself and went back to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela furrowed her brow, and Lillian suggested,&#34;Maybe it was Winslow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent again, then said, &#34;I didn&#39;t expect him to move so swiftly and decisively!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so sudden. Elyse had just reached out to him,and then Winslow took her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the rush?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it a deep, dark secret, or something else at play?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arranged a simple funeral for Elyse and quickly completed all necessary ceremonies. She had also finalized arrangements with an overseas school that was ready to accept Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nina was about to leave, she embraced Daniela.&#34;Take care of yourself, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane took off, carrying Nina far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning home, Daniela received a phone call.&#34;Natalie wants to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared intently at Daniela across the table.&#34;Did you have a hand in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a smile, &#34;Did you ask to see me just to ask that? It seems rather pointless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie retorted, &#34;Daniela, do you think you&#39;ve won?No! This isn&#39;t over. Danger lurks even in tranquility.You are destined for a tragic end like my mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Really? I&#39;m actually quite eager to see that. But I doubt you&#39;ll witness it.By the time you&#39;re released, the world will have changed beyond your recognition. Natalie, just stop fighting it. Nina is already studying abroad, living the life you&#39;ve always dreamed of, while you&#39;re going to rot here forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these words, Daniela stood up, her smile lingering. Overwhelmed with anger, Natalie stood up furiously,only to be forciboly seated again by the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shouts of anger dwindled as Daniela walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the sun shone brightly, and a gentle breeze rustled through the trees. Daniela looked up,pondering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the conclusion of it all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Alexander came to seek her out much sooner than she had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you give me one more month?&#34; Alexander begged, not ready to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed Daniela would agree to his request.However,Daniela shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? I don&#39;t understand! You don&#39;t need the association&#39;s resources, nor do you covet the president&#39;s chair. You desire nothing from them, so why target them? Daniela, it&#39;s not like you to hinder others&#39; business efforts or attack them. Why are you pursuing those eight individuals? If you tell me, as the current president of the association, I could even collaborate with you. I&#39;m here to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Alexander&#39;s true motive for visiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was prepared to forsake Bennett Group and relinquish his role as president of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was unwilling to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He aspired to be the man that Daniela favored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, he stood before Daniela, imploring her to reconsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even suggested, &#34;I don&#39;t need to divorce Cedric.I&#39;m quite open-minded. I&#39;ve been waiting for this day for a long time.&#34;</p>
