                <p>Bruno clung to the hope that the woman he had kept could shift the balance in his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hosted an extravagant banquet, expecting Cedric&#39;s presence, but the man never showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Bruno could come up with his next move, he was hit by a crushing defeat so absolute that any attempt to recover felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed incessantly with calls from the marketing department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Deleon, there&#39;s a major problem with our latest game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Deleon, hackers have cracked our newest release;pirated copies are flooding the market!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Deleon, our market share has plunged from 50%down to a mere 5%!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Deleon, our stock is on the verge of a historic crash!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Deleon...&#34; Bruno was drowning in dire reports. Yet he was completely incapable of stopping the downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, he stood at Elite Lux&#39;s entrance,the time since his last visit feeling like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories surfaced-his last visit, his harsh words towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,Daniela remained untouchably brilliant, while he teetered on the edge of financial ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno took a step towards the entrance of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard smirked. &#34;Apologies, Mr. Deleon.No appointment, no access.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno lifted his gaze to the towering building, tears carving paths down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hollow thud, he collapsed to his knees at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pride he once flaunted now mirrored the depth of his current desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bellowed, &#34;Cedric! Please! Just one more chance!I&#39;m begging you,Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers gathered, watching as Bruno slapped himself repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood seeped from his lips, dripping onto the  pavement in crimson streaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the heavens unleashed a torrential downpour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd scattered, leaving Bruno drenched and alone, his desperate cries slicing through the rain.&#34;Cedric! Please! See me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of approaching footsteps made Bruno&#39;s head snap up in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric loomed over him, an umbrella in hand, his gaze icy. &#34;Your chance is long gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno latched onto Cedric&#39;s leg, his voice trembling.&#34;I swear, I never meant to cross you! I shouldn&#39;t have insulted your wife. I get it now. Please, have mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric peered down at Bruno, whose outward submission was betrayed by his tightly balled fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lethal glint flickered in Cedric&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for men like Bruno, Daniela would have remained the radiant young woman she once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could never erase the image of Daniela, broken and despondent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl once as luminous as a princess had been dimmed by their greed. After all this time by his side, Daniela was only now relearning how to smile and truly unwind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People admired Daniela&#39;s strength, but who remembered that she was just twenty-four?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman in her prime, meant to bask in love and parental care, had instead carved out an empire with her own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world called her formidable, but all he felt was sorrow for her struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was so remarkable, so gentle, so full of life.Yet because of these people, she endured so much pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of hatred and fury brewed in Cedric&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent Bruno flying with a kick. &#34;Mercy doesn&#39;t exist in my world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno lifted his gaze, only to meet Cedric&#39;s unyielding,icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, why? Why are you doing this to me? I don&#39;t understand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips curled into a cold, indifferent smile.&#34;Because you had it coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno stumbled back to the commerce association, a  mere shell of the man he once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the conference room, the remaining seven members were already gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes flickered with astonishment-some surprised, some fearful, others indifferent to his downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett sighed.&#34;Bruno,you got too careless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest nodded in silent agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey smirked. &#34;If you ask me, your plan was weak.Otherwise,how could you fall so completely, with no way to fight back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley nodded. &#34;You should&#39;ve secured the shareholders from the beginning. Now, you&#39;ve lost their trust and control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno scanned the room-each of them speaking as though they bore no responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw his head back and laughed a loud, unhinged laugh. He clutched his stomach, pointing at them,laughing until tears rolled down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett frowned. &#34;Bruno, have you lost it? It&#39;s just one defeat. Is it really that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno stood, wiping away his tears. &#34;Is it worth it? Easy for you to say when you&#39;re not the one suffering-but  don&#39;t worry, your turn is coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Bruno turned and strode toward the exit.&#34;Let&#39;s see if you stay this composed when it&#39;s your head on the chopping block.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached the door, he paused and turned back. His sharp gaze locked onto Hackett&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You yes, you. You orchestrated Brylee&#39;s death. Just wait. Daniela will come for you! Ha-ha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s crazed laughter echoed through the halls of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment ago, the room had been full of chatter and amusement; now, everyone sat frozen, their smiles erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a single thought consumed them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would be next?</p>
