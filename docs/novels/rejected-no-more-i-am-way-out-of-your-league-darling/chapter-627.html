                <p>Cedric&#39;s mood was sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormned out, shooting a fierce glare at the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed with irritation, the doctor countered loudly, &#34;Cedric, how can you look at me like that?We&#39;ve shared more than a decade of friendship. And yet,you&#39;re throwing daggers at me because of one remark? Remember, you were the one who sought my advice.Moreover, Daniela did say she was okay with that, but she didn&#39;t attribute it sorely to you. How could you misinterpret her words so badly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was icy, his features hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of his doctor&#39;s pointed words felt like a sharp stab,leaving him gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Cedric&#39;s look of betrayal, the doctor exhaled a weary sigh. &#34;Fine. I concede,I was mistaken,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s frustration mounted, heavy like a stone in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fit of impulse, he went to Elite Lux, compelled to ask Daniela about it. But upon his arrival, he paused abruptly and pulled back. He cast his eyes downward in silence, examining his injured leg, his brow furrowed in evident frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then instructed the driver to take him back to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sullen face, he told the doctor, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say before increasing the intensity of rehabilitation would speed up recovery? Let&#39;s doit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor regarded Cedric with a teasing smile &#34;Incredible! Daniela really has a hold on you. I&#39;ve been pestering you for ages, and you wouldn&#39;t budge. Yet,one offhand comment from her, and you&#39;re all in.You&#39;re really under her spell,Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Daniela had convened a meeting to outline her latest initiatives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had finalized her latest fashion designs and was gearing up to launch a worldwide fashion event to mark her comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed off the remaining organizational duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, when she was back in her office to take a brief respite, Carol knocked and stepped inside.&#34;Daniela,someone is here to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina appeared at the doorway. &#34;I&#39;m back, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having honed her acting skills internationally, Nina had clinched many acclaimed roles, now a celebrated figure in the entertainment sphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I miss your show? I have a whole circle of friends in the industry who are eager to join in celebrating your grand return. Plus, having studied marketing overseas, I&#39;mwell-equipped to ensure your show truly highlights the brilliance of Elite Lux on a global stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a smile in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware that Nina wasn&#39;t prone to exaggeration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since stepping into the limelight of the entertainment sector, Nina had not only launched her own studio with Daniela&#39;s financial support but had also signed a plethora of stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her acumen had even caused ripples in international economic arenas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t just dismiss my gratitude. Without you, I&#39;d be nowhere. I might not have Ryan&#39;s or Lillian&#39;s prowess, but I promise to strive tirelessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears tinged Nina&#39;s eyes as she continued,&#34;When everyone else turned their back on me,you offered me a sanctuary and shaped my future. WVithout your support now, I&#39;d be utterly lost.&#34; Daniela nodded. &#34;Alright, then. Proceed to the marketing department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hurried downstairs, her steps light with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Daniela&#39;s mentorship, she had become a force to be reckoned with, both sharp and resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a short span, her presence had significantly boosted the marketing department&#39;s performance,much to Daniela&#39;s relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the celebrated day of Elite Lux&#39;s grand fashion show, a parade of top-tier models from all corners of the globe took the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience was spellbound by a spectacle of fashion unlike any before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That momentous day, as onlookers gazed upon the breathtaking designs, it was crystal clear that Daniela,the venerable president of Elite Lux, had preserved her renowned creative spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years might have flown by, yet Daniela&#39;s artistic prowess and visionary outlook on style continued to stand in a league of its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That illustrious evening, Daniela infused Elite Lux with renewed vigor, securing its place once more at the pinnacle of aristocratic fashion trends. She had woven yet another chapter into her enduring legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fashion industry was electrified with chatter and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Globally,recognition for Daniela&#39;s ingenuity in design resurfaced with vigor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the quiet of the aftermath, Daniela found solitude in her office within Elite Lux, her hand clasping a glass of water, her eyes betraying a distant,vacant stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol rapped softly on the door before slipping inside,leaning in, and whispered, &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s an urgent update-Natalie and Winslow are on the run from jail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela uttered a nonchalant, &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the surface, unseen forces were once again in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This subtle disturbance signaled that she was inching ever closer to uncovering a hidden truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol momentarily stepped away, then reappeared holding a bottle of wine. &#34;Alexander sent this to you,saying he wants to celebrate with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela was short on time. She walked into the lounge and changed into her sharp black attire. As she made for the door, she said, &#34;I&#39;m on my way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol followed her. &#34;Wait,Daniela. Ced...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trailed off as the elevator doors whisked closed before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was left staring blankly at the closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rooted to the spot, she whispered to herself, &#34;Cedric told me about the exceptional salmon they have today. He&#39;s whipped up some splendid sushi that he&#39;s bringing up shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Nina approached, her arms overflowing with gifts. &#34;Many gentlemen are all keen to share a meal with Danela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s unmatched allure in the business world was evident once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The socialites of Olisvine were scrambling to link their fortunes with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she was a married woman, it seemed inconsequential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, wasn&#39;t she grappling with amnesia? And with no children to speak of, her union with Cedric was on shaky ground. The most eligible bachelors in the city were watching keenly,ready to make their advances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexander sensed the impending challenge.</p>
