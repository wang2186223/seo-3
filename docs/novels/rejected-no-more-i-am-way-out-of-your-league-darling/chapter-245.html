                <p>It was obvious Cedric had no interest in Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s enthusiasm quickly faded, while Shirley stared at the closed door, her eyes reflecting deep thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt, let me try again,&#34; said Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Katrina looked up at Shirley with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s eyes shone with a sparkle, and a shy expression settled on her face, making her look just like a young girl experiencing the sweetness of first love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gave a firm nod. &#34;Alright, stay at home. Let me tell you, a woman can easily capture a man&#39;s heart if she makes thefirst move. You must be proactive, understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley responded with a nod. &#34;I understand. Don&#39;t worry, I feel confident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face lit up with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden observed silently, his patience tested once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really teaching her niece how to seduce a man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina would stop at nothing for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina caught the sneer in Caiden&#39;s gaze and scoffed, &#34;When Brylee was alive, didn&#39;t you flirt with me as well? Men often let their desires make their decisions and none are any good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his knowledge of Katrina&#39;s character, Caiden was shocked by her blunt words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You used to praise me, calling me elegant and composed, a true gentleman. How can you speak like this now? You told me your ex-husband abused you when he was drunk, and I felt sympathy for you. After Brylee&#39;s funeral, I married you, promising never to let you suffer. And now, you&#39;re telling me that I&#39;m just like those awful men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a deep pain in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Katrina looked at Caiden with hatred and exclaimed, &#34;Caiden, why pretend to be so affectionate?If you were truly devoted, you wouldn&#39;t have cheated with me. By that sense, you&#39;re worse than those other men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The illusion was completely destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face turned pale with rage, his body trembling. What he had believed to be love was nothing but a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fsts clenched tightly, he gave a bitter, trembling laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! You really are something,&#34; Caiden said, his expression filled with anger. &#34;Katrina, l&#39;ve finally seen your true colors.&#34;@</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina appeared unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody enjoyed serving others, especially not fora lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that Caiden&#39;s declared love for her was merely a search for the dominance he could not find with Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she pleased him, he was more than happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she displeased him, he would not hesitate to show his dissatisfaction through anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that what they called love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was supposed to be love, she wanted no part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Joyce was married, what was there to be afraid of?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out an insulting laugh, not bothering to glance at Caiden again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lowered his head, elbows resting on his knees, and ran his hand through his hair, overwhelmed by frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he been so blind to see Katrina for the heartless woman she truly was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even cut ties with Daniela because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone in the quiet, empty living room, Caiden cried with regret in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Caiden was absorbed by his regrets, Daniela&#39;s robotics company had made another remarkable breakthrough in the industry, achieving a worth of over a hundred billion dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company threw a grand celebration banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce entered the venue, she saw Daniela on stage, gracefully holding her dress while delivering a speech. Cedric was by her side, holding a glass of water, his eyes sparkling with pride as he watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes stayed on Cedric for an extended moment before she turned her gaze to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression was calm, yet Joyce sensed he must be feeling regret deep inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked radiant and extremely competent, her successes now out of Alexander&#39;s league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost all interest in Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on this, Joyce let out a soft laugh. She had once felt superior to Daniela because she stole Alexander from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Daniela had moved on to Cedric, who clearly surpassed Alexander in every way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared she was the one whó had truly lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm expression, Joyce brought her glass to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Daniela&#39;s speech, the crowd burst into applause. Joyce&#39;s eyes returned to Cedric, his face bright with happiness and pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It might have been her imagination, but Joyce felt that tonight, Daniela seemed closer to Cedric than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped down from the stage, she even extended her hand to Cedric. This was different from her usual self. Daniela had always been as independent as a lone wolf, always detached and unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced at the person next to her, a smile tinged with sarcasm on her face. &#34;Don&#39;t bother watching. I bet they&#39;ll end up together soon, if they aren&#39;t already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent, finishing his wine in a single, heavy swallow.</p>
