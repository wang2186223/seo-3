                <p>When people know each other too well, they also know where to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; weakness had always been his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he went to Hackett&#39;s home as he was told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Hackett arrived at the hospital bright and early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright smile, he walked into the ward carrying Huey&#39;s favorite dish and a fresh bouquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling any better today, Huey? You&#39;re still looking pale! You need proper rest, or your mind will start playing tricks on you,&#34; Hackett said, arranging the flowers in a vase before turning to meet Huey&#39;s sharp gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were cold, silent, and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My head is clear,&#34; Huey said, his ghostly pale face fixed on Hackett. &#34;I remember every detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett felt a flicker of murderous intent rise within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he kept his smile intact. &#34;Is that so? That&#39;s a relief. Huey, you have to set the record straight for me.People are accusing me unfairly! Can you believe Marcus and the others think I let go of your hand on purpose? It was Cedric-he shoved my arm; that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t hold on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett grinned, but Huey simply stared back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years, Huey realized he might have never truly known Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smile slowly faded, replaced by a chilling indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers brushed against the military knife in his pocket. One stab to the chest-it would all be over. No one would ever know. His face blank, Hackett took slow, deliberate steps towards Huey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett, I was just joking!&#34; Huey burst into laughter. &#34;Look at your face-you went pale. How could I ever doubt you? You&#39;re my closest friend! I have complete faith in you. I&#39;m not a fool; I know who truly has my back. Hackett, I&#39;m sure this was Cedric&#39;s trick, making it seem like he was the one who saved me. I was completely caught off guard. Cedric&#39;s plotting runs deep! It&#39;s no surprise we can&#39;t stand a chance against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett stayed silent, studying Huey intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey patted his chest. &#34;Man, that was terrifying. Bet you were scared too, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett didn&#39;t loosen his grip on the knife until Farley and the others burst through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been standing outside for a bit,&#34; Farley said with a frown. &#34;Huey, are you sure it was Cedric who tried to hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey shot Hackett a glance before nodding. &#34;Of course! Hackett would never hurt me. I saw it clearly-it was Cedric who knocked Hackett&#39;s hand away. I was left grasping at thin air. For a second, I thought I was done for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s expression darkened: &#34;If that&#39;s true, we can&#39;t just let it slide. We need to confront Cedric. Hetried to kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Farley and the others turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey held up a hand. &#34;Let it go. We don&#39;t have the advantage here. We barged into Elite Lux, looking for trouble. Cedric is obsessed with Daniela. Of course, he&#39;d protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley clenched his jaw. &#34;Defending her is one thing, but he couldn&#39;t just try to kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett, let&#39;s go confront Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley and the group dragged Hackett along with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sat still, eyes locked on Hackett&#39;s retreating figure, catching the subtle movement as Hackett finally let go of whatever he&#39;d been gripping in his pocket.</p>
