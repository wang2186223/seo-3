                <p>Bathed in the soft light, Cedric&#39;s smile was gentle.His eyes locked on Daniela&#39;s, he murmured, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the entryway, Lillian and Ryan came to a sudden halt. Moments later, they shared a glance, quickly covered each other&#39;s eyes, and sidestepped away in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Lillian murmured, &#34;What&#39;s the story with Daniela? Does she not feel love, or does she simply choose not to, or is she just clueless about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, typically a man of few words and a devoted admirer of Daniela, paused silently. He then leaned in, his gaze sharpening with an intensity rarely seen.&#34;I&#39;m not sure. But I think Daniela was flirting with Cedric just now. Did you catch that scene earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still shaken, Ryan made wild gestures. &#34;She just covered Cedric&#39;s ears. And his cheeks turned red!Can you believe it? And yet she says she doesn&#39;t know anything about love? If she can soften Cedric,the famously unshakable, there&#39;s nothing she can&#39;t do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was quick to agree. &#34;Exactly! She&#39;s clueless about the effect she has! Imagine if she tried that on Alexander. He&#39;d be overwhelmed. She&#39;s in a league of her own. An absolute master at this. Her charm is undeniable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Alexander was on his way to get water from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he opened the door, the chatter from below reached his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand stiffened on the doorknob, his face clouding over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought Cedric was fooled by Daniela&#39;s tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He himself wouldn&#39;t be duped so easily. Nor did he have any interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he lingered in the doorway, tightly gripping his glass, hanging on to their every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian returned upstairs later, she noticed Cedric&#39;s ears still bore a flush of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, she leaned on Daniela&#39;s door, took a deep drink of water, and asked, &#34;Daniela, can I ask something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, stretched out on the floor working on the puzzle, seemed as peaceful and unfazed as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched her closely, searching for any hint of emotion. But there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; Daniela murmured without looking up.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the spacious, quiet room, her voice took on an almost surreal echo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing briefly, Lillian finally said, &#34;Did you ever treat Alexander the way you did Cedric just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped, a puzzle piece pinched between her fingers. She straightened up and turned to Lillian,her face full of confusion. &#34;How exactly?&#34; Lillian covered her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shake of her head, Daniela responded, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pressed further. &#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pondering for a moment, Daniela tilted her head,her brow creased in contemplation. &#34;Why would l?Alexander didn&#39;t require that from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really that he didn&#39;t need it, or you didn&#39;t want to provide it?&#34; Lillian asked. &#34;Consider this. Had Alexander been in Cedric&#39;s situation just now, would you have offered him the same comfort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused to think, then said again, &#34;NNo. That&#39;s not how Alexander operates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why then, did you comfort Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he looked sad just now,&#34; she admitted.It was as if something precious to him had been hurt.In his eyes, she had noticed a momentary, hidden hint of sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian went on. &#34;And concerning Alexander...&#34; &#34;Lillian, you constantly mention Alexander,&#34; Daniela retorted sharply, crossing her legs. &#34;He&#39;s not suitable for you. He&#39;s cold, manipulative, and obsessed with profit. He&#39;s involved with Joyce. Although we&#39;re financially stable and could manipulate him with money, I would never recommend someone like him as a partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attempts had taught her well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was simply too distant, too gloomy, and too inconsistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not a viable candidate for marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Lillian blinked in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, who had been casually leaning against the railing,looked equally astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Lillian exclaimed, throwing her hands up, &#34;When will you apply that brilliant business acumen to other areas of life? You&#39;re always so logical and strategic at work. Yet, with personal matters? How can all your genius just vanish so completely?&#34;</p>
