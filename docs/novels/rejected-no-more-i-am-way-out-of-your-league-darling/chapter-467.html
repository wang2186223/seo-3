                <p>Natalie stepped into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stepped out, her face etched with distress. The reporters outside exchanged puzzled glances.confused as to why she was the only one to appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Natalie? Can we go in now?&#34; one of them ásked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse masked her irritation with a practiced smile.&#34;They just have a few matters to settle. It won&#39;t be long. Why don&#39;t we wait a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seasoned journalists immediately caught the underlying message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few newcomers remained oblivious. &#34;How long is this going to take? Is Natalie in there alone with Linden? That guy gives off sleazy vibes. Are you really okay leaving your daughter alone with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like an ill-timed joke, and an awkward silence followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of embarrassment rippled through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The younger reporters, initially confused, understood why Natalie had been left alone inside. On the surface, everyone appeared composed,but inside,they were reeling in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Elyse really letting her daughter be taken advantage of by someone so unreliable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scandals of the wealthy never failed to be shocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stepped out of the shower, steam curling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was already sprawled across the bed, his shirt gone, his grin lazy and predatory as his gaze roamed over Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I fell for you from the moment I saw you in college. But you never even looked my way. To me,you were like a star, distant and untouchable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Linden pulled Natalie towards him with his stubby hands, yanked away her towel and ran his hands over her wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gasped, becoming aroused. Linden let out a smug snort. &#34;See? You act like you don&#39;t want this,but your body tells a different story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s body quivered with embarrassment. Shame burned through her, yet she couldn&#39;t resist the expert way Linden touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered as Linden pressed her beneath himn,her breath hitching as he lowered his head. A helpless moan slipped from her lips, mortifying her to the core. If only the earth would open up and swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was no stranger to the darkest corners of indulgence. Against his unyielding intensity, Natalie stood no chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the room,Elyse stood stiffly by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep an eye on Daniela, he had booked this particular suite, which was not soundproof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with Linden&#39;s crude words and Natalie&#39;s muffled sounds seeping through the walls, a surge of fury twisted in Elyse&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter, Natalie, as delicate as a rose, was being handled by that beast,Linden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice interrupted Elyse&#39;s spiraling thoughts.&#34;Excuse me.&#34; A group of uniformed officers approached, their expressions stern as they showed their badges.&#34;What&#39;s going on in here?&#34; one of them asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stiffened.&#34;Well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers moved to push open the door but panic flared in Elyse&#39;s eyes as she quickly stepped in their way.&#34;You can&#39;t go in now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they stormed in now, the press would have a field day. If they caught Natalie in such a compromising position with Linden in bed together, how would she ever recover from the humiliation let alone faco anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers exchanged glances, unconvinced at Elyse&#39;s troubled expression. One knocked firmly on the door. A man&#39;s restrained voice called from inside.&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood frozen, utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police officers shoved the door open, and to Elyse&#39;s shock, it wasn&#39;t even locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers stepped inside, badges raised. &#34;Hello, sir.we&#39;ve received a report of illegal sexual activity here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters swarmed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras flashed, capturing the disheveled room, the charged atmosphere, and the two naked exposed figures frozen by the bed one in front of the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s hand was still on Natalie&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was happening too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hadn&#39;t fully registered what was happening before the shutter clicks became deafening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headlines practically wrote themselves. How had a girl once known for her innocence ended up here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The images of Linden and Natalie spread like wildfire that day Natalie never imagined things would turn out this way By the time Natalie understood the gravity of it,it was already too late, the reporters capturing every damning moment in rapid succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a strangled scream. yanking the sheet and using it to cover herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there were too many reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More and more pushed their way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse realized something was wrong-she hadn&#39;t called for this many people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to intervene, a familiar voice cut through the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,well,well. What do we have here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse squinted,taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gripped the thin fabric tightly around herself,her gaze snapping towards the source of the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd instinctively parted, making way for the newcomer.</p>
