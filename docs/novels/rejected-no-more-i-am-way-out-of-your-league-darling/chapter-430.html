                <p>The following morning, as Daniela began her workday, her phone rang with a call from Hurst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was by the doorway, appearing to keep busy, yet her focus was entirely on Daniela as she listened in with keen interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was aware but remained unfazed, keeping her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered the call with,a simple, &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, will you be coming by today?&#34; Hurst asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden says he&#39;ll take his own life if you don&#39;t show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Natalie&#39;s actions halted, her expression showing more concern than Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just ignore him,&#34; Daniela replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden then became franticon the line. &#34;Daniela! I am your father. How can you just let me die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, uninterested, ended the call abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Daniela&#39;s composed demeanor, Natalie silently judged her as cold-hearted, especially towards her own father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face took on a thoughtful expression as she pondered what Daniela&#39;s vulnerability might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Danieļa, what was that about just now?&#34; Natalie asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Daniela leaned back and flashed a knowing half-smile. &#34;Didn&#39;t you hear it all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie offered. a sheepish smile in return. She had encountered many sly individuals, but Daniela&#39;s blunt honesty was unfamiliar to her. &#34;Have you confined Caiden?&#34; Daniela&#39;s smile broadened. &#34;He&#39;s sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of illness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly raised her eyes, her relaxed demeanor masking an underlying threat, reminiscent of a lion ready to pounce. &#34;I&#39;m visiting him after work. Will you join me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was visibly surprised. &#34;May I come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was baffled by Daniela&#39;s frankness. How could she discuss such matters so openly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, or perhaps you&#39;d like to bring your mother along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been anxious about how to involve Elyse, but Daniela had effortlessly opened the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just days earlier, news of Caiden&#39;s illness had taken them by surprise. Unable to glean details from Nina,they wondered if Daniela had placed Caiden under house arrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, what could Daniela&#39;s motives possibly be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Daniela find out that Brylee&#39;s death was a murder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed illogical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Katrina&#39;s death, that</p>
