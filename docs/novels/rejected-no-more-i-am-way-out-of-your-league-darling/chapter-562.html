                <p>The vehicle raced down the winding road, its occupants gripped by a collective unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hours on the road, they finally reached the Bennett family&#39;s estate at three in the morning and rapped urgently on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Alexander appeared,shock rippled through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had anticipated such an uncanny resemblance to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it possible for someone to be his near-perfect double?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, they gawked at Alexander before hurriedly settling into their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Hackett had encountered Alexander before,the resemblance still unsettled him-but he had no time to dwell on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly blurted out, &#34;Alexander, you&#39;re about to take over as president. What&#39;s our next move? How did the tide turn in Cedric&#39;s favor? Have you seen the online chatter? People are actually sympathizing with  him! What&#39;s our plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, clearly on edge, chimed in, &#34;If we don&#39;t figure this out before ten, our stock prices could take a catastrophic hit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; chest tightened. &#34;If the stock crashes again,I&#39;d rather jump off the building! Mly company won&#39;t survive another blow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander,clad in an impeccably tailored designer suit,sat in their midst. &#34;So, are you all finally ready to accept me as president?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, they all nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, the presidency was the least of their concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If their businesses collapsed, titles wouldn&#39;t matter-they&#39;d have nothing left to fight over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As everyone nodded, Alexander caught the fleeting trace of reluctance in Hackett&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft chuckle,Alexander said, &#34;If you recognize me as your leader, I&#39;ll lend a hand. If not, I see no reason to bother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His piercing gaze lingered on Hackett as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno tugged at Hackett&#39;s sleeve and whispered urgently, &#34;Say something! The presidency is irrelevant now. Our survival is at stake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the group murmured in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett hastily complied, &#34;I never opposed it.Alexander, you&#39;re in charge. I have no complaints.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander inclined his head. &#34;Good. Then I&#39;ll take care of Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hadn&#39;t expected that, despite the enormity of the situation, Cedric had stayed silent and still turned the tide in his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The business world now praised him for pulling off one of the most masterful PR maneuvers in history,effortlessly turning a disaster into a victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, an official statement was released by the commerce association&#39;s account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Owing to Hackett Graves&#39; advanced age and his inability to continue leading the association, the presidency is hereby transferred to Alexander Bennett of Bennett Group. The association is optimistic that under his leadership, it wil better serve its members.To mark this transition, VIP membership channels are now open, with entry and first-year fees waived.Additionally, members with notable contributions will not only gain access to premium business resources but will also receive complimentary support to elevate their enterprises to billion-dollar valuations.&#34; The announcement sent shockwaves through the business world, igniting a flurry of debate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander Bennett? How did he end up as the association&#39;s president?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you heard? Since Bennett Group merged with the Fairburne Group, they&#39;ve been raking in wealth,landing a spot on the world&#39;s rich list. Richard is grinning from ear to ear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Alexander really become that powerful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about his abilities; it&#39;s about his marriages.One ex-wife is the richest person in the world, and the other left him a massive fortune. Say what you want,but Alexander sure knows how to pick them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that Alexander is president, do you think Daniela will join the association?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wealthiest person on the planet, Daniela&#39;s business instincts were second to none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on Elite Lux, waiting for their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors swirled that a powerful tycoon had secretly struck a deal with the association. Given their towering status in the business world, their identity remained undisclosed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, speculation pointed straight to Daniela. While anticipation mounted, the association&#39;s official account subtly fueled the fire by liking a comment on Elite Lux&#39;s official post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the public was convinced-Daniela had joined the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, businesses were clamoring to secure a membership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association&#39;s eight members marveled at the frenzy-seven of them couldn&#39;t help but give Alexander an approving thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander&#39;s influence is remarkable! Who knew being Daniela&#39;s ex-husband would be such an asset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks to this announcement, nearly every major business in the country is scrambling to sign up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their rush, no one seemed to notice the tiny line of text tucked away at the bottom of the benefits list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All members must unconditionally grant full access to their resources for association use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This clause allowed them to pool the nation&#39;s business resources into a single force against Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how formidable Daniela was, she couldn&#39;t take on the entire country&#39;s business sector alone.  The group of eight exchanged quiet, knowing chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the president&#39;s office, Alexande gazed down with a distant, unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he felt as though he had finally leveled the playing field with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe now, he was worthy of standing before her as an equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now leading the association, Alexander wasted no time in setting up a meeing with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading out, he walked alone into the detached villa he had purchased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, an elderly man with failing eyesight and hearing was the only presence. At the sight of Alexander,he silently locked the door and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The basement was cloaked in shadows, the air thick with the damp, suffocating scent of neglect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lay motionless,her wrists and ankles shackled in unforgiving iron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her garments were in tatters, the room steeped in the pungent, unmistakable scent of blood and rust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced motion, Alexander lifted a  handkerchief to shield himself from the stiflng air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The measured click of his footsteps stirred Joyce.Slowly, she raised her head, her body bent forward as if in forced submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, if you&#39;ve got the nerve, just kill me already! What the hell do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;bitch&#34; had been etched into her skin, a grotesque mark of humiliation. Her face contorted with raw fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander lingered just beyond her reach, studying her with an unreadable gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eager for death?&#34; A slow smirk curled his lips. &#34;Not so fast.&#34;</p>
