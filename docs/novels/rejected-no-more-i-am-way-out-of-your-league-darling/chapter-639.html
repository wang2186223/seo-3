                <p>Alexander launched an unyielding chase after Daniela,determined to win her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bouquets, lavish gifts, three gourmet meals a day,and even valuable antiques.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His over-the-top displays of devotion had everyone watching in stunned admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain his grand gestures would leave an impact, but reality had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Alexander&#39;s gifts have practically taken over the storage room downstairs. The cleaning lady&#39;s wondering what to do with them,&#34; Carol informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up from her latest design.&#34;Tell Alexander to come collect them. If he won&#39;t,set up a giveaway downstairs-whoever wants them can have them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a small nod and left. She came back a little later.&#34;Funny thing-I thought Alexander was all about generosity. But the second I started giving them away,his driver swooped in to collect them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered by Alexander&#39;s antics, Daniela shifted gears. &#34;Any updates on Josie? Who&#39;s pulling the strings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the real reason she had come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still digging into it. Ryan and Lillian said they&#39;d stop by after the re-examination, assuming all checks out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a brief nod.&#34;Mm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol added, &#34;There&#39;s a party tonight-hosted by an old business partner of Elite Lux. They really want you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Carol left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Daniela stepped out in an ethereal white gown studded with pearls, making her first public appearance since her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she entered, eyes turned-her beauty and presence were impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she stepped in, her gaze landed on Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had neither the patience nor the interest to entertain him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a few polite exchanges with key partners before handing the social duties over to her secretary  and department heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a seat off to the side, checking the time.Thirty minutes, then she was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander made his way towards her, she was already rising to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk?&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice carried a quiet urgency, his emotions barely contained. He had never seen anyone who complemented pearls as she did.&#34;Daniela,you look stunning tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela idly swirled her wine. &#34;Five minutes. Make them count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does it always feel like you&#39;re pushing me away,Daniela? Why? We used to be close, didn&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;Weren&#39;t you even closer to Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander instinctively moved to explain,but Daniela lifted a hand, cutting him off. &#34;That was a lifetime ago.No need for explanations. They&#39;d be meaningless,&#34;wouldn&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips thinned. &#34;Daniela, what will it take for you to see how I feel? Do you have any idea? All these years, I never married. I waited for you. Can&#39;t you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela propped her chin on her hand, her eyes cutting straight through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, some words lose all meaning once they&#39;re said. We&#39;re both too seasoned for this charade. Why act naive in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face twisted into a look of wounded innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t stop. &#34;During the wedding fire,you chose to save Joyce. Back then, she mattered more because Katrina controlled the Harper family. Later,you stayed with Joyce because she led the Sinclair family. And now, I&#39;m suddenly your first choice because I run Elite Lux. I don&#39;t need that kind of love,Alexander. We both know the truth, so let&#39;s not make this messier than it already is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never been one for mind games-she preferred the truth, plain and unvarnished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s recent antics had sparked rumors, and she had no patience for the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother softening the blow. Rising to her feet, she leveled him with a cold gaze. &#34;You were never that pure. Spare yourself-and everyone else-the pretense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might not recall every detail of the past, but she wasn&#39;t blind to the present. She knew exactly who had been by her side when it mattered. As Daniela walked away, someone lurking in the shadows made a move to step forward,then hesitated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look back. She simply left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had nearly reached her car when Cedric caught up slightly out of breath, a food box in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He passed the box through the window. &#34;The food inside was terrible. I made this earlier, just in case.Your stomach&#39;s sensitive-you can&#39;t go hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine purred to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol flipped the box open. &#34;Sushi rolls. Cedric really knows what you like,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t touch them, but Carol did, and her opinion of Cedric rising with every bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them realized someone was hidden in the shadows, watching their every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night,whispers slithered through high society like wildfire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word spread that Daniela had been injured in the explosion, leaving her unable to conceive.</p>
