                <p>With a calm and focused demeanor, Daniela explained the situation to Alexander, her voice ringing with clarity. &#34;The warehouse had surveillance cameras.Even though the fire may have destroyed the cameras,there must be backups stored somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed as he regarded Daniela, hs voice icy and tinged with anger. &#34;Now you&#39;re just scrambling for excuses to get out of this.Surveillance footage can be manipulated. I can&#39;t trust a single word from you, you deceitful woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela locked eyes with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression remained stoic, but his gaze was sharp and unwavering. Whenever he looked at someone, it seemed to pierce right through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over a decade, Daniela had clung to the naive hope that she might thaw his icy heart. But she never anticipated it would end like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and apologize to Joyce right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His command cut through the air like a chill wind,leaving Daniela feeling as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped on her,her senses reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your wife! Why won&#39;t you believe me?&#34; she demanded, her words breaking with the weight of her vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,I&#39;ve told you-apologize! If Joyce decides to take this to court, you&#39;ll be the one left in tears,begging for mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cutting words felt like a jagged knife, tearing through the fragile walls of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marriage, these ten years of what she thought was love and devotion, had all been a cruel farce. 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp tug on her collar, Alexander yanked her towards Joyce&#39;s ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse sprinted behind them, desperation lacing her voice. &#34;Her rib is fractured. She needs proper care and rest. What you&#39;re doing is downright abusive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Alexander blatantly disregarded her pleas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faltered, nearly stumbling as he hauled her through the pristine hallways and into the exclusive VIP ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room exuded a warm, tranquil aura. Joyce lay in the bed as Katrina, seated beside her, offered her pieces of fruit. Upon Daniela&#39;s entrance, Katrina shot her a fleeting glance then averted her eyes, feigning ignorance of her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression twisted into one of revulsion.&#34;You have the audacity to show your face here! Are you even aware of your sister&#39;s condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, Daniela felt an icy numbness engulf her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Caiden and inquired, &#34;Dad, have you forgotten that I&#39;m your own flesh and blood? Do you recall your vow never to remarry after Mom leftus?You promised to look after me. Is this how you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father wasn&#39;t even willing to allow her the opportunity to clarify or defend herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression wavered momentarily, his brow furrowing in annoyance as he directed a sharp gaze at Daniela. &#34;You&#39;re the one who screwed up! Why are you dragging me into it? You&#39;ve grown quite audacious, haven&#39;t you? To think, now you&#39;d even stand up to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hospital bed, Joyce appeared robust despite her alleged frailty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an exaggerated gesture, she pressed her hands  to her chest as if overwhelmed by a sudden loss of breath. &#34;Do you want Dad to grow old and live the rest of his life completely alone, Daniela? Have you considered how lonely he&#39;ll be once you&#39;re married?Sitting alone in that huge house, with no one to care for him when he&#39;s sick or even pour him a glass of water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Joyce turned to Alexander. &#34;Alexander, do you honestly believe I&#39;d start a fire just to end my own life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent, absorbing the weight of the conversation. His face darkened with each passing second,reflecting a growing storm within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed a cold, unforgiving stare on Daniela and commanded sternly, &#34;Daniela, kneel and beg Joyce for forgiveness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to face Alexander, her expression defiant.Why would she do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Katrina leapt from her chair and stormed over. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, her hand swung through the air, landing a sharp slap across Daniela&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Daniela could barely register the sudden assault before Katrina collapsed into a heap of raw nerves and tears. Pointing her finger at Daniela, Katrina yelled, &#34;Daniela!You tried to kill my daughter! How can you stand there,unapologetic and accusing her instead? Oh, my poor girl! I&#39;m to blame for everything. I never should&#39;ve become a stepmother to another&#39;s child.It&#39;s all on me!I&#39;ve kept you from the man your heart belongs to and dragged you into danger. I can&#39;t forgive myself for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a sharp pang in his chest at Katrina&#39;s torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by a surge of anger, he approached Daniela and delivered a firm slap too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact sent her reeling back, her body hitting the wall as she struggled to maintain her balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dazed, Daniela stood against the wall, her mind swirling with thoughts as tears blurred her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed her gaze on Alexander, a gleam of hope still lingering in her heart. ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently pleaded for him to defend her, to offer even a single sentence in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Alexander&#39;s response shattered her last hope as he said sternly, &#34;Apologize now! Or I&#39;ll have to call the police. You&#39;re facing charges of attempted murder, Daniela. That could mean life in prison.&#34;</p>
