                <p>It was Alexander who had sent the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixated on it, the hours slipping awNay as sleep eluded her the whole night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, as she opened the door, she saw the man who said he wasn&#39;t waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, rooted to the spot, her thoughts spiraling in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave her a once-over. He spoke fast. &#34;Are you feeling unwell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, her mind slow to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric added, &#34;Carol texted me and said you weren&#39;t feeling well. I called back, but her phone was dead.What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Daniela turned to Carol with a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, mid-bite, flashed a cheeky grin. &#34;She didn&#39;t sleep all night. No surprise she looks like a zombie now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows drew together as he studied Daniela closely. He could see the dark circles around her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frown deepened. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you sleep? Is it Hamilton or his sons giving you trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela narrowed her eyes at him. &#34;How did you even get here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked Charles to issue a ban-if Cedric got close to Oiscoll, the plane had to go back immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you even make it here?&#34; Daniela asked again, disbelief shadowing her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips thinned. &#34;If I want to be here, nothing&#39;s stopping me. I flew myself in-skipped the usual runways.&#34; Daniela&#39;s brows drew into a tight line. Her voice was ice. &#34;There&#39;s a wicked wind out there, Cedric. You can&#39;t fly in this-it&#39;s insane. Have you completely lost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric folded his arms across his chest. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you were done with me? Well, I guess I&#39;ve gone nuts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes, just for a breath. &#34;I told you to stay home. I never asked you to throw your life into the wind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cut her off. &#34;The forecast says this wind won&#39;t quit for a week. If you don&#39;t want me here, I&#39;ll be gone before you blink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned, worry creeping into her voice. &#34;And just how do you plan to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrugged. &#34;I&#39;ll hop into my battered old plane -the one that nearly dropped a wing when I landed.Let&#39;s see if it decides to get me home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood there, stunned, words swallowed by the weight of what he&#39;d said. Behind her, Carol threw Cedric a dramatic thumbs-up, grinning like he&#39;d just won a medal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised both hands in mock surrender. &#34;Your call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol cut in cheerfully, &#34;The wind&#39;s been wild all week. No flights are getting out of Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless they hurled Cedric into the sea and wished him luck swimming back, he was pretty much stuck here now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela clenched her jaw. &#34;I told you not to come,didn&#39;t l? You know exactly who Hamilton is. Now that you&#39;re in Oiscoll, getting out won&#39;t be so simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a nonchalant shrug. &#34;In that case, I&#39;m not going anywhere. So, you&#39;re here backing Charles,huh? Well, I&#39;ll just stick around. Whenever you head out, I&#39;ll go too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric, a wave of resignation sweeping over her. She then turned to Carol and said, &#34;When the flights are running again, get him on one and send him back home.&#34; Carol lounged against the staircase banister with a grin. &#34;Consider it done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela arrived in Oiscoll, she bought a super-luxurious seaside villa. The place was massive,with a front-row seat to the sea and a breeze that felt like nature&#39;s own lullaby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grabbed a float and dove into the waves, then spent over an hour jogging the shoreline like it was his personal track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned, he made a beeline for the kitchen like a man on a mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol let out a happy sigh and said to Daniela, &#34;It&#39;s nice having someone around. He&#39;s got so much energy-makes the place feel alive. Plus, we&#39;ve got real meals now. I&#39;m loving it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat at the dining table, eyes settling on her favorite dishes. Whatever irritation she felt melted away with the aroma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Daniela stepped out and called Cedric to join her. Cedric stood under the open sky, sea breeze brushing past him, clad in relaxed shorts-he looked completely at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m dead serious,&#34; Daniela said. Cedric&#39;s laid-back attitude gnawed at her nerves-he was far too calm for a place like this. She had to spell it out again.&#34;Oiscoll belongs to Hamilton. If he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, he won&#39;t think twice about doing something reckless. So when the storm settles in a week, you&#39;re flying back. Until then, you don&#39;t leave this villa. Not even a step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a quick nod, agreeing without the slightest pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, still in those shorts, he spun around and hopped into the open-top minivan with the housekeeper,heading off on a grocery run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two chatted easily, as if they were old friends reunited-regretting they hadn&#39;t crossed paths earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked on, a wide, amused grin lighting up her face. Daniela lowered her voice and asked, &#34;Did you message him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Cedric, he could&#39;ve stayed mad for ages.There was no way he would&#39;ve turned up this fast on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol smiled warmly. &#34;You stared at your phone the whole night. I figured you missed him, so I called him.There aren&#39;t that many things we really want in life.Why make it harder on yourself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life&#39;s already tough. You&#39;ve got to find your own happiness. It&#39;s too short to spend chasing things you pretend not to want. That knd of longing-it just chokes you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced toward Cedric, who was laughing and chatting with the housekeeper in the kitchen.She sighed. &#34;Living on your own terms isn&#39;t easy.Maybe you&#39;ve just never had to learn that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Maybe I don&#39;t. But the moment Cedric arrived, I saw you smile for the first time since you got to Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
