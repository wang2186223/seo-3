                <p>Caiden walked through the front door with Joyce trailing behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was already in the living room,eyes locked on the computer screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air felt thick. Neither Caiden nor Joyce spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to go back to their rooms,Daniela spoke in a clipped voice. &#34;I&#39;ve lined up evening events for you two for the next month. That&#39;s your window to find the person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gave a quick nod,almost too eager</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being Daniela&#39;s father came with perks. At every banquet,he held the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People lined up with fake smiles, each one more eager than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had forgotten how good it felt to be admired again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, it was Brylee who pulled him into that kind of life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was Daniela. That kind of praise was like honey to him. He couldn&#39;t turn away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up from her screen and stared at him.&#34;You&#39;d better find the person soon. If you mess up,l won&#39;t let it slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s grin vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped out from the kitchen, carrying a plate of fruit for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Cedric? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time hadn&#39;t dimmed his charm. Even with that limp,he looked just as good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strutted over and smiled. &#34;Cedric, I never stopped liking you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips puckered as she leaned close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, too stunned to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say a word, Daniela flung a book across the room. Joyce caught it without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not under my roof,&#34; Daniela said,her tone cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce frowned. &#34;Why not? You don&#39;t even want him.Can&#39;t I? He&#39;s wasted years waiting for you. What&#39;s the point?&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before disappearing into her room,Joyce tossed a look over her shoulder. &#34;Cedric, my door&#39;s open tonight. Come if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled back, throwing a nervous glance Daniela&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even flinch. Her eyes stayed on the screen.Cedric crouched beside her. &#34;I&#39;m not going. The only door I&#39;ll knock on is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tossed a fruit knife from the drawer onto the table. &#34;Try it, and I promise you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux carried on with its parade of glamor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day, it hosted another show, luring crowds from every corner of the globe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All day, Caiden checked people&#39;s hands. At night, he attended banquets and did the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His excitement burned out fast. Weariness took its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I need a break. I&#39;m exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent. &#34;Not until you find the right person.&#34; He rubbed his temples. &#34;What if I got it wrong? Maybe I made a mistake back then. It&#39;s been two weeks and no one matches the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left his mouth, Daniela looked up. Her eyes locked onto him, cold as ice. &#34;Say that again? Did you just say you were mistaken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something dark flashed in her stare. Caiden felt his chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you were mistaken?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat went dry. &#34;Forget I said anything. I&#39;ll keep looking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was stretched out on the couch, flipping through TV channels. A man popped up on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack jabbed his finger toward the TV. &#34;Daddy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had asked Jack to call Cedric his daddy. Cedric had corrected him plenty of times, but the kid wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up, her brows drawing together. Then she froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man on screen was giving an interview. He belonged to a powerful family in Oiscoll, and he looked uncannily like Cedric. Caiden had been heading out. The moment he caught wind of the broadcast, he turned back. &#34;Wait.Cedric?On TV?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, Caiden stood frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela assumed the resemblance had startled himntoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her surprise, he said, &#34;Look at his hand!&#34;</p>
