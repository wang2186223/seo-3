                <p>In the past, no matter what Katrina asked of him,Caiden would always obey without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never dared to oppose her, always going along with her wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He showered her with affection, treating her as if she were precious beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had free rein over the finances, spending as she pleased, and he never once raised an objection. His attitude towards Daniela had always been one of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,however,when Caiden saw Daniela, there was no trace of his usual irritation, but rather a subtle,restrained joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t like him at all. Something definitely wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s mother replied, &#34;Caiden&#39;s always been like this for years.Why are you acting so surprised? You&#39;re just being too impatient. Besides, you&#39;ve had the upper hand with Daniela for so long. How could she suddenly flip the script? Don&#39;t worry. You still hold the power over him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hung up the phone. Her eyes lingered on the city lights outside as she murmured to herself, &#34;Looks like Daniela won&#39;t be as easy to handle from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the secretary arrived at the construction site,Cedric was deep in conversation on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to interrupt, the secretary quietly moved past him. As he did, Claude Vazquez scrunched his nose in distaste. &#34;Benny, what&#39;s that awful smell on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benny Salazar let out a laugh. &#34;The company bought a landfill to turn into a cemetery. I was just there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claude gestured towards the object in Benny&#39;s hand.&#34;Do you paint?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benny looked down at the sketchbook in his hand, a slight frown forming. &#34;This? How did I end up with this?; I found it in the trash. It was so hot; I just used it to cool myself off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he made a move to toss it away, but when he saw Cedric finishing his call nearby, he quickly grabbed some documents from his bag and s shoved the sketchbook inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the whole Olisvine landfill was scoured from top to bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, her clothes covered in dirt, spoke with frustration. &#34;I couldn&#39;t find it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were like ice, filled with a cold fury.She stood motionless in the landfill for what felt like an eternity, not a word escaping her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the first light of dawn began to break, she let out a heavy sigh,exhaustion weighing her down. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, she took a long, much-needed shower before collapsing into bed for a deep sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,when Alexander came looking for her, he found Daniela standing on the balcony with her attention focused on sketching the sunset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, she wasn&#39;t dressed in her usual formal attire,but instead, she wore simple, comfortable home clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spacious balcony had a slight chill to the air, and Alexander stood silently behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t one for art, never quite able to grasp its depths, but he sure knew how to appreciate a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was dressed in a pristine white floral top that  shimmered softly in the fading sunlight. Her long hair,softly curled, rested elegantly over her shoulders,swaying gently with each movement she made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered something quietly. Daniela, however,remained silent, absorbed in her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm glow of the sunset bathed her face in a golden light, casting an almost ethereal glow on her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander found himself momentarily mesmerized by the scene before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela set her brush down that he slowly snapped back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a beautiful painting,&#34; Alexander remarked,his voice filled with genuine admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dropped the brush into the tray, then walked to the bathroom to wash her hands. Afterward, she poured herself a glass of water, the quiet moments stretching on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a sip, then finally turned her gaze to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the man she had loved deeply for so long, the one she had once thought was everything to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as she regarded him, there was no longer the adoration or reverence that once filled her eyes.  Instead, she saw him as just another man, ordinary and flawed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost the urge to explore him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small gesture, she indicated the chair acrosS from her. &#34;Please, take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat, Alexander apologized. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry about the sketchbook.&#34; Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a brand-new sketchbook and extended it towards her. &#34;I hope this can make up for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, assuming that a gift would win her over,believed she would appreciate and cherish it as a token of his apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He convinced himself that Daniela&#39;s earlier visit to the Harper family, where she had asked about the old sketchbook,was merely an excuse to get closer to him,as Katrina had suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as he observed Daniela&#39;s expression, the indifference in her eyes pierced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he saw was a cold, distant look, devoid of the warmth he once relied on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t like it? If it&#39;s not to your taste, tell me what kind you prefer, and I&#39;ll have someone find it for you.&#34; The humility in Alexander&#39;s voice was a rare shift,revealing his desire to make amends. Daniela, of course, understood his intentions. A faint smile tugged at her lips, but she didn&#39;t even look his way. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t paint much these days, so it really doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a nod. &#34;I understand. Your company&#39;s doing well now, so l imagine time&#39;s harder to come by.But once someone steps in to help share the load,things will be much easier.&#34; 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, without a word, lowered her gaze and continued cutting her steak, her focus entirely on the plate in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of frustration crossed Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t accustomed to being shut out by Daniela.Just as he opened his mouth to speak again, Daniela had already set down her knife and fork. &#34;I&#39;m done.Are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked down at his untouched steak and,standing up, replied, &#34;I&#39;m not hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her voice soft but firm. &#34;I&#39;m tired. I won&#39;t be seeing you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then walked to the living room, silently organizing the sketches on the balcony, her face unreadable,her eyes entirely distant from him. Alexander had no choice but to follow the silent cue and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the door was about to click shut, a soft sound of footsteps caught his attention. He spun around,his curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his surprise, it was Daniela, who had just been in the living room moments earlier. She walked to the dining table, picked up the sketchbook he had just handed her, and without a second thought, tossed it into the trash can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alexander stood frozen, staring at her in disbelief. Daniela met his gaze briefly, her eyes cool and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the harsh light, her eyes seemed bright yet completely indifferent, her aloofness sharp. She glanced at him for a fleeting second before turning away slowly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, watching her retreat upstairs, her movements deliberate and final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed behind her, and Alexander remained,standing in place, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t understand it. But in that moment, an unsettling sense of cold dread  washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really Daniela?</p>
