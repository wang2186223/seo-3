                <p>With quiet composure, Alexander positioned himself in front of Hamilton. &#34;Did you want to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contempt shaped every line of Hamilton&#39;s face.Though he had plans to use Alexander, it didn&#39;t stop him from viewing Alexander as beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to win Daniela over quickly. Two months is all you&#39;ve got. Fail, and I&#39;ll hand the task to someone more capable.&#34; While delivering his orders, Hamilton flicked a business card onto the table. &#34;Everything you need is already in place. Now it&#39;s up to you to prove yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down, Alexander studied the card. It gleamed with freshly pressed gold lettering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title printed on it named him general manager of a McCoy Group branch. &#34;This is a company we just acquired. It had reached a preliminary agreement to collaborate with Daniela&#39;s company. You&#39;re heading over today, in your new role, to seal the deal. As for tonight, there&#39;s an auction.Based on what I&#39;ve learned, she will attend.You want a woman to notice you? Make sure she can&#39;t ignore you, nno matter where she turns. Surely I don&#39;t have to spell that out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement lit up Alexander&#39;s face. &#34;There&#39;s no need to explain, sir. You&#39;re brilliant-you&#39;ve already taken care of everything so fast. Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll do everything I can to win Daniela over and take her away from Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a simple nod and a wave, Hamilton dismissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning with satisfaction, Alexander exited the office. Glancing at the business card in his palm,he felt a surge of joy so strong he nearly leapt with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During his time in Olisvine, he had exhausted every avenue to form a partnership with Daniela&#39;s company, all in the hopes of getting nearer to her.Yet every effort he made had ended in failure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden shift in fortune caught him completely off guard. Hamilton had already cleared a path for him to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a bold smirk, Alexander marched out of the McCoy Group headquarters, his mind set on victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Alexander disappear down the hallway,Nikolas simmered with resentment. Boiling over, he barged into Hamilton&#39;s study, seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why him? Why do you keep choosing him?&#34;Frustration poured from Nikolas as he raised his voice, breath ragged. &#34;Why can&#39;t you ever trust me?You hand everything to Alexander, but never once let me prove myself. What exactly do I mean to you?Why is it always like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold scowl took over Hamilton&#39;s face, his fury barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the rising tension, the secretary rushed to intervene, urging Nikolas to step out, but he stood firm. Rooted to the spot, Nikolas glared hard at Hamilton. &#34;You&#39;ve never trusted me. To you, we&#39;re just chess pieces meant to follow orders without question. Your obsession with control blinds you,using us like tools to serve your plans. But we are people with our own voices! Why do you shut us out?Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, every buried emotion Nikolas had ever swallowed came crashing to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It baffled him how far Hamilton had gone, even buying out an entire company, all for Alexander to chase after Daniela. And still, Hamilton wouldn&#39;t spare even the smallest opportunity for him to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of him ached to stand where Cedric stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished more than anything to be someone Hamilton would protect without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy gnawed at him every time Cedric was acknowledged. He yearned to be recognized and cherished just the same. More than ever before, he craved that chance with everything he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet again, Hamilton had shut him down, and he didn&#39;t even pause to consider it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t offered a single reason-just rejection,plain and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hard slap cracked across Nikolas&#39; face,jerking his head sideways. Hamilton&#39;s eyes burned with frost.&#34;Take a good look at yourself. Do you honestly believe you&#39;re worthy of Daniela? With your capabilities, even if she said yes, do you think you could keep her? Nikolas, you lack the mind for this.Stop deluding yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury flared in Nikolas&#39; chest. &#34;So now you&#39;re saying Alexander is better than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know absolutely nothing!&#34; Hamilton shouted,voice shaking with fury. &#34;Alexander isn&#39;t blood.Whatever happens to him is no business of mine. If he ends up with Daniela, then good for him. That&#39;s his fortune. As for you, Nikolas, as long as you bear the McCoy name, you are never to have any connection with Daniela. That is final!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold dismissal struck Nikolas silent, stunned in place. Years of suppressed rage simmered inside his chest,ready to burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes locked on Hamilton, Nikolas said without hesitation, &#34;If I had a choice, I&#39;d rather not be a McCoy. I can&#39;t keep living like this, stripped of dignity and denied any freedom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after the words left his mouth, another slap crashed against his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous gleam lit up Hamilton&#39;s eyes as he stared Nikolas down. &#34;What did you just say? Go on,I dare you to repeat it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his age, Hamilton struck wwith full force. The blow snapped Nikolas&#39; head sharply to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeat weighed heavy on him. With a heavy heart,he repeated, &#34;If I had been given a choice, I would&#39;ve never been born into this family.&#34; An even deeper chill took hold in Hamilton&#39;s glare.&#34;Very well. If this family means so little to you, then leave. I have quite a few sons. Losing one means nothing to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Nikolas silent, his breath catching in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined Hamilton would cut him off so easily,without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed in disbelief, holding there for a moment. The secretary hurried forward to intervene,but Nikolas lifted his hand and brushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange calm settled over him, the kind that came with surrender. Meeting Hamilton&#39;s eyes, he said clearly, &#34;Fine. I&#39;m finished with the McCoy family&#39;s business. From this moment on, I will finally live for myself.&#34;</p>
