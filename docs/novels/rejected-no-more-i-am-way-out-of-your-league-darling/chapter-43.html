                <p>&#34;So, why&#39;d you divorce Daniela for Joyce?&#34; Keith,who was also at the gala, couldn&#39;t help but ask Alexander the same burning question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face remained icy as he scanned the room, his eyes briefly glancing over the elegant women chatting and laughing. iN a calm but distant  tone, he said, &#34;I never meant to divorce her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Keith turned to face him, clearly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her choice,&#34; Alexander explained. &#34;She sent me the divorce agreement. She pushed to have everything finalized. From beginning to end, I never once brought up the idea of getting a divorce.But since that&#39;s what she wanted, I just gave her what she asked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith stood there, stunned into silence for a moment before finally blurting out, &#34;Wait! So you&#39;re saying you were the one who got dumped?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caused Alexander&#39;s face to darken further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith pressed on, &#34;Honestly, with your temper,I&#39;m not surprised she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a bitter snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always been this way when Daniela first met him. If she couldn&#39;t handle him now, it just meant she didn&#39;t love him enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The issue wasn&#39;t with him-it was Daniela. She needed to look at herself and figure out what went wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith seemed ready to speak again, but suddenly a commotion erupted near the entrance, capturing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised his gaze, but the crowd near the door was too thick for him to see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, all he could hear were excited voices echoing through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! She&#39;s breathtaking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that another limited-edition Elite Lux gown? It&#39;s absolutely stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela sure knows how to make an entrance-every time, it&#39;s something different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With a body like hers, who wouldn&#39;t look incredible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s got all the right curves-perfect waist, long legs! The guy who dates her is the luckiest man on earth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, is Alexander blind? He chose Joyce over Daniela? That&#39;s just funny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened even more. In a quiet, almost bitter tone, he muttered, &#34;How amazing could she really/be? Elite Lux couture is just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, the crowd parted, and Daniela appeared at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes went wide in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that Daniela? It was the same face, but something was unmistakably different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was draped in an elegant, flowing gown of deep blue that clung to her curves perfectly. One shoulder was exposed, her flawless skin glowing under the soft lighting. Standing tall in dazzling crystal heels,she radiated an undeniable confidence, embodying the very essence of the evening&#39;s queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been stunning, but tonight, she was absolutely mesmerizing. Her eyes, naturally entrancing, carried a hint of allure. When she smiled,the dimples at the corners of her mouth deepened,making her all the more enchanting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, it felt like the room dimmed. All the noise and color seemed to fade away,leaving only Daniela, who dominated the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glowed with elegance, her pearl earrings swaying delicately as she moved through the crowd with effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze followed her every step as she made her way towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, full of excitement, nudged Alexander&#39;s elbow and whispered with enthusiasm, &#34;Here she comes!See? I told you she still has feelings for you.Alexander, your charm is unmatched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander kept his expression unreadable, but inside,his heart was racing in a way he hadn&#39;t felt in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already thought it over. If Daniela showed even a hint of remorse, he&#39;d consider forgiving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Daniela spoke. &#34;Lillian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one word shattered all the hope Alexander had been clinging to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith froze, momentarily taken aback, before glancing at Alexander. His face had darkened so intensely that it seemed like a storm was on the verge of erupting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith couldn&#39;t hold back his laughter. &#34;Alexander,don&#39;t tell me you thought she was coming over here for you? This is too funny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith was practically shaking with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, who was usually so composed and confident, was now being completely disregarded by the same woman who once chased after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela had been obsessed with him,constantly accommodating his every whim, people mocked her for being desperate, but secretly, many envied Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had soaked in that admiration, his confidence reaching new heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, watching him so blatantly ignored, Keith felt a sense of smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, however, paid no attention to Keith&#39;s laughter. He relaxed in his chair, grabbed his phone,and started scrolling, his face blank and hard to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night went on, but Daniela never once glanced in his direction, let alone made an effort to approach him. Alexander, on his part, wasn&#39;t about to go to her either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the gala neared its end, his pent-up anger was at a breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with no way to release it, he simply sat there in silence until the event finally came to an end.</p>
