                <p>Word of Cedric&#39;s car crash spread like wildfire across Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Alexander and Joyce arrived, Cedric had just been taken out of surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in a chair by the door, her face serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked colder and more intimidating than anyone had ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She radiated an oppressive aura, making anyone nearby hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a reporter nervously walked up to her and asked, &#34;Ms. Harper, can you tell us what happened during the incident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly raised her head, her gaze fixing on the reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze in place, unable to shake the chill that spread through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a look so intense, so unwelcoming,that it made everyone around her uneasy. One by one, the people around instinctively stepped back, as if the very space around her had become unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, who had intended to walk over and make a sharp remark, found herself frozen in place. As she caught sight of Daniela&#39;s expression, her words died in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, doctors were conducting a thorough post-surgery examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed seated by the door, allowing only medical personnel to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Executives from Phillips Group had arrived,accompanied by bodyguards, but the guards weren&#39;t needed in the presence of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, undeterred, stayed by the door the entire night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctors and nurses moved quickly in and out,attending to the situation, while Daniela maintained her silent vigil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the lead doctor let out a relieved sigh. &#34;He&#39;s stable now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight sense of relief softened the tightness in Daniela&#39;s gaze. She stood, facing the cameras. Her eyes,bloodshot from two sleepless nights, remained cold and devoid of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know everyone is eager to know about the accident.r&#39;ll hold a press conference soon to clarify everything.Until then, I request that no one-whether media or business contacts-disturb Cedric. Let him have the space to recover in peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters exchanged uncertain looks, knowing full well that many in the business world were itching to get in touch with Cedric at this critical moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning around, Daniela told her secretary,&#34;Keep an eye on anyone trying to get through. If anyone slips by in the morning, make them disappear from Olisvine by the afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she sat down and sipped the oatmeal Lillian had brought her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to Cedric&#39;s room stayed open, but only the secretary stood by, holding a pen, while no one else dared to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pressed her lips together and whispered to Alexander, &#34;Do you think we should go in and check on Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head. &#34;Let&#39;s stay outside. If anything important happens, we&#39;ll hear about it. The  reporters are more on edge than we are anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, the CEO of Phillips Group, had been gravely injured and was now in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news spread quickly, and Phillips Group&#39;s stock value dropped nearly 50% the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Competitors wasted no time capitalizing on the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives at Phillips Group tried every strategy they could think of, but they couldn&#39;t stop the freefall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the CEO, Cedric was the driving force behind the company. With him in crisis, investors naturally began to panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, senior executives at Phillips Group grew increasingly anxious. Despite their best efforts, Cedric was still unconscious on the third day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the market reopened, the stock price hit yet another all-time low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, it&#39;s dropped again. Is Phillips Group done for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s more about Cedric being in serious danger than the company&#39;s future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw him when they took him out of the car.His face was covered in blood.&#34;&#34;Do you think they&#39;re going bankrupt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bankruptcy probably won&#39;t happen, but they&#39;re talking about a leadership change. Turmoil looks inevitable. I&#39;m selling my shares; it&#39;s too risky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m selling as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those were the online comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the most serious crisis Phillips Group had ever faced since its inception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, no matter what came up, senior management always remained calm as long as Cedric was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew that as long as he was in charge, no problem was too big to solve. He had a way of navigating through crises effortlessly, finding solutions when it seemed like there were none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had grown used to relying on him as their pillar of support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this moment of crisis, no one even considered appointing a new CEO. They were all deeply worried about Cedric&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager blamed himself, his frustration clear in his voice. &#34;This is on me. I&#39;ve been taking it easy for too long. Whenever a problem came up, Mr. Phillips  handled it and gave instructions. All I did was follow them.Now that something serious has happened,and he&#39;s not here, I&#39;m completely lost. If the stock keeps falling,I won&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance manager added with a heavy sigh, &#34;The reports from the past few days are hard to stomach.Just thinking about how our stock price has been falling is enough to make my heart race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager exclaimed, &#34;What are we supposed to do now? With Mr. Phillips out of commission, it&#39;s up to us to protect Phillips Group for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick with tension as everyone spoke in low voices, worry clear on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hospital corridor, the atmosphere was heavy,with anxious expressions all around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing this, Daniela stood up from her seat, cutting through the whispers. She turned to her secretary and said, &#34;Inform everyone that the press conference will begin in ten minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned to Daniela instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them were holding their breath for her announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how skilled Daniela was, she couldn&#39;t  change the reality that Cedric was still unconscious.Even if he regained consciousness,his recovery would take time. The investors needed solid assurance. As the CEO of Elite Lux, Daniela technically had no authority to make official statements or decisions on Cedric&#39;s behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,while people&#39;s attention was momentarily lifted by her words, their fleeting hope soon evaporated.</p>
