                <p>Joseph had a way with words, and Hamilton couldn&#39;t help but feel his mood lift as he listened. As soon as Hamilton gave his nod, Joseph left to carry out his order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain came down in sheets all night, drumming fiercely against the earth like a war cry that refused to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside Daniela&#39;s house, the gate was locked tight.Nikolas and Damon stood there, unable to get in.From inside, painful cries echoed out, clear even through the heavy rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, what now? We&#39;re locked out!&#34; Damon shouted, clearly panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face was tense. &#34;Grab something heavy.Smash the damn gate if we have to!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph rushed to the scene with backup, only to see Nikolas and Damon still trying to force the gate open.The loud banging of their attempts rang out through the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s brows knitted in disbelief. &#34;What the hell?Why are you two still out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon.threw a look at the group Joseph brought and muttered anxiously, &#34;I swear this thing&#39;s built like a fortress. It won&#39;t budge an inch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph barked orders, and his men took turns trying to break through. But no matter how hard they tried,the gate stayed firm. Then Hamilton showed up,wielding a chainsaw. Even then, the gate didn&#39;t even flinch. Not a scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph wiped the rain from his face and looked grimly at Hamilton. &#34;This thing&#39;s titanium alloy.Unless someone opens it from the inside, we&#39;re not getting through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton strained his ears, trying to pick out Cedric&#39;s voice from the sea of screams inside. His frown deepened with every second. &#34;Get a locksmith. Now.&#34; His voice was sharp and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The locksmith got to work under the pressure of dozens of eyes, every second dragging as the group stood soaked and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph leaned closer and murmured cautiously, &#34;Mr.McCoy, it&#39;s been five hours. Even if we get in now,whatever&#39;s happening inside... it&#39;s probably already over.&#34; He&#39;d meant to prepare Hamilton for the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face darkened. He scowled and said coldly, &#34;If anyone in there dares touch Cedric,I won&#39;t hesitate to go up against Josh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation surged in Nikolas. He grabbed an axe and began striking the gate like a man possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s voice rang in his ears like a ghost he couldn&#39;t outrun. &#34;Do you honestly believe my life matters more to you than your own? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t have an answer. And yet, that question ate at him. Maybe deep down, he&#39;d always known. He&#39;d just never had the courage to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton&#39;s eldest son, his choices-marriage,dreams, love-had never belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton would never accept Carol as his daughter-in-law. That was the cruel truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could never be together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But standing there, soaked to the bone, Nikolas clenched his jaw. Even if it killed him, he would get through that gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood shoulder to shoulder with him,equally soaked, equally silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The storm hadn&#39;t let up in eight hours, and neither had their resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud cries coming from inside the villa slowly faded, getting drowned out by the pouring rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, only faint whimpers remained... and then,silence. Not a sound was left. At last, the gate creaked open. Daniela appeared in the doorway, calm and untouched by the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind telling me why you&#39;re trying to break down my gate?&#34; she asked, tilting her head in mild annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stared in disbelief. Daniela&#39;s outfit was immaculate-not a drop of blood, not a hair out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the axe marks carved into the gate,then folded her arms. &#34;This gate cost a fortune.Who&#39;s footing the bill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton genuinely wondered if Daniela had lost her mind. Of all times, she had the audacity to crack jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the assassins?&#34; he demanded, wasting no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danielasimply motioned toward the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Hamilton charged inside, with Damon, Nikolas, and Joseph right behind him. What they found inside stood in jarring contrast to Daniela&#39;s cool demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire courtyard looked like a battlefield soaked in blood. Crimson stains were everywhere, creating a grim and haunting sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men were sprawled across the ground in agony. Their wounds were so grave, most couldn&#39;t even cry out.Some clung to broken limbs, others barely managed to lift a hand toward Hamilton for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke. Shock rendered them speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton glanced back at Daniela, who was stepping neatly around the bloodstained petals lining the path.His voice turned icy. &#34;Was this your doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela casually shook her head. &#34;Not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued to stare at her, unblinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light shrug, Daniela added, &#34;Honeŝtly, I have no clue what got into them. They barged in and just started injuring themselves like they&#39;d lost their minds. Joseph, could you call emergency services?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;ll need to be taken out of here before someone actually dies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back at Hamilton, completely unfazed,and added casually, &#34;Oh, and by the way, can I get your brother&#39;s number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked, clearly caught off guard. But Joseph, without missing a beat, recited the number,and Daniela began to dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected instantly, like the man on the other end had been expecting it all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; Daniela greeted coolly, then glanced at Hamilton. &#34;What&#39;s his name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a tired sigh. &#34;Josh McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone turned light, almost amused. &#34;Oh,Josh, huh? Well, just so you know-your men are done here. An ambulance is on the way to pick them up. But I&#39;ve got one problem. Your guys trashed my place. So here&#39;s the deal-either send people to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clean it up and make everything spotless, or I&#39;m grabbing a can of gasoline and setting your house on fire. Totally your call.&#34;</p>
