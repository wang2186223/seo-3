                <p>Cedric was completely overwhelmed. He didn&#39;t dare to call Daniela, worried he might disturb her rest,leaving him confused and uncertain about his next steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan, I can stay here. Just tell me, what&#39;s wrong with her? I have the top doctors ready to help,&#34;Cedric pleaded, his voice filled with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ryan could answer, Lillian interjected,&#34;There&#39;s no need for that. We&#39;ve got a doctor already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned. &#34;You mean Linden? I don&#39;t trust him.I have the country&#39;s best doctors at my disposal.If you won&#39;t let me see her, at least allow my doctors to wait outside. Should Daniela feel ill again, couldn&#39;t they at least examine her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, overhearing this from the side, felt a sting of insult. He was about to respond when Ryan gave him a stern look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look delivered a clear message. &#34;We can judge our own, but outsiders shouldn&#39;t,&#34; his glare said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing his response, Linden stepped back, his frustration clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had already contacted his medical team.When the doctors arrived, they positioned themselves at the entrance, but Lillian forbade them from entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strange scene quickly drew the attention of bystanders and, before long, the press. By evening,a crowd had gathered outside Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian fixed Cedric with a frosty gaze. &#34;Aren&#39;t you content with the spectacle you&#39;ve caused already?Cedric, continuing this way will only lead to disaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the swarm of eager reporters, Cedric sighed and retreated to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t drive away. Instead, he instructed his driver to circle the block until the crowd thinned out.When the area was clear, he returned and parked near the now peaceful entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the security guards remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching one of the guards, Cedric&#39;s secretary said anxiously,&#34;Dude, we mean no harm. Mr. Phillips is really concerned. We&#39;re not here to cause trouble.Can you tell us how Daniela is? Is she alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard looked at Cedric, then back at the secretary, and nodded. &#34;She was a bit unwell earlier,but it didn&#39;t look serious. The doctor checked her and Lillian seemed relieved when he left. So, I think it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded in relief and stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up, his eyes fixed on the dark windows of Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out an envelope with cash inside, he offered it to the security chief. &#34;Look, no hard feelings. If anything changes tonight, please let me know. My doctors are ready to help.&#34; The security chief declined the envelope with a wave of his hand. &#34;Mr. Phillips, I won&#39;t accept your gift. But rest assured, if anything happens, I&#39;ll let you know.You&#39;ve always been good to our boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded and left the envelope there anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chief eyed the thick wad of cash inside the envelope with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in his car, Cedric was restless. His secretary and driver had left to get some food, leaving him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared intensely towards Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, he cursed himself over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been fragile since childhood,and it had taken years to stabilize her health. If the stress of today made her condition worsen, he would never be able to forgive himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spent the entire night awake, restlessly sitting in his car, worried about missing any updates from the security guards. Meanwhile, Daniela experienced a deep, undisturbed sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she awoke, the room was bathed in daylight,sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting warm pools of light across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, Daniela,&#34; Lillian greeted her, entering with a glass of milk. &#34;Feeling any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;I&#39;m feeling fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After heading for a shower, she returned to find her phone buzzing with notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unlocked it, only to be bombarded by a series of headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Phillips is spotted spending the night outside his wife&#39;s building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Phillips issues an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela Harper seems to have everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is a distraught Cedric Phillips&#39; marriage to Daniela Harper on the brink of collapse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the list went on. Daniela blinked, unsure if she was seeing correctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marriage on the brink of collapse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled to herself, shaking her head. Turning around, she saw Lillian&#39;s stern, unamused face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s still downstairs?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exhaled. &#34;Bring him up, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian objected, &#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t keephim in your life. He&#39;s just trouble. You haven&#39;t had a depressive episode in years, but last night you did. What if something even worse happens next time? What about us? What about Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela massaged her tense neck, offering a weak smile. &#34;It&#39;s not as bad as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as bad?&#34; Lillian&#39;s frustration grew. &#34;How can you be so sure that if something like last night happens again, you&#39;ll be able to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to think Cedric was different from other men,rational and steady. But I was wrong. Love makes everyone lose their composure, you and him alike.Daniela, can you assure me that what happened last night with Cedric won&#39;t happen again? Humans are impulsive, emotional beings. We can&#39;t always keep our feelings in check. Bringing a celebrity to a gala might be normal in your circles, but it triggers you off. What can we learn from that? That shows how deeply you&#39;ve fallen for Cedric. You might have thought of this relationship as a trial, easy to end if it didn&#39;t work out. But now, you have expectations.You&#39;re fooling yourself if you think otherwise.Lee mentioned yesterday that you need to keep your emotions in check. Another episode could be disastrous. You should distance yourself from Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed quiet for a while. Eventually, she murmured, &#34;But what if losing him hurts more than the episodes?&#34;</p>
