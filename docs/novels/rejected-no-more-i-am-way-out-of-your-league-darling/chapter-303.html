                <p>Just as Joyce leaned forward, someone yanked her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was icy, filled with a chilling indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked down Joyce&#39;s face as she looked at him miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her wildest thoughts had she imagined that Cedric, of all people, would be the one to pull her back from the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,let me go! I want to die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dragged her inside and dropped her to the floor,treating her like nothing more than a burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his harshness, Joyce felt a strange softening in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments before, she had been lost in a haze,almost ready to end it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was terrified just thinking back on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fear made her vulnerable. She stared up at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were razor-sharp, like an eagle&#39;s, radiating the authority of someone in command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him like this stirred something in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, attempting to mimic how Katrina used to flirt with Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you saved me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had this villa not been the one Brylee left to Daniela,Cedric might have kicked her off the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce remained completely oblivious to Cedric&#39;s true thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, she asked, &#34;Cedric, you do care about me, don&#39;t you?&#34; He remained silent, offering no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Joyce pressed on, &#34;If you didn&#39;t care,you wouldn&#39;t have followed me up here. You saw l was struggling and came after me. I&#39;ve noticed you sneak little glances my way. You do like me, don&#39;t you? I know I&#39;m not as beautiful or accomplished as Daniela. Cedric, I&#39;m willing to be your mistress if you help me pay off the hundred million I owe. My child and I will belong to you completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With newfound resolve, she reached out to hug him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel of his solid form against hers sent a surge of excitement through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce opened her eyes, puckered her lips, and leaned in, but before she could make contact, a hand suddenly pressed firmly against her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, what nonsense is running through that head of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze in place, her gaze landing on Daniela.Confusion clouded her mind. &#34;Where&#39;s Cedric? He cares about me. Where did he go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t stop us, no matter how rich or powerful you think you are. You can&#39;t stand in the way of two people who truly love each other!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed, a scornful laugh escaping her lips.&#34;Katrina&#39;s still in the hospital, and you&#39;re here acting like this is some trashy romance novel? I&#39;m warning you, if you want to die, do it somewhere else. Don&#39;t dare to ruin my home. Even if you die, I&#39;ll step over your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pressed her lips together, holding back her frustration. &#34;Then give me a hundred million, or I&#39;ll pester Cedric. I&#39;ve got nothing to lose, so why should I care about my reputation?&#34; She had reached the end of her rope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sneered. &#34;You&#39;re expecting the debt collectors soon, aren&#39;t you? Go ahead and waste whatever time you have left chasing Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face drained of color. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go visit Katrina in the hospital?Maybe she&#39;ll take care of it for you,&#34; Daniela suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Katrina, Joyce hesitated and glanced at Cedric, who had somehow ended up standing behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she had gone, Cedric let out a sigh of reliefand pulled Daniela close with an arm around her. &#34;Crazy woman. I honestly thought I might end up tainted by her kiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, patting his hand reassuringly.&#34;|t′S fine. As your wife, I&#39;m here to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes sparkled with a new light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the firsttime Daniela had referred to herself as his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips to her soft neck, his voice low as he murmured, &#34;As your husband, I intend to exercise my rights.&#34; Just as he finished speaking, Lillian, who had just come upstairs, quickly spun around on her heel.&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t hear anything. I just heard the maid mention Joyce might try to jump off the villa, so l rushed up. I didn&#39;t hear a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on her way to the hospital, Joyce tried reaching out to several of her old friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them hung up before she could even finish a sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some so-called friends had no qualms in telling her,&#34;Just find a rich guy to look after you. Stop pretending you&#39;re above it all. It&#39;s a quick way to earn money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasn&#39;t even remotely interested in such a suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything she&#39;d been through,her heart still longed for love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps if she met someone like Cedric-someone accomplished-it could be different. But she found  wealthy benefactors thoroughly unattractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her self-respect meant more to her than any sum of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words echoed in her mind. Maybe Katrina could help fix everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Katrina had always been the one to pick up the pieces when she made a mess of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela might have money, but she had her mother,who would go to any lengths for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she got out of the car, Joyce called Alexander.&#34;We were married once. I was tricked, and now you owe me. You should help me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexander had a chance to say anything,Richard snatched the phone out of his hand. &#34;Joyce,you&#39;ve got some nerve! Do you even realize how much you&#39;ve dragged our family down? We got delisted because of your scandals. Our business has fallen back fifty years. I can&#39;t even go out in public anymore, and you still have the audacity to ask for money? Why didn&#39;t those goons just finish you off already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead with a sharp click as the call abruptly ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the blank screen of her phone, Joyce was overwhelmed by a deep sense of dejection. With a heavy heart, she pushed open the door to Katrina&#39;s hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, looking drained and fragile, caught sight of her and felt a sharp headache building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, have you come up with a plan? The debt collectors are going to be here soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed deeply. &#34;Why do you always make me worry so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stuck her tongue out playfully. &#34;If you can&#39;t get the full amount, try for half, at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina glanced at Joyce&#39;s foolish expression,wishing she had known better from the very beginning. &#34;Half is fifty million. Don&#39;t you understand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>how tight things are right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s throat tightened as she swallowed. &#34;So, what do we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the bed, Katrina glanced at a text from her mother. &#34;There&#39;s a man named Doug Fairburne.I told him you need money, and he said he&#39;s willing to help.If you keep him company, he&#39;ll transfer the funds right away.&#34;</p>
