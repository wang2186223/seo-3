                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed, casting a frosty silence over the group that had been eagerly vying for her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,even the security guard fidgeted nervously.&#34;Ms. Harper, I deeply apologize. I saw them arriving together and assumed they were associated with the design firm. So I didn&#39;t confirm their identities before allowing them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of irritation passed over Daniela&#39;s face as her brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that the building was still undergoing renovations, such mix-ups were somewhat understandable. She couldn&#39;t blame the security guard.However, it did serve as a warning for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela dialed Ryan. &#34;Install a facial recognition system throughout the building.From now on, entry is restricted exclusively to those registered in the system.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s reply was swift and affirmative. &#34;UJnderstood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, realization dawned on the group standing before her. One of them leaned in, whispering to Joyce, &#34;What&#39;s the deal here, Joyce? So your sister didn&#39;t give you these floors. How could you bring us up here like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discomfort spread among them, their voices tinged with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, let&#39;s not get wrapped up in trouble. We don&#39;t want to stir up any drama for our families. Our folks made it clear we should show utmost respect to Daniela. What were you thinking,bringing us here to cross her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce fixed her spineless friends with a piercing gaze,her eyes blazing with reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whirled towards Daniela, her voice slicing through the air like a knife. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s this about tightening the building&#39;s security? Aren&#39;t I your sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned her look with a scornful smile.&#34;You?My sister? I&#39;d rather not. The very idea that I would call you my sister is absurd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you implying? You reject me as your sister?You reject Dad too? Just because you&#39;ve come into some money, you think you can discard your own family like that?&#34; Joyce didn&#39;t hesitate to bring up Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a sly smirk, her voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;Am I even still family? If my memory serves me correctly, wasn&#39;t it you who urged them to sever all ties with me? Or is my memory failing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood her ground, undeterred. &#34;Yes, they disowned you. That means the Harper family&#39;s wealth is none of your concern anymore. However, after Dad brought you up, it&#39;s only right that you take care of him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bitter chuckle, Daniela crossed her arms. &#34;Sure,I&#39;ll take care of him-that&#39;s the right thing to do. But you? I don&#39;t owe you a damn thing. I don&#39;t have time for this. Grab your people and get out of my building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s hands clenched into fists, her eyes blazing with indignation. &#34;Really? You refuse to even acknowledge Dad? What about Richard? He&#39;s Alexander&#39;s father! He sent me here today to inspect this place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure of her advantage, Joyce smirked inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard wasn&#39;t just anyone-he was Alexander&#39;s father and Daniela&#39;s former in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed inconceivable to Joyce that Daniela would dare to cross Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced of her victory, Joyce raised her head high,expecting Daniela to relent and relinquish control of the three floors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however,looked at her with utter disbelief.&#34;Feeling a little unhinged, are we? Perhaps it&#39;s time to get yourself checked out. Trying to use Caiden didn&#39;t work, and now you&#39;re dragging Richard into this,who,by the way, has nothing to do with me anymore.Joyce,do you even use that brain of yours, or is it just there for show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Joyce&#39;s face as she processed the rebuke. She glared at Daniela, her voice trembling with fury. &#34;You dare defy Dad and Richard? I&#39;ll make sure they disown you for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely shrugged, her indifference palpable.&#34;Go ahead.Tell them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Infuriated beyond words, Joyce stamped her foot like a spoiled brat, but Daniela, ever composed,had already called the guards to escort her and her friends out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The term &#34;escort&#34; was used loosely here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards forcefully removed Joyce, who was gripping the doorframe with a desperate tenacity,from the premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This scene unfolded under the watchful eyes of numerous passersby, some of whom promptly began to record the incident, quickly catapulting it to viral status online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Joyce? The one who tarnished Daniela&#39;s reputation all over social media? She&#39;s bold to even step out in public after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely shameless. Now she wants a piece of Daniela&#39;s success? Impressive. I didn&#39;t think it was possible to top the nonsense I&#39;ve already witnessed.She destroyed Daniela and Alexander&#39;s marriage, and now she has the audacity to suck up to Daniela? The hypocrisy is astounding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical stepfamily soap opera-no sense of limits or decorum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get this. Joyce was brazen enough to demand control over the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. She had the gall to use Daniela&#39;s father to press Daniela, not just to relinquish her rights but also to cover the expenses for the renovations!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The netizens were abuzz with reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, need a sister? I swear I won&#39;t steal your husband, sabotage your wedding, or stir up trouble.I&#39;ll just be the quiet, compliant sibling you never had.How about it?&#34;</p>
