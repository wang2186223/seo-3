                <p>Daniela sent the recording to Ryan, declaring, &#34;I want this recording and the surveillance footage broadcast across every media outlet for the entire week,starting tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded and made an &#34;OK&#34; gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun began to rise, Daniela laced up for a morning jog, enjoying the calm solitude of the deserted streets. 8</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon her return, she appeared rejuvenated, her skin glowing with the rush of her morning exercise.Meanwhile,Lillian emerged fromn her sleep, disheveled and bleary-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Daniela,&#34; she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela changed into fresh attire. Stepping out, she caught sight of Lillian&#39;s groggy figure and advised,&#34;Go back to bed. I&#39;m heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This roused Lillian fully, who called out energetically,&#34;Your life will be sailing smoothly from here on.&#34;  Outside the courthouse, Daniela paused at the entrance, her presence undeniable in a stark white dress that highlighted her statuesque frame and accentuated her long legs. She commanded attention effortlessly, the bustling environment turning into a mere backdrop to her poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bystanders,whether they were there to tie the knot or sever ties, found their gazes inadvertently drawn to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the street, parked under the sprawling shade of a large tree, Alexander sat in his car, observing the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but scowl at the admiring looks Daniela received from passersby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela waved off the tenth man asking for her number, Alexander flung open his car door and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him approach from afar, Daniela noted the familiar cold,detached expression etched across his face. Such indifference once pained her, but now,it barely registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a nonchalant tone, she declared, &#34;Let&#39;s get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,before she could move forward, Alexander reached out, capturing her wrist in his firm grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown marred Daniela&#39;s features, and with a quick tug, she freed herself, taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of Alexander&#39;s mouth turned down, his face clouding over with a mixture of anger and disbelief. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t test my patience. It&#39;s wearing thin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scornful laugh, Daniela retorted, &#34;Soon, you won&#39;t have to tolerate me anymore. I&#39;ve been here over three hours. Let&#39;s expedite this, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face darkened further, his tone edged with a dire warning. &#34;Are you certain you want to go through with this divorce? Remember, Daniela, not everything in life offers a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s patience snapped, her frustration evident.&#34;You&#39;re right! Let&#39;s finalize this divorce soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She briskly collected two forms from a nearby clerk and began filling them out, her movements sharp and determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood rigid, his eyes narrowing as he towered over her. &#34;I&#39;m offering you one last chance.Admit you were responsible for the fire that day.Kneel and apologize to Joyce. If you do,I might consider letting this all slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was stern, his attitude dripping with condescension and righteousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your time. My knees don&#39;t bend for anyone,&#34; she declared as she slid the completed documents across to Alexander. &#34;Just sign here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed as he scanned the papers;everything was in order except for their signatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm cloud seemed to settle over his face as raw anger ignited in his piercing gaze. &#34;Daniela! Do you think this will intimidate me? Let me make this clear -if you want a divorce, don&#39;t expect to walk away with a dime of my money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed, Daniela pointed to the line for his signature,her voice cool and detached. &#34;Oh, please.That pitiful amount? Let Joyce have it-it might cover her hospital bills one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed on Alexander&#39;s forehead as he mulled over her words. The thought of Daniela leaving without a settlement seemed unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, Daniela promptly signed her name.Raising her eyes to meet his, she wore a taunting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Getting cold feet? Or are you just realizing you&#39;re not ready to lose me after all?&#34;she spat, her words slicing with sarcastic cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was about to reply when Daniela abruptly  cut him off,raising her hand with an air of finality. Her voice was sharp, laced with clear disdain. &#34;Save your nonsense. The idea of sharing a man with another woman makes my skin crawl-it&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This remark set Alexander&#39;s blood boiling. His eyes narrowed into a hard glare, and his voice turned frosty as he spoke. &#34;Is this truly what you want?&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s serene expression held steady,Alexander felt a surge of resolve. Clearly, she needed to learn her lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she thought she could leave him and come back like nothing happened, she was living in a fool&#39;s dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once this divorce was finalized, her life wouldn&#39;t be so easy. Even crawling on her knees wouldn&#39;t fix the mess she&#39;s made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm grip, Alexander took hold of the pen and inked his name onto the agreement. The procedure unfolded with brisk efficiency, the staff wrapping up the formalities in a blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, their divorce was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a group of onlookers voiced their astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe it? Even a woman as breathtaking as her is getting divorced. Where&#39;s the fairness in that?&#34; &#34;I&#39;d love to know which fool is wvilling to divorce her.He must have been out of his mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this guy-nothing out of the ordinary.Why do the most radiant women settle for such a man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a shame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, thinking about another shot at marriage?I know a few top-tier CEOs. Trust me, they&#39;d treat you way better than this joker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a gracious smile, her expression cloaked in politeness as she thanked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away,her gaze fell upon Alexander. He was a little distance away, his features twisted into a severe frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed his sullen mood with a mere glance.Just as she was about to step away, her wrist was seized once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance marred Daniela&#39;s features as she wrenched her wrist back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s tone was icy, the chill in his words unmistakable. &#34;Daniela, do you really think that throwing a fit and divorcing me will erase all our problems? Do you have any idea how much Joyce has been suffering? She&#39;s been haunted by nightmares from that fire for days. You should kneel before her and beg for forgiveness. It&#39;s time to own up to your mistakes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood frozen, a shiver tracing her spine as his words sank in. For a heartbeat, the world seemed to pause,her blood running cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze, the man she had known for over a decade,yet in that moment, he felt like a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped her lips, soft and weary, yet her eyes began to twinkle with a defiant spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I couldn&#39;t agree more. People should pay the price for their mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, knowing smile curled the corners of her lips.Joyce couldn&#39;t escape the consequences that were coming her way.</p>
