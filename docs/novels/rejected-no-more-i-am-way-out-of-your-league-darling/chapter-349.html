                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t have the energy to deal with Erika.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing off to the side, Erika threw a quick glance at Joyce before quietly slipping one of her expensive scarves into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce noticed but chose to ignore it, finding it too trivial to cae about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a sickly-sweet smile, Erika chirped, &#34;So, Joyce, when are you going to pull the reins tighter on Bennett Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much interest, Joyce replied, &#34;When the moment&#39;s right. There&#39;s no rush-just wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce had first approached Erika to set up an introduction to Marvin, Erika had demanded a company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sprawling city like Olisvine, Erika had her sights set on Alexander&#39;s business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buying it outright wasn&#39;t an option since Alexander would never let it go willingly. So, Erika&#39;s game was patience,waiting for the moment his defenses crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re catching feelings for Alexander again?&#34; Erika&#39;s words lingered in the air like an accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression turned icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she might&#39;ve crossed a line, Erika let out a nervous laugh.&#34;Oh, forget | said that. You divorced him because he&#39;s cold and detached. No way you&#39;d go back to that. Besides, he&#39;s still hung up on Daniela,not you. Let&#39;s keep this simple-don&#39;t let emotions ruin the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face remained blank. &#34;Get out. I gave you my word, and I&#39;ll deliver. Just stay out of my hair until then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika chuckled awkwardly and left, but not without snagging an antique vase on her way out. Joyce tossed her phone aside, no longer interested in her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the stark white ceiling, her lips curling into a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the kind of money she had, why would she settle for Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina was anxiously checking her account, waiting for the funds to arrive. But her balance remained unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, she crossed the street, her mind distracted, when a speeding car came hurtling towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen in fear, Katrina couldn&#39;t move. Her thoughts went blank, and her legs felt like they were glued to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car drew closer, her eyes widened, breaths coming quick and shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very last second, a powerful hand yanked her backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stumbled, nearly losing her footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A split second later, the car zipped past, narrowly missing her by mere inches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s breath hitched in her chest. For several moments, her mind refused to catch up with what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling hands, she turned to glare at the retreating white car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach dropped as she recognized that license plate instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other party wanted her gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization was too much to bear, and before she could even turn to see who had saved her, her vision blurred, and she collapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing over Katrina&#39;s unconscious body, Lillian stared blankly before pulling out her phone. &#34;Daniela,she fainted.What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Daniela&#39;s voice was cool and direct. &#34;Just come back.&#34; Without hesitation, Lillian complied, leaving the scene as Katrina lay sprawled on the pavement. An ambulance arrived shortly afer to take her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had braced herself for retaliation, but even in her worst fears, she hadn&#39;t imagined they&#39;d go as far as attempted murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had said she needed to stay under observation for another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katrina turned off the lights and closed her eyes, a sound from the window jolted her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes, barely catching sight of a cold gleam in the darkness. A sharp blade was coming down in the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Katrina could do was squeeze her eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like they&#39;re desperate to silence her. She knows too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes snapped open at the sound. To her relief, it wasn&#39;t an attacker but Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the pale light of the moon, Lillian was engaged in a fierce struggle with a bulky man, fighting with nothing but her bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gripped her head tightly, panic overwhelming her as she tried to scramble away from the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear consumed her-she couldn&#39;t bear the thought of dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fighting suddenly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, Katrina slowly let go of her head and looked up to see Daniela and Lillian standing in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood with her arms crossed, her voice cold. &#34;Where do you think you&#39;re crawling off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears flowed down Katrina&#39;s face as she looked up, desperation in her eyes. She crawled to Daniela&#39;s feet, her voice shaky. &#34;Someone&#39;s trying to kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela&#39;s expression was unreadable. &#34;Who?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face contorted with emotion, and she hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do they want to kill you?&#34; Lillian&#39;s question was sharp and probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart tightened at the pressure of the question. The anxiety coursing through her became almost unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released her grip on Daniela&#39;s shoe and stammered, &#34;No one...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her voice cold. &#34;Katrina, people only get one life. You won&#39;t always be lucky enough to be saved. If you really want to die, I won&#39;t stop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian followed closely behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car sped down the road, she turned to Daniela and asked, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I stay with her? If they try again, taking her out would be so easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers tightened around the steering wheel, her face calm and focused as she drove. &#34;They won&#39;t act tonight. After two failed attempts, they&#39;ll rethink their approach. Besides, making Katrina feel like she&#39;s constantly under threat is far more effective. If she feels untouchable when you&#39;re around, she won&#39;t spill anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the car came to a stop at the Harper family residence, where Cedric was already waiting by the door. &#34;What&#39;s the reason for being so late today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled smoothly. &#34;Just got caught up with some work at the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, his eyes scanning Daniela&#39;s shoes, noting they were different from the ones she had on earlier in the morning. &#34;Did you change your shoes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they got dirty, so I switched them out and threw the old ones away.&#34; Though Daniela wasn&#39;t someone known for extravagance, she did take cleanliness seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that she had discarded her shoes implied someone had touched them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what happened?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply smiled and waved it off. &#34;Oh, nothing major. I just spilled some coffee on them at the office.&#34;</p>
