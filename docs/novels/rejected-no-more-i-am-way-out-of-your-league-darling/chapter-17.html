                <p>Caiden paused, uncertainty clouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t fear of Daniela&#39;s defiance-she wouldn&#39;t dare cross him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather,his reluctance stemmed from a recent public declaration he had made, cutting all ties with her. To seek her out now, after such a proclamation, would surely raise eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would everyone say about this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, they would label him as a conceited, self-centered man, desperate to maintain his grip on wealth and status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pristine reputation meant everything to him; the very idea of becoming fodder for idle gossip was utterly unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout his life, Caiden had lingered in the shadow of Daniela&#39;s influential mother. Now, having finally liberated himself and taken command of his destiny,he was determined to steer clear of any further familial entanglements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Katrina observed his indecision with a keen  eye, understanding that Caiden had no desire to comply with Joyce&#39;s demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent for a long beat before Katrina&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This mess is entirely on me. When you took me as your wife, it was right after Daniela&#39;s mother had passed. All these years, Daniela has harbored resentment towards me, and rightfully so. I can&#39;t blame her-it&#39;s my fault for falling so deeply in love with you. I am to blame for everything. Joyce had no part in this, but Daniela&#39;s hatred for me has dragged her into the crossfire. Now, her business has been damaged. It&#39;s all my fault-every single problem stems from me. I&#39;ll face Daniela and apologize. If she won&#39;t accept it, I&#39;ll kneel and beg for her forgiveness.Sisters shouldn&#39;t be divided because of their parents &#39;sins.&#34; 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was streaked with tears as she rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden grasped her hand, his own heart twisting at the sight of her distress. &#34;Why apologize for the past? As her father, do I really need Daniela&#39;s approval to choose who I spend my life with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden locked eyes with Joyce. &#34;Joyce, you&#39;ve always been the sensible one. Your sister&#39;s the one stirring up all the drama. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll have a word with Daniela. Just give me a little time. Now, remind me,which floor were you considering for your new office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a delighted grin, Joyce clapped her hands together. &#34;Dad, I consulted a fortune-teller who recommended the 18th floor. It offers an incredible view and it&#39;s said to be lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was common knowledge in Olisvine that the 18th floor of the landmark building was the prime spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Katrina&#39;s ambitions for Joyce stretched further.Snuggling closer to Caiden, she coaxed,&#34;Joyce is no longer a little girl. She truly deserves her own space.I considered a villa for her, yet with Daniela yet to acquire one, it seems only fair that Joyce waits her turn.However, now that Daniela owns an entire building, why don&#39;t we gift Joyce the 18th,19th,and 20th floors? It would give her a suitable home of her own. Surely, we don&#39;t want rumors floating around that she is still nesting at home in her twenties,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement, her jaw dropping slightly as Katrina&#39;s bold proposal sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Luxor Tower stood as Olisvine&#39;s pinnacle of luxury,with each floor valued immensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floors from the 18th to the 20th were especially prized, each valued at over a hundred million dollars Acquiring these would not just mnean a lavish residence;it would be akin to receiving a windfall of three hundred million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such wealth could catapult her into the upper echelons of society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly applauding her mother&#39;s strategy with a discreet thumbs-up, Joyce then turned to Caiden,her voice oozing with honeyed charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, considering Daniela&#39;s immense wealth,parting with just three floors should hardly dent her resources,right? Plus, I am your daughter as well. If I ascend socially, wouldn&#39;t that reflect gloriously on the Harper family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle tilt of her head, Katrina moved closer,her words soft yet deliberate. &#34;Caiden, the girls are all grown up now. It&#39;s not sensible to keep them cooped up at home. Plus, Daniela is flush with cash and could really benefit from having a sharp sister like Joyce by her side. It&#39;s beneficial for both of them. Moreover,isn&#39;t it within your power to make such decisions for your daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These words startled Caiden into action. He stood abruptly, his voice filled with incredulity. &#34;As her father, am I not entitled to the ultimate decision?Would Daniela actually challenge my authority? She wouldn&#39;t dare oppose me. Just wait-I&#39;m calling her this very moment.&#34; He glanced towards Joyce, seeking confirmation.&#34;18th, 19th, and 20th floors, correct?&#34;  Joyce&#39;s eyes gleamed with anticipation, and she nodded enthusiastically. &#34;Yes, Dad! Just those floors!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer intensity of her excitement was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Caiden stepped away to make the call,Joyce wrapped Katrina in a heartfelt hug,her face lit up with an exuberant smnile. &#34;Mom! We&#39;re about to be filthy rich. Three entire floors are going to be mine.I never in my life thought this could happen. And the moment I move in, I&#39;ll make Daniela&#39;s life a living hell every single day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, with her arms folded and exuding authority,observed Caiden&#39;s silhouette in the garden. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, my dear. I have everything in hand. You&#39;re the crown jewel of the Harper family.Whatever you desire,I&#39;ll ensure Caiden provides it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, overflowing with happiness and pride,embraced Katrina firmly. &#34;Thank you, Mom!&#34;</p>
