                <p>Daniela paused for a long moment, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she said with cool indifference, &#34;You can stay,but on one condition-you&#39;re not allowed to act on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes lit up, and he nodded without hesitation.His gaze sparkled with quiet excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t wrap her head around his excitement.Being around her meant danger. What kind of joy could he possibly find in this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked around cautiously, then spoke in a hush.&#34;Honey, are you starting to think this might be tied to your mother&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Daniela tilted her head to look at &#39;Cedric.She realized Cedric was pretty quick at pushing his luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d only just given in slightly, and now he was already calling her honey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;Did I give you permission to call me that?&#34; Cedric&#39;s lips curved into a small grin. &#34;Still, wasn&#39;tI right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tossed him a look that barely held interest.&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent all this time quietly unearthing clues,chasing the shadowy truth behind her mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she dealt with the other members of the commerce association and was about to deal with Winslow next, the explosion struck like thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious then-she had wandered too close to the flames of truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever had been lurking in the dark clearly panicked and lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every twist unfolding now was designed to block her path, to make her turn back before she uncovered more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t breathed a word of this to anyone. To the rest of the world, she was just chasing the explosion&#39;s cause, but Cedric had read the truth like an open book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, let me help you get to the bottom of this.Just trust me,&#34; he reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot him a cutting glare. &#34;Don&#39;t forget your own words-you can&#39;t act on your own. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded fast. &#34;Then can I move back tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned and headed toward the lot. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Your own place suddenly feel too small or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft laugh. &#34;I just prefer being around you. And let&#39;s notforget-there are still two ticking time bombs in your place. I can&#39;t relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth to speak, but someone suddenly stepped into her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A masked figure stood before her, voice low,coated in quiet humility. &#34;Daniela. Can we talk for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s patience had already run out. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched a hand toward the car door, but Alexander stepped in closer. &#34;Daniela, just five minutes. That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t known for patience, and right now,she had none to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many five-minute chances do you think you deserve? I could give you a hundred and you&#39;d still say nothing that matters. Alexander, didn&#39;t | already tell you? Quit embarrassing yourself and stop bothering me. Why is that so hard to get through your head?&#34; Alexander opened his mouth,ready to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela cut in before he could say a word. &#34;Every time you show up wearing that heartbroken, love-starved face, it turns my stomach. Go ahead-tell me what you like about me, and I&#39;ll make sure to change it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had swallowed more than his fair share of humiliation already today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come clinging to the hope of finding even a flicker of warmth in Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what he got instead...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you really this cold inside?&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice cracked with heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded without hesitation. &#34;Yep. That&#39;s me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,will you finally quit pestering me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed beyond reason, she slid into her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked the door shut, letting it slam with a sharp,echoing bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander flinched at the sound, his shoulders curling inward as he stood there looking like a kicked puppy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had watched it all unfold and cast a sideways glance at Daniela. She didn&#39;t so much as blink-utterly unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exhaled inwardly. He used to think Daniela was already ruthless with him but clearly, someone else had it much worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric instinctively leaned back a little, doing his best to stay invisible, as if dodging emotional shrapnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little ways off, Joyce stood silently, watching Daniela&#39;s car disappear into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Alexander from behind, sneer curling on her lips. &#34;Rejected again, huh? Alexander, how thick can you be? Whether Daniela regains her memories or not, her heart will always tilt toward Cedric. Limp or no limp, broke or billionaire-he&#39;s still the one she chooses. So stop trying. No matter how flawless you make yourself, she&#39;ll never love you. Not today,not ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned his bruised face toward her,eyes like frozen steel. &#34;Joyce. I&#39;m too damn tired to spar with you. But keep running your mouth, and don&#39;t expect me to play nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he climbed into his car and drove off,leaving dust in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stayed rooted to the spot, her fists slowly curling tight as she watched his taillights vanish. Jack stepped out of the banquet hall and asked, &#34;Mom.who was that just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of venom crossed Joyce&#39;s face. &#34;That man is my enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, she had inherited the Sinclair family fortune, but Alexander had ripped it all away from right under her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she clawed her way out of that basement,the world had flipped. Alexander had bled the Sinclair family dry and crowned himself the commerce association&#39;s leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, she had been cast out, forced to seek refuge in Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t really Daniela she loathed. No-her true hatred burned for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had taken every scrap of success she had bled for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only two reasons she still drew breath-her child, and the vengeance she owed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would be the one to end Alexander with her own hands.</p>
