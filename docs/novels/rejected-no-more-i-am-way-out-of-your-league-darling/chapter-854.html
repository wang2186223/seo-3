                <p>Alexander lay in his hospital bed, hooked up to an IV,his battered body aching from the concussion and shattered leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruises mapped his skin, but his eyes, ringed with exhaustion, glinted with a feverish excitement as he stared out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could practically taste it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d almost had Daniela-almost managed to undress her,almost claimed what he&#39;d wanted for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with blood loss draining his strength, a rush of satisfaction surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected her to be so defenseless, so easily undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who always met him with cold detachment,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had crumbled into helplessness up on that rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the tranquilizer, she was completely fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory made his pulse race with sick delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that raw, unfiltered moment, he convinced himself he still had a chance to win her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just one more try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he needed was a single opening to pull Daniela back to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would claim her for himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was his, Cedric would drown in remorse,tormented by guilt until it destroyed him. With Cedric out of the picture, he could finally have Daniela all to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a violent gust tore the hospital door open.rattling it against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the overhead lights sputtered, casting jagged shadows as they dimmed, while the hallway outside vanished into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s smirk froze mid-formation, his features sharpening with alarm as he made out a shadowy figure standing in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strained his eyes, heart thudding as recognition hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric?&#34; he gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Cedric&#39;s earlier rampage sent a jolt of dread through Alexander&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, he edged backward, his hands trembling beneath the hospital blanket. &#34;Cedric, this is a hospital. Don&#39;t do anything crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The storm outside lent a grim, bluish cast to everything,rain battering the windows and soaking the world in a dreary haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood motionless in the doorway, his face carved from ice, expression utterly unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you can&#39;t kill me. You&#39;ll go to jail! There are security cameras everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said nothing,his jaw clenched and eyes burning with a dark, suffocating intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic shot through Alexander. His trembling hand flew to the call button, stabbing at it desperately-nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stop trying. I&#39;ve already cut the power to the entire hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Alexander like a slap. His blood ran cold.&#34;The security camneras...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was ice-cold. &#34;Are you out of your mind?Still clinging to your pathetic fantasies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face went slack with shock. He was unable to muster a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A relentless rain hammered the city that day, washing away all but the fiercest of sounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric arrived home, he shrugged off his coat,scattering droplets onto the polished floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, Nikolas, and Carol immediately turned at the sound of the door creaking open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared in the entryway, dressed head to toe in crisp black, shadows clinging to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Daniela awake yet?&#34; he queried, his voice low and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced at the clock as she answered, &#34;She&#39;s still sleeping.&#34; She then peered at him curiously. &#34;You were only gone an hour. Where did you disappear to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged off the question, heading toward his downstairs room where he kept his clothes. &#34;I&#39;m taking a shower. Keep your voices down-she wakes up at the slightest sound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three watched as Cedric slipped into his room,closing the door so quietly it was barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon asked, &#34;Did you notice? He reeked of blood when he walked in. He&#39;s really just going to shower and pretend nothing happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at the closed door, suspicion flickering in his eyes. Carol let out a soft click of her tongue. &#34;He&#39;s hiding something, that&#39;s for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the shrill buzz of a phone shattered the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pulled outhis phone, the screen glowing in the dim room as thunder cracked beyond the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, straining to make out the frantic voice barely cutting through the roar of the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever he heard left him frozen-his eyes wide and unblinking, as if the world had stopped spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon noticed first. &#34;Nikolas? What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot him a worried look, but Nikolas just stood there, silent and frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stepped closer, his concern growing. &#34;What&#39;s going on? Who was that? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Nikolas a long moment before he could drag his gaze up to meet Damon&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, his voice brittle with shock. &#34;That was the hospital. Alexander&#39;s whole body has been shattered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon reeled,barely able to process it. Nikolas&#39; voice trembled as he pressed on. &#34;They told me Alexander is completely paralyzed. He&#39;ll never stand again. The only thing he can move now is his eyes. He&#39;ll be stuck in that hospital bed for the rest of his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, usually so composed, was briefly at a loss for words as the gravity of the news set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas added, &#34;Alexander&#39;s bones are so shattered,the doctors only managed to put him back together in the rough shape of a mman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric&#39;s bedroom door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped out, now dressed in pale, comfortable loungewear that softened his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his gaze met Nikolas&#39;, a cold shiver crept up Nikolas&#39; spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp understanding dawned on Nikolas-he would never be the one to control the McCoy family. That throne belonged to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s tone was almost gentle, the casual softness belying the words. &#34;Hamilton&#39;s punishment will make Alexander&#39;s look merciful. Hamilton likes to exploit people&#39;s weaknesses, doesn&#39;t he? &#39;m curious how he&#39;ll handle it when his own vulnerabilities are dragged into the light.&#34; Cedric dipped his head, shadows gathering around him like a storm about to break. &#34;I&#39;m looking forward to the show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last words slipped from his lips like a threat whispered in the dark-barely audible,but they carried enough weight to suffocate the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Cedric turned and ascended the stairs, leaving Nikolas and Damon rooted to the spot,their eyes wide with shock and a chill crawling up their spines.</p>
