                <p>Something about Cedric&#39;s energy caught the secretary&#39;s attention right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although confused by his reaction, the secretary still offered an apologetic smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, this sort of opportunity was the kind people dreamed about. From his perspective, there was no reason for Cedric to hesitate, let alone reject it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A public acknowledgment from Hamilton came with more than just status. It secured a legacy. It should have been cause for celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as he studied Cedric&#39;s expression,the secretary couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that excitement was the last thing on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I say something wrong?&#34; the secretary asked,uncertain now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Cedric replied with a shake of his head, offering no further explanation as he left to find Daniela instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary assumed Cedric had stepped away to change clothes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the weight of the occasion-Hamilton formally acknowledging Cedric as his son-it made sense to treat it with at least some degree of formality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cedric was gone, the secretary took out his phone and typed a message to Hamilton. &#34;Sir,everything&#39;s progressing well. Cedric&#39;s getting changed now. I&#39;ll bring him over shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s screen lit up with a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading it, the secretary could practically hear Hamilton&#39;s smug voice in his mind. &#34;There&#39;s no need for all that. This is a private moment. He can save the suit for tomorrow&#39;s press conference. Make sure he&#39;s introduced as Cedric McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Short and simple as the message was, it still carried Hamilton&#39;s unmistakable pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, the secretary sent back a quick response. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he hit send, footsteps approached. Nikolas entered through the door, face drawn with tension.Meeting the secretary&#39;s eyes, he muttered grimly,&#34;So,he&#39;s finally going to recognize Cedric as his son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need to confirm it. The secretary said nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever fragile hope Nikolas had clung to seemed to crumble in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the street in the cafe, the lawyer glanced up from his seat. Spotting Nikolas through the window,he leaned closer to Hamilton and murmured,&#34;Sir, don&#39;t you think this is a bit cruel to Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly lifting his cup, Hamilton took a slow sip of his coffee before answering, &#34;I never said Cedric would be the heir. That decision will come down to who proves themselves more capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer gave a thoughtful nod, but his gaze drifted back to Nikolas, clearly worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Cedric tended to keep quiet and stayed close to Daniela&#39;s side, the lawyer had noticed something most people missed-there was a sharp mind behind that silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were already forming opinions. Quiet as it was,the competition had begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking with the secretary, Cedric made his way back to Daniela to relay everything he had just learned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped reviewing the latest design draft and asked, &#34;So, what&#39;s your take? Are you sure you don&#39;t want to rejoin the McCoy family?&#34; Without hesitation,Cedric gave a firm shake of his head. &#34;My grandmother raised me. She&#39;s my only family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded. &#34;Then you should go tell them exactly what you just told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty flickered across Cedric&#39;s face. &#34;Will that mess up anything you&#39;re working on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I never counted on you saying yes to any of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was never the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words settled something inside him. He gave a light, grateful smile, then leaned in and planted a quick kiss on her cheek before turning to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Daniela blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Carol let out a soft laugh. &#34;He&#39;s got great timing, that one. Knows when to make a move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the atmosphere had already shifted.Nikolas and his brothers were lingering in the area,clearly aware that something significant was about to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still sitting in the cafe across the street, Hamilton waited patiently, expecting Cedric to come out and call himn &#34;Father.&#34; As Cedric came into view, the secretary brightened with a smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers, however, weren&#39;t smiling at all.Their eyes followed Cedric cautiously, a mixture of resentment and unease brewing beneath the surface</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping ahead of the others, the secretary called out,&#34;Mr McCoy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That greeting hit like a misfired arrow. Nikolas flinched,thinking it was meant for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one brief second, he almost responded. The realization hit hard. His chest tightened with bitterness as he grasped what that call truly meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had changed. From this moment on, he was no longer the eldest son in the eyes of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glances turned toward Nikolas, some pitying, others unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down hard, Nikolas forced a strained smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please head over. Your father has been waiting quite a while.&#34; The secretary hesitated, glancing at Cedric&#39;s clothes. &#34;Didn&#39;t you go up to change? Why are you still in these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paint stains and dust clung to Cedric&#39;s shirt, remnants of the renovation work he&#39;d been helping with earlier</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true that the press conference is tomorrow,&#34; the secretary added gently. &#34;But today still matters. This moment&#39;s going on record. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to wear something more presentable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; jaw tightened. His expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Record? And Hamilton had even brought along a lawyer This wasn&#39;t just a meeting. It was a ceremony</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas cast a look toward the cafe across the street.Hamilton didn&#39;t so much as glance over. His posture remained perfectly composed, projecting authority and confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the secretary&#39;s attention remained fixed squarely on Cedric, oblivious to the tension crackling beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could prompt Cedric again, the lawyer called the secretary. &#34;Are we set? If he&#39;s coming over,make sure he has documents to confirm his identity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from the secretary followed. He turned to Cedric to speak, only to pause when Hamilton&#39;s voice came clearly through his phone. &#34;Invite Daniela to join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Hamilton wasn&#39;t about to let this moment pass without some flourish. After losing face to  Daniela in the past, he now saw Cedric&#39;s public acknowledgment as the perfect stage to flaunt victory in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting to the side, the secretary gave a discreet cough before speaking into his phone. &#34;Sir, perhaps it&#39;s best to wait until all the paperwork is finalized before calling Daniela over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange tension lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about Cedric&#39;s demeanor unsettled the secretary.For a moment, he couldn&#39;t explain it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That should&#39;ve been a big moment-recognition,legacy, inheritance-but Cedric didn&#39;t look the least bit moved. Instead, he appeared calm and collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease settled over the secretary.</p>
