                <p>Fury surged through Hamilton as he spun on his heel.He shouted at his secretary, &#34;Get me Allen Griffin right now! Who permitted him to use my name in the headlines? I sure as hell didn&#39;t. Is he trying to get himself killed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a nod, the secretary replied, &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he turned to carry out the order, Daniela stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother. Allen&#39;s out of the country on vacation.He&#39;s sold the company to me.&#34; A smirk tugged at her lips as she watched Hamilton&#39;s face twist in disbelief.&#34;So if you&#39;ve got something to yell about, I suggest you say it to me instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hadn&#39;t seen it coming. While he was still playing defense, Daniela had already moved several steps ahead, sealing deals before he even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These weren&#39;t small-time operations either. They didn&#39;t rely on external resources, especially not the McCoy family&#39;s. Still, they held a ton of sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the news sector, which had deep roots and massive pull in Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or the film industry, which had grown into a heavyweight force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even tourism, one of the city&#39;s most reliable money-makers, was in her pocket now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t done. Her sights were already on education, and the first steps were well underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the full scope hit him, Hamilton couldn&#39;t move.He stood there, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It chilled him to the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t just bold-she was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was busy posturing, she had already carved out her empire in silence, precise and ruthless in every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the first moment Hamilton truly grasped how deadly her financial instincts were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, for all his talents, knew how to handle real estate and tangible assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela? She didn&#39;t manage wealth, she multiplied it. Using powerhouse industries with no ties to McCoy Group, she had already built a fortune so massive it left Hamilton reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unease that crept into his chest feIt like a weight pressing down. His gaze shifted toward Daniela, and the thought hit him hard that there was no way he could allow Cedric to stay loyal to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of man could ever rein in a woman like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely not Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this kept up, Cedric would be chewed up and discarded without ever seeing it coming. While Hamilton brooded in silence, Alexander approached him. &#34;Mr. McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t bother hiding his disdain. &#34;Do you actually believe someone like you could win Daniela over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric at least had his looks, Hamilton thought bitterly.But Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton never gave his trust freely. When it came to Alexander, everything about him, his slick smile,shifty eyes, that too-smooth charm, set off alarm bells. If Daniela weren&#39;t such a threat, Hamilton wouldn&#39;t have let the man approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze drifted toward Daniela, his mind already scheming. &#34;She&#39;s gotten too bold for her own good. Don&#39;t you think some unconventional methods might be necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no ambiguity in that remark. Hamilton picked up on the insinuation instantly, and it turned his stomach. &#34;You think using dirty tactics to take down a woman makes you clever? If people ever found out I was involved in that filth, I&#39;d be the joke of the century. If that&#39;s your strategy, save it. I could pluck any fool off the street to do better, and at least they&#39;d know how to charm a woman without looking like a creep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruthless as his words were, he wasn&#39;t wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips thinned, frustration simmering beneath his composure. &#34;Then tell me what I&#39;m supposed to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned back, eyes narrowing with cold calculation. &#34;Women don&#39;t care for cheap thrills. It&#39;s not about power or wealth-they chase after what feels real. You give her something that hits the heart,just once, and she&#39;ll cling to it like it matters. That&#39;ll last longer than sleeping with her a hundred damn times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That line hit Alexander harder than expected. His entire demeanor shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could that really be it?  Had he been fumbling the entire time, mistaking pressure for persuasion, brute force for connection?No wonder Daniela despised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the pieces clicked into place, something unexpected flickered in Alexander&#39;s eyes-a glint of reluctant respect as he stared at Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning a woman over had nothing to do with lust-it was about reverence. True power came from making her hand over control willingly, not through force,but through fascination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could pull that off, Daniela would return to the version of herself who once clung to him desperately the woman who stayed even when he treated her like she didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagining it pulled a crooked grin across Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then tell me-how do I make Daniela&#39;s heart beat for me again?&#34;</p>
