                <p>Nothing terrified Cedric more than the idea of something happening to Daniela. The mere thought gripped him with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t fathom why Daniela remained so poised,even knowing Katrina had caused Brylee&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she were a predator, patient and calculating, toying with Katrina while staying in complete control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, another thought crossed Cedric&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else must be pulling the strings behind Katrina, and Daniela had already figured it out. That was why she hadn&#39;t acted yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a high-stakes game, with Daniela slowly cornering her opponent, waiting for them to expose their next move. Cedric had assumed Daniela would be shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she called the police and sent Lillian to the hospital, her composure unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This only deepened Cedric&#39;s confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business was Daniela&#39;s arena, but corporate battles couldn&#39;t compare to the raw intensity of real-life threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why was she so unshaken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove back, Cedric couldn&#39;t help but steal a glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling his eyes on her, Daniela turned to him.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;Are you scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Scared of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Cedric pressed on, saying, &#34;The explosion. When the car blew up, didn&#39;t that scare you?&#34; At his question, Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not scared? Or is this just something you&#39;ve dealt with before?&#34; Cedric asked bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, Daniela shrugged nonchalantly.&#34;Nope. I&#39;m just a businesswoman. I don&#39;t get mixed up in stuff like that. I was just too slow to react.I suppose I&#39;m a bit detached from situations like these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela for a moment before he shifted his focus back to the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the urge to ask her if there were secrets she hadn&#39;t shared with him, beyond being the CEO of Elite Lux and an accomplished businesswoman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as the thought crossed his mind, he realized he hadn&#39;t revealed everything to her either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t bother him, though. They had all the time in the world to truly understand one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Cedric headed for the shower, Daniela made her way downstairs to the living room. Lillian,her gaze flickering toward the stairs, asked, &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;I&#39;ll tell him eventually. Not now, though. The situation is still too murky. If I share it with him now, all I&#39;ll do is add to his anxiety. Let&#39;s focus on solving the problem first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of admiration flashed in Lillian&#39;s eyes as she gazed at Daniela. &#34;You&#39;ve really evolved, Daniela.There was a time when you said if a man couldn&#39;t handle your identity, he wasn&#39;t worthy of you. Are you worried Cedric will be intimidated by you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Daniela replied, &#34;What I fear is not his fear of me, but my inability to protect him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exposing the enemy often meant making hard sacrifices. She had no intention of involving Cedric in the chaos, and she certainly didIn&#39;t want him to be hurt in any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work with Ryan. Grant Phillips Group the airline agency rights. That will keep Cedric busy. By the time a month passes, I&#39;ll have everything in place on my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded, acknowledging the plan.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela entered the bedroom, Cedric was already out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hum of the hairdryer filled the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, still facing away from Daniela, broke the quiet after a long pause. &#34;I&#39;ve told you before.Everything can be negotiated, but your safety isn&#39;t up for debate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to Daniela that Cedric had sensed something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t ready to discuss it yet, so instead,she pressed her soft form against his back, seeking comfort.</p>
