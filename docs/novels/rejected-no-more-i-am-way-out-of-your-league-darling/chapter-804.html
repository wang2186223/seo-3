                <p>When Hamilton said all of Nikolas&#39; fortune belonged to McCoy Group, he didn&#39;t notice the flicker of murderous intent in Nikolas&#39; eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t hesitate once he made up his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ordered his people to take him and Nikolas to the island where Nikolas&#39; private assets were hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the aircraft looped in slow descent over the island, Nikolas leaned forward, voice hushed but desperate. &#34;Dad, I&#39;m begging you. Please don&#39;t take everything. Sure, some of them belongs to McCoy Group, but I earned a lot on my own. Take what&#39;s rightfully McCoy Group&#39;s, but leave me the rest.Please, just let me hold on to some dignity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face stayed cold and distant as ever. A scoff escaped him, laced with ridicule. &#34;Are you being serious? Do you really believe you could&#39;ve earned a single cent without McCoy Group? If you weren&#39;t my son, who would even give you the time of day? Who would treat you like you mattered without that name?Nikolas, do you seriously lack even that much self-awareness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked at Hamilton, stunned. &#34;Is that really how you&#39;ve always viewed me? After all these years,have you truly not seen the effort I&#39;ve put in? Yes, I&#39;m your son, but that doesn&#39;t erase the fact that I&#39;ve been working tirelessly to build something for myself.Can&#39;t you see that? Not even the smallest part of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer came. Hamilton simply raised a hand and gestured toward the clearing below. &#34;Direct the other planes to land there,&#34; he told the pilot coolly.&#34;And unload everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the pilot felt sorry for Nikolas and glanced at him sympathetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy mix of shame and helplessness sank deep into Nikolas&#39; chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as the fleet began its descent, one plane veered sharply,breaking from the pattern like a rogue shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; Hamilton stiffened,irritation flaring in his eyes. &#34;Who gave that pilot permission to go off-script? Reckless idiot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion etched itself across the pilot&#39;s face as he watched the aircraft veer off course. &#34;That&#39;s not right.I never issued a command for that one to break formation. Why&#39;s it moving on its own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, eyes narrowing as he tracked the rogue plane. &#34;Mr. McCoy, that pilot is not one of ours.&#34; After another second of squinting, he added in disbelief, &#34;It looks like a woman&#39;s flying it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s head jerked up, a spark of alarm flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34; A creeping tension settled over his expression. &#34;What the hell is she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word came from NVikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he meant so little in Hamilton&#39;s eyes, then what was the point of chasing approval that would never come?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might as well resign himself to being a failure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton paid no attention to Nikolas and turned to the pilot instead. &#34;What exactly is she trying to pull?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, Daniela&#39;s aircraft circled tighter and lower, scanning the terrain below like a hawk zeroing in on its prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;She&#39;s targeting the assets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even finish processing the thought,Daniela&#39;s plane released a bomb with chilling precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky shattered with a thunderous blast, smoke mushrooming upward in thick, violent plumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the haze lifted, the aftermath came into view-a massive crater scorched into the earth below</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared in shock, eyes wide. &#34;What the hell is Daniela doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answver was obvious now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was leveling the island to the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sending a message loud and clear-anyone who dared to cross Cedric would pay back ten times over</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas,lost in hopelessness moments earlier, now sat frozen in disbelief at the chaos unraveling before his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched in awe as Daniela released bomb after bomb. The blasts ripped through the land until the island sank beneath the waves, vanishing into the depths like it never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s insane!&#34; Hamilton never imagined she&#39;d go this far.Furysurged through him, trembling in his clenched jaw. &#34;Daniela&#39;s lost it-completely unhinged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him,Nikolas felt something unexpected-envy.Cedric had someone willing to burn the world down for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished that someone would defend him so fiercely and without reservation. With the island gone, the planes banked and began their return</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exited her aircraft, calm and unbothered, while Hamilton barreled toward her like a storm barely restrained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, do you honestly believe this means you&#39;ve won? Those bombs came with a hefty price tag You&#39;re the one taking the loss here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his rage with a slow, deliberate smile With everyone watching, she responded, &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. Those bombs did cost me a lot That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m here-to let you know that if you so much as lay a finger on Cedric, you&#39;d better be ready to burn right along with me. I believe I&#39;ve made myself very clear today.&#34;</p>
