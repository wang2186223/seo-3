                <p>Lillian stood up, ready to step in and stop Caiden from speaking any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela stopped her with nothing more than a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Daniela&#39;s spine, creeping through her entire body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole situation was almost laughable, but there was no humor in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a bright, sunny afternoon, her own father was haggling with Cedric, trying to settle on a price to sell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, she had given her all to Alexander,and Caiden knew why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, he watched her fall even further, knowing full well that the person from her past was Cedric,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but he never said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He constantly reminded her to return Alexander&#39;s favor, even taking satisfaction in her marriage to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw her chase after Alexander, only to be rejected, and eventually, he watched her go through the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, someone who knew the whole truth, had seen it all unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was supposed to be her father, the one who should have protected her. Yet, he remained utterly cold and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing was pure nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about it made her want to scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela couldn&#39;t find the strength to laugh at it;instead, she felt a deep, bone-chilling cold that seemed to freeze her from the inside out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to look out the window, her gaze falling on the large tree outside, its shadow shifting with the breeze as sunlight scattered across the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never felt more foolish than she did now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And all these years, what had Caiden thought as he watched her tirelessly chase after Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he find it entertaining? Or simply laugh at her expense? Or perhaps he took a twisted satisfaction in the idea that Brylee had given birth to such a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Daniela only wNanted one answer: did Caiden truly see her as his daughter? How could he treat her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hands tightened into fists, her grip becoming almost painful. She remained seated,subtly signaling Lillian to stay down as well. A bitter,self-mocking smile tugged at her lips as she realized that any further questions would only make her appear more foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked out the window in despair. Her eyes, once warm, were now void of all softness, replaced by a cold emptiness. Behind Daniela, Cedric and Caiden continued their conversation, unaware of her silent presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, when I first saw you, I knew you were the boy who helped pull Daniela out of her depression all those years ago,&#34; Caiden said, pointing to a spot near his eye. &#34;You have this little mole, and that&#39;s how l recognized you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile spread across his face. &#34;But I kept it to myself. I thought it was quite amusing. Isn&#39;t Daniela always so proud? Isn&#39;t she wealthy? Yet she couldn&#39;t even recognize you. No matter how successful she is, she&#39;s still blind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fingers tightened around his coffee cup, his restraint barely keeping him from hurling it at Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice remained calm as he asked, &#34;But Daniela isn&#39;t Brylee. She&#39;s your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she?&#34; Caiden&#39;s face remained emotionless.&#34;The only one who truly counts as my daughter is the one who&#39;ll take care of me when I&#39;m old. Can Daniela do that? I once felt sorry for her. I even thought about telling her that Alexander wasn&#39;t the one who was with her back then, hoping it might ease her pain after the divorce. I showed her kindness, only to be met with her indifference. Can I really trust someone like that when I&#39;m older?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed, his voice taking on a sharper edge.&#34;So your idea of a good daughter is someone who will take care of you in your old age?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, we raise children, hoping they&#39;ll care for us in our old age. But now I see things clearly.Daniela is just as cold and ruthless as her mother.I can&#39;t depend on her, and frankly, I don&#39;t care what happens to her or who she marries. Cedric, since we&#39;re being honest, let&#39;s strike a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Caiden had dropped all pretense. He had revealed his true, selfish self, his expression cold and calculating. A sharp laugh escaped his lips. &#34;Cedric,name your price. Daniela&#39;s life or death no longer matters to me. Consider her sold to you. It&#39;s a one-time deal. You can take her home, treat her however you want, and make her serve you as you please.I have no objections.&#34;</p>
