                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression was etched with deep concern for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had shoved Carol and Cedric aside with a forceful push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden shove sent Carol and Cedric stumbling back a step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,still weak from his leg injury and only recently regaining consciousness, teetered on the edge of losing his balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for his secretary&#39;s quick reflexes, steadying him from behind, he might have fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knitted together at the sight, but as Cedric steadied himself, her expression gradually eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes were burning with determination. This was his moment, his chance to reclaim her. &#34;I&#39;ve regretted everything. Divorcing you was a mistake. Let&#39;s fix it-let&#39;s get remarried!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s brows drew together in a deep, disapproving frown. &#34;Alexander, have you lost your mind? This isn&#39;t the time for this! Daniela is still recovering. Weren&#39;t you listening to the doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander dismissed Carol&#39;s words with a casual wave.&#34;It&#39;s just temporary memory loss, nothing serious Daniela needs someone to take care of her. Our divorce was a mistake, a misunderstanding. This is fate giving us another chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned to Daniela, his voice laced with urgency. &#34;Daniela, let&#39;s start over. Let me take care of you,cherish you the way I should have.I know now-Joyce set that fire, not you. I was wrong, and I regret it every day. Give me one more chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping to one knee with a flourish,Alexander pulled a ring from his pocket. &#34;Daniela, please! Marry me again. Just one more chance I swear I won&#39;t make the same mistakes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew heavy with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Carol&#39;s sharp voice cut through the tension.&#34;Alexander, this is a hospital! Have you completely lost it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t even glance at Carol. His gaze was locked on Daniela, his expression one of raw devotion.To anyone watching, he might have looked like a man hopelessly in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ll make things right this time. No matter what happens, I&#39;ll be by your side. Everything that happened before-it&#39;s behind us now. Fate brought us back together; don&#39;t let it go to waste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knitted together. Her eyes flickered past Alexander, landing on Cedric, who stood quietly behind him. After a brief pause, her gaze settled back on Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was calm, deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face brightened with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, there was simply no way Daniela would turn him down now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to still be completely in love with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he proposed now, there was no reason for her to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Alexander&#39;s imagination, Daniela must be thrilled and would surely say,&#34;I do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may have lost my memory, but I&#39;m not a fool.&#34;Daniela&#39;s voice was sharp, slicing through his illusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face stiffened at her words. He gawked at Daniela,his eyes clouded with confusion and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re divorced. You&#39;re my ex-husband. And unless I misheard, I already have a husband,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hurried to clarify, &#34;Yes, you do, but that was just a misunderstanding. Daniela, you were upset because | believed Joyce over you, so you married Cedric just to get back at me. That memory must have been too painful for you, so you buried it deep.Doesn&#39;t that make perfect sense? Out of everything you&#39;ve lost, you still remember me. What does that tell you? It proves you still care about me. You&#39;re in love with me! Daniela, quit lying to yourself. You know you love me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he spoke, the more fervent he became,reaching out to slide the ring onto Daniela&#39;s finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a hand shot out, clamping onto Alexander&#39;s wrist with enough force to send a sharp jolt of pain through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip loosened, and the ring, along with its velvet box,tumbled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes widened in shock. How could Cedric, after three years in bed, still be this strong? &#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t want this.&#34; Cedric&#39;s gaze was sharp,unwavering. &#34;You can&#39;t force her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could she not want to? She&#39;s just not thinking clearly yet!&#34; Alexander snapped, frustration burning in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no patience for this chaos. She shot Carol a glance. &#34;We&#39;re leaving.&#34; Elite Lux demanded her attention, and she had just regained consciousness.She wasn&#39;t about to waste her energy on pointless drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice rang out as she walked away. &#34;Dinner tonight. Eight o&#39;clock. The restaurant in Dreamland Hotel. I&#39;ll be there waiting for you!&#34; he called out, his voice chasing after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she vanished from view, Alexander smirked and turned to Cedric. &#34;This time, Cedric, I&#39;m winning her back for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s stare was frigid. &#34;Is that so? Maybe-if her memory had stopped earlier. But it didn&#39;t. It ends at the divorce. You don&#39;t know her. She never second-guesses her choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander barely blinked. &#34;We&#39;ve got over ten years together. She&#39;ll give me a chance. But you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to Cedric&#39;s injured leg. &#34;How could someone like you ever make her happy? What makes you think she&#39;d pick you? Cedric, a man should know his limits. If you really loved her, you&#39;d want her happy -not tied down by a burden like you.&#34;</p>
