                <p>After blowing off steam outdoors, Brad finally made his way back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon stepping into the house, he noticed HHamilton had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grumble slipped from Brad, &#34;What a hassle.&#34; He quickly plastered on a smile and asked, &#34;I thought you went to find Nikolas. Why are you back already? Isn&#39;t this situation with your son supposed to be urgent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shrugged. &#34;I talked to him. That boy claimed he didn&#39;t need me meddling. When I pressed him about Carol, he flat-out denied any interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A snort escaped Brad, his eyes rolling.&#34;Do you honestly buy that? Nikolas, with all his pride-if he didn&#39;t care about Carol, would he be sneaking her snacks at night or staying up to play games with her? That doesn&#39;t sound like indifference to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Hamilton didn&#39;t trust Nikolas&#39; answer. Still, without a confession, there wasn&#39;t much else to pursue. Besides, he didn&#39;t want to leave this house for too long. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that trouble might be lurking for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the tension on Hamilton&#39;s face, Brad said, &#34;What&#39;s got you so anxious? Daniela barely leaves the house.What do you think could possibly happen? And don&#39;t forget, I&#39;m around. I have a stake in her business; why would I do anything to Daniela? Not to mention, Cedric and Daniela are always alert.You hanging around here does nothing. Nikolas is a different story-he actually listens to you. Just now, Egan called, wanting to meet for coffee tomorrow afternoon. Clearly, he wants to talk about Nikolas. These chances don&#39;t come often. If you let it pass, where else will Nikolas find such a strong match for an alliance down the road?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took a moment before saying, &#34;So... should I meet him tomorrow afternoon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Don&#39;t hesitate. Go,&#34; Brad responded, his tone insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived, and Hamilton stepped out, sharply dressed in a crisp black suit. Returning from her walk, Daniela caught sight of his formal look and called out, &#34;Will you be joining us for lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hamilton answered, &#34;I have some business to handle, so I won&#39;t be home for lunch.You should have someone accompany you when you go walking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes landed on Carol, who was just making her way in from the yard, and he added with a note of worry,&#34;Take Cedric along. It&#39;s busy out there. Please don&#39;t head out alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he walked out the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Daniela stood by, watching as he disappeared down the path, then pulled out her phone to text the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A response came back right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the reply, Daniela paused in thought, then turned and made her way back to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered at the entrance, letting her eyes rest on Carol for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Carol noticed, Daniela had already slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad kept an eye on Hamilton until he disappeared from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lounged on the sofa and caught sight of Cedric handing Daniela a small bowl of pomegranate seeds. It was the bowl he had poisoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug grin played on Brad&#39;s lips as he called out, &#34;Bring me a cup of coffee,&#34; directing the housekeeper with a wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a steaming cup arrived. Brad, distracted by the television and stealing glances at Daniela, failed to notice that a man&#39;s hand had placed the cup before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wearing that satisfied smile, he took a long sip, settling even deeper into his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan came strolling in from outside and asked offhandedly, &#34;Brad, have you written out your confession yet?&#34; That wiped the grin right off Brad&#39;s face. He shot a nervous glance toward Daniela and Cedric, making sure they hadn&#39;t heard, then hissed, &#34;Confession? Are you insane? Who could write such a thing? Didn&#39;t you already write ohe? Leave me out of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Then what are you hanging around for? Shouldn&#39;t you be back at Josh&#39;s place by now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to react, Brad slapped a hand over Ethan&#39;s mouth and hustled him away to his bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, hearing the noise, glanced their way and then focused on the empty coffee cup nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid, unaware of anything unusual, spotted the finished cup and promptly brewed a fresh one, bringing it out with practiced efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sternly warning Ethan to keep his mouth shut, Brad slipped out and retrieved the second coffee,savoring a leisurely sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rich scent made him close his eyes in contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just five days, he reminded himself, the poison would start working again, and 40% of McCoy Group&#39;s shares would be his for the taking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humming a tuneless song, Brad swung his legs back and forth, entirely pleased with how things were unfolding.</p>
