                <p>Upon their return from the hospital, Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce were greeted by the sight of Daniela, who was still engrossed in her game, oblivious to their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie, always perceptive, quickly sensed a change in Caiden&#39;s demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce also appeared unusually subdued, thei typical arrogance replaced by what seemed like obsequiousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Caiden called out, making his way towards her with his arm in a cast. He leaned over for a closer look at her phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he clearly noticed in the upper-left corner of her screen the words &#39;Host Mode,&#39; followed by the number 1.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce also approached, peeking at the screen. When she saw it, she gasped, her expression one of thrilled surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s laugh echoed, softer and more conciliatory than before. &#34;Sweetheart, I admit I was wrong.The harsh words about your mother were unjustified. I deserve the fallout. But remember, Daniela, we&#39;re family,and there should be no enduring resentment between us, right? Please, don&#39;t hold a grudge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up from her phone, a mild surprise registering on her face, followed by a look of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had anticipated Caiden would brood for weeks, if not months, given their earlier conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously,when Katrina joined the family, Daniela&#39;s mere refusal to eat Katrina&#39;s cooking had led Caiden to shun her for a full year.3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Daniela was just five years old, mourning her mother&#39;s death and yearning for her father&#39;s affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His detachment had left her feeling abandoned and heartbroken, which eventually led her into a deep depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with his arm in a sling, Caiden was unexpectedly showering her with attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This change in his behavior was quite astonishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden,&#34; Daniela addressed him, her eyebrow raised and a faint, sarcastic smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,all too familiar with that unsettling smile, tensed up, sensing that the conversation might take an unpleasant turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were his options,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had decided-in matters of wealth, pride was expendable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t he compromised his own pride time and again for Brylee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could flatter her, surely he could do the same with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover,Daniela was unmarried. If her fate mirrored Brylee&#39;s and she passed away young, her vast wealth would naturally revert to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Caiden&#39;s perspective, Daniela was more than just his daughter-she was a veritable treasure trove,especially if her single mobile game could potentially rake in billions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He marveled at her knack for amassing wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to ingratiate himself, he flashed a nearly subservient smile and inquired, &#34;What do you need from me,Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response came with a soft chuckle, her smile razor-sharp. &#34;You have mastered the art of subservience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s smile abruptly vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had assumed you retained some pride,&#34; Daniela said mockingly.′′Clearly, I was mistaken. My grandmother once called you spineless, and I thought she exaggerated. Yet here you are, proving her point. No wonder my mother was deceived by you.&#34; At this point, Caiden was unáble to even feign a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had a cruel way of striking precisely where it hurt most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, sharp and cutting, left him feeling stripped of any remaining dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her words were tangible weapons, he would have been sprawled on the floor,fatally wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly intervened, trying to alleviate the tension. &#34;Daniela, consider what you&#39;re saying. Your father genuinely cares for you. Isn&#39;t it normal for a father to want the best for his daughter? We&#39;re all delighted that you&#39;ve decided to stay with us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face remained impassive and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to Joyce, hoping she would contribute something positive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joyce was engrossed with Lillian&#39;s phone, her eyes wide with excitement. &#34;Lillian! This skin is incredible! Could you gift me one? I had no idea so mnany beautiful unreleased skins existed. Please, I&#39;m literally begging,just one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her zealous, flattering manner made Caiden&#39;s and Katrina&#39;s earlier, more genuine attempts seem downright hollow by comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was mortified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his jaw and continued,′′Aharmonious family is what we all want, right? Daniela, I know l&#39;ve been neglectful in the past, and | accept full responsibility. But I&#39;m getting older, and it&#39;s time to leave the past behind. I promise to make amends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, watching Daniela&#39;s expression, which remained unaffected. Emboldened,he added,instructed my team to transfer the overseas assets back. Daniela, that money was being saved for your wedding. It was always intended for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyebrows lifted slightly,her lips twisting into a faint, sarcastic smile.&#34;Oh,you were setting aside a wedding gift for me with the company&#39;s operating funds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was momentarily at a loss for words. Daniela continued, &#34;So, to clarify, if this money earns any future profits, i can subtract those from your share of the company dividends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood dumbfounded, questioning her implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the problem?&#34; Daniela inquired, her tone sharp.that not acceptable? Or are you rétracting your promise already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden could muster a reply, Katrina intervened with a forced smile.&#34;Of course it&#39;s acceptable! Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Daniela, you&#39;re family. What&#39;s yoursis yours. We&#39;re just short on cash right now, but rest assured, you&#39;ll receive everything you&#39;re entitled to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded slightly in acknowledgment. Then, as though it were the most logical step, she reached under the table and produced a blank sheet of paper. &#34;In that case, let&#39;s formalize it. Write me an lOU.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened. &#34;Daniela, is that really necessary among family? It feels so impersonal, doesn&#39;t it?We&#39;re united in this, and our word is solid. You don&#39;t need a document to confirm that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of issuing an IOU-a binding acknowledgment of debt to Daniela-was intolerable for Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had merely been a placating gesture, a temporary solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s insistence on formalizing it marked a serious shift.</p>
