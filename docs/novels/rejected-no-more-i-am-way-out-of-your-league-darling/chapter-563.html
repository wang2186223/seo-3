                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes ignited with a venomous, unsettling loathing as she pierced Alexander with her glare.&#34;Never forget, the very fabric of your status and dignity is woven from my efforts.When disaster struck the Bennett family, who was your rock? When society shunned you, who was the solitary figure extending a hand in the darkness? Throughout these tumultuous years, I&#39;ve remained steadfastly by your side.Alexander,pry your eyes open and see the truth-it&#39;s me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander returned her gaze, his eyes alight with an icy fury that chilled the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You claim it was you?&#34; His voice was clipped,harsh with a venom that could freeze blood. &#34;You dare to stand there and claim credit? Let me tell you, Joyce,the empire I built stands on the graves of my pride and conscience. I&#39;ve become a monster, someone l once viewed with contempt. And you? Far from a savior, you&#39;ve been a millstone around my neck,treating me as nothing more than a pawn in your games, never as your husband. Your so-called care was merely a facade, spurred by your ego,craving dominance over me. If not for your machinations,Bennett Group wouldn&#39;t have toppled so disastrously.If not for your meddling, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have divorced me and married Cedric. Every misfortune that has befallen me has your fingerprints all over it!You have no right to keep breathing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander advanced on Joyce, his hands clasping around her throat in an iron-tight embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers clamped down with relentless force,squeezing the breath from her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down, he watched as Joyce&#39;s face slowly drained of color. He savored the dominance he wielded over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Joyce&#39;s eyes began to flutter shut, Alexander&#39;s grip loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce crumpled to the floor, her breaths erupting into violent coughs. Yet, amidst the gasping, a wild,hysterical laughter began to bubble up from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her cheeks as she looked up at Alexander,her laughter ringing in the chilling air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You regret it now, don&#39;t you? How could you not?You let the world&#39;s richest slip through your fingers,and Cedric has made her his wife. In the quiet of night,do you torment yourself with thoughts of what might have been if you hadn&#39;t chosen me back then? Can you truly blame me? It&#39;s not my fault, Alexander. It&#39;s your own gullibility. You swallowed every lie I spun,even when the truth was laid bare in those recordings. You knew I orchestrated the fire at your wedding to Daniela,yet you still stood by me. Why? Because of your own foolishness! You were blind to your true feelings for Daniela,convinced that she, who always stood by your side, would never leave. Growing up without a mother&#39;s love, you were desperate for unwavering loyalty, never understanding that loyalty must be reciprocated. Only later did you understand,but by then, it was far too late. Daniela, when in love,gave her all. Yet, when her love faded, she severed ties ruthlessly. Regret gnawed at you, but no action could undo what had been done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice rang out, filled with a malicious glee.&#34;Alexander, witnessing the regret etching your face brings me no end of joy. Your own foolishness cost you the love of your life! Now, you&#39;re destined to wander loveless as your eternal punishment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeling from her wNords,Alexander staggered from the villa, each of Joyce&#39;s spiteful remarks stabbing at his heart like cold steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, he had been a fool-a fool who lost the most profound love he had ever known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that&#39;s not the end of it. There will be a way to set things right-there has to be!&#34; Alexander reassured himself, fleeing the scene as though running from his own shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to him, as he fled, the basement door behind him creaked open, nudged by the whispering wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a considerable time before Alexander managed to collect himself. He had to meet Daniela soon, and he repeated to himself over and over: the past was just that,the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to compensate Daniela for past shortcomings with future endeavors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting took place at Alexander&#39;s recently inaugurated hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon witnessing Daniela and Lillian&#39;s arrival, a wave of relief washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had dreaded the possibility of Daniela showing up with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take a seat, Daniela,&#34; Alexander offered warmly, his tone brimming with attentiveness. &#34;The steak here is exceptional. I recommend giving it a try today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, showing little interest, responded tersely,&#34;You orchestrated this meeting through a friend of my mother&#39;s. Surely, we&#39;re not here just to dine, are we?Let&#39;s skip the pleasantries and focus on the matter at hand. We don&#39;t have all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her directness, Alexander&#39;s smile remained unshaken, as if her words held no power to disrupt his mood today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Considering your hectic schedule, I made sure to schedule our meeting after business hours. We have a shared history since childhood, after all. Why not enjoy a meal together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Alexander helped Daniela slice her steak before placing it before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This steak was sourced fresh this morning. I had initially wanted to cook it myself for you, but sadly,my culinary skills fall short. This time, the chef&#39;s expertise will have to suffice. Next time, however, I promise to prepare the meal myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was well aware that recently, all of Daniela&#39;s meals were personally prepared by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gesture was a clear challenge, a declaration that he could match-and surpass-anything Cedric could do for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t interested. Her face scrunched in displeasure at the aroma of the steak-truly overpowering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat loudly. &#34;Ahem! Ahem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of nausea overtook her, draining the color from her cheeks until she looked positively ghastly. Turning to Lillian, she signaled for her to remove the steak without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After gulping down several sips of water, Daniela barely subdued the gnawing urge to vomit that threatened to overcome her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander poured water for her, his brows knit together with concern. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Did the ride over here make you carsick? You&#39;ve always been susceptible to it, even as a child, always complaining about the smell of gasoline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander continued to fill her glass, his eyes followed Lillian whisking the steak away. He noted the subtle easing of Daniela&#39;s discomfort, and a shadow crossed his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing close beside her, he observed her delicate profile now shadowed by a touch of vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand, previously relaxed at his side, slowly balled into a tight fist.</p>
