                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile sent a sharp pang through Katrina&#39;s heart, causing it to skip erratically. Recoiling, she asked, &#34;Why are you smiling like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serene composure, Daniela gently wiped her lips with a napkin before responding nonchalantly,&#34;Because you&#39;re being a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt a flush of embarrassment heat her cheeks.Surrounded by a sea of reporters, the sting of being publicly ridiculed as foolish was too much. She yearned to snap back fiercely but, catching the eyes of the crowd, her resolve melted into tears of frustration instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her visible distress instantly softened Caiden&#39;s heart.He glared at Daniela, accusation sharp in his tone.&#34;You&#39;re exploiting our desperate need for this treatment to inflate the price, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile remained unfazed, a picture of tranquility and poise-a stark contrast to the visibly perturbed Katrina and the incensed Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring their accusations, Daniela turned gracefully to the assembled reporters and began to outline the  journey of their heart repair technology-from the early stages of research, through substantial investments in equipment, to years of meticulous experimentation, and finally, the modest yet significant breakthroughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, imbued with conviction and transparency,resonated with the reporters, touching them with the evident passion and challenges her team had faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our institute&#39;s dedicated professors have devoted their lives to this project. Don&#39;t they merit some acknowledgment for their dedication? Isn&#39;t it right to honor their hard work and sacrifices appropriately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her poignant words resonated deeply with everyone gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters and onlookers, stirred by her plea,responded with vigorous agreement, their voices echoing in solidarity, &#34;Absolutely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s features softened, a mixture of relief and sorrow playing across her face. Her eyes, brimming with tears yet unshed, met the camera lenses. &#34;Initially,we intended to present this research at a grander affair. Yet, circumstances have compelled us to proceed otherwise. The sheer scale of investment in this technology is astronomical-top-tier equipment,legions of engineers, and endless nights dev/oid of sleep. Is it unreasonable, then, to seek 300 million for  treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it isn&#39;t!&#34; the crowd roared back, some attendees visibly tearful, moved by her heartfelt words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then fixed her intense gaze on Caiden. &#34;Mr.Harper, do you still consider it expensive?&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s hand tightened into a fist, every muscle straining as if he was fighting the urge to unleash hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it expensive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing 300 million would stretch Harper Group&#39;s finances to their limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it excessive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The funds would be his own-undeniably, it was a hefty sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela had expertly swayed the crowd,turningthem into her staunch allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The term &#34;expensive&#34; almost escaped his lips, but he restrained himself, keeping it unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face was a mask of seriousness, her eyes methodically scanning the audience. &#34;I never planned to air personal grievances in such a public forum,yet here we are, surrounded by onlookers and the integrity of our research institute hanging in the  balance. As many of you are aware, Katrina is my stepmother, and Joyce is my stepsister. Over the years, they have basked in opulence, whereas I was ostracized. Harper Group, my mother&#39;s legacy,seems forgotten. I often ponder-would my mother regret her choice in a partner if she witnessed this today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s reaction was one of utter disbelief. He pointed to Daniela, his voice shaking. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced the audience again, her smile tinged with bitterness. &#34;I&#39;m suggesting that everything changed with my stepmother&#39;s arrival. I was sidelined as others reveled in the fortunes that were rightfully mine. And now, after all my endeavors and successes,Caiden and his scheming spouse seek to strip it all from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion overwhelmed Daniela; she clasped her chest,her voice breaking from the strain. &#34;Tell me, does justice even exist anymore? Or is this world just one big pile of shit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian advanced, placing a supportive hand on Daniela&#39;s shoulder, addressing the gathered reporters &#34;You all know Ms. Harper rarely justifies her actions Yet today,circumstances have driven her to these extremes. Her father has disowned her; her quest for justice rests upon your shoulders!&#34; Daniela flicked her hand dismissively. &#34;Come on, Lillian,let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, standing tall yet imbued with a subdued grief,assisted Daniela as they made their way to the elevator.</p>
