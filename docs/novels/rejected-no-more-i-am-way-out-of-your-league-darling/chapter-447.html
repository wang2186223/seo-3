                <p>Natalie waited in silence, starting to wonder if the call had been disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked her phone, relieved to see it was still connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Mom,why are you silent?&#34; Elyse&#39;s silence was strange. But Natalie was too caught up in the thrill of what seemed like an unbelievable stroke of luck to notice. She laughed, her voice full of energy.&#34;Mom,tell me! Did you sign something with Daniela? Did she give you shares of Elite Lux? Speak up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence from the other end continued,stretching on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a lengthy pause, Elyse&#39;s slow response came.&#34;What? Of course not. Why would that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie furrowed her brows. &#34;No?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elyse had been paying attention,she would have noticed the surprise and subtle disappointment in Natalie&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Of course not,&#34; Elyse affirmed. &#34;Why would Daniela be so generous as to give me shares in Elite Lux? It&#39;s world-renowned and a leader in its field. Why would she give me anything? Natalie, you&#39;re thinking too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her phone. her tone turning icy as she listened to Elyse. &#34;Are you absolutely sure Daniela didn&#39;t give you shares in Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse answered firmly, &#34;No,she didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pressed further, &#34;What about other things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled. &#34;Oh, my dear! How could that be?Does Daniela have so much money that she doesn&#39;t know what to do with it? Why woula she offer me anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked down, her gaze falling. &#34;Did you sign anything with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse responded, &#34;My dear, what&#39;s got you so worked up? What could I have signed with Daniela? Well,I did bring a few Harper Group contracts for her to sign earlier, but that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hung up the phone. She knew her mother well -whenever Elyse was lying, she would unconsciously say &#34;my dear.&#34; She had said it twice duringtheir call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was sufficient to confirm that the agreement was genuine, and the Elite Lux shares were indeed transferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why was Elyse keeping it from her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was certain her mother understood the immense effort she had invested in those matters. She had endured harassment from Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had seen everything unfold herself, yet chose to keep the acquisition of Elite Lux&#39;s shares hidden. What could be her reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Elyse take pleasure in her suffering?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t stop herself from silently blaming her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage boiled within her, threatening to unravel her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later, the city construction bidding meeting was scheduled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela attended the auction and told Natalie, &#34;Tell Aunt Elyse to meet me at the bidding site.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still upset from the past few days, Natalie frowned at the request. &#34;Did you just say you want my mother to attend the bidding meeting as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Yes. Is there an issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had a sinking feeling, suspecting it was related to those contracts. &#34;My mother knows nothing about bidding, and tonight&#39;s auction is under Elite Lux&#39;s name.What&#39;s her involvement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at Daniela, but she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growing sense of unease washed over Natalie. She went with Daniela to the bidding event. Before they got there, Natalie saw Elyse, impeccably dressed.waiting by the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped out of the car.Elyse greeted her with surprising enthusiasm. &#34;Daniela, you made it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, ever the woman of few words,simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, unbothered and unusually sweet, remarked,&#34;This land is massive, hundreds of acres. I heard it would cost over two hundred billion to acquire.Daniela, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit excessive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes gleamed with unmistakable greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;As long as it pleases you, Aunt Elyse.&#34; Elyse&#39;s joy was unmistakable, her face glowing with excitement,practically bouncing in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood off to the side, squinting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t seem like Daniela was there to bid for the land:it felt more like the land was already Elyse&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bidding was fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The land, located in a prime city spot, attracted many property companies. Elyse sat  with the representatives, her eyes wide, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emotions were running wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the realm of the wealthy, where money was little more than a game. The bids climbed past one hundred and fifty billiordollars</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse glanced at Danieia, who had yet to place a bidand asked, &#34;Daniela, in&#39;t it time to join in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, and to Eyse&#39;s surprise, she raised thebid, &#34;Two hundred bilion,&#34; she announced</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her mouth, all eyes turnedto Danieis</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face fushed bright red with excitement. Shoreveled in the attention, straightening her back, herexpression smug as she looked down on the crowd</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in her mind, the land was already hers, without adoubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Daniela successfully secured the land fortwo hundred and thirty bilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela made the payment, Elyse beamed withdelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the payment was completed, Daniela left thescene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse lingered at the site, reluctant to leave. soaking inthe admiring glances from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood nearby, her eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled Elyse aside, asking sharply, &#34;Mom, tell me the truth. Does the land Daniela bid on tonight have anything to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shot NNatalie a disapproving look. &#34;My dear, how could this land possibly have anything to do with me?What are you always thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pressed further, &#34;Then why are you so excited?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s annoyance grew. &#34;Am I not allowed to be happy? Do you have a problem with me living well?Weren&#39;t you the one who blamed me for Brylee&#39;s death before? Let me tell you-without Brylee,I can still make my own way and build a successful future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie asked, &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse opened her mouth to respond, but then remembered the agreement with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved her hand dismissively. &#34;Nothing at all.You&#39;re reading too much into it. I&#39;m just Daniela&#39;s aunt.What could she possibly give me? Could she give me the land she just acquired? My dear, what kind of fantasies are you having?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had once again slipped into calling her &#34;my dear&#34;multiple times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,have you really decided to keep secrets from me, your own daughter?&#34; Natalie&#39;s tone suddenty turned cold as she stared at Elyse.</p>
