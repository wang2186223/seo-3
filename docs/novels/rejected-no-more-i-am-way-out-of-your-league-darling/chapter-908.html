                <p>Nikolas nodded. &#34;Yeah, once the car&#39;s here, I&#39;ll have the driver take them away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon nodded in understanding. &#34;So it&#39;s just the two of us staying behind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused mid-motion. &#34;That&#39;s right. Dad only arranged for the driver to get me, you, and Cedric out-just the three of us. Let Cedric, Daniela and Carol leave. We&#39;ll stay put.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both he and Damon were part of the McCoy family.No one would dare cross that line and kill them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nikolas struggled to piece everything together.How had a few harsh words turned into all-out chaos? Still, his mind was made up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Carol sat quietly as Nikolas approached. &#34;Go pack your things.&#34; Carol slowly looked up, meeting Nikolas&#39; eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas explained, &#34;My dad called. My uncle&#39;s guJards are coming tonight. You need to leave, right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had always expected the McCoy family to take drastic measures, but Nikolas&#39; words still surprised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a little while ago, he&#39;d acted like none of this was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stayed silent for a few seconds before saying,&#34;Your dad doesn&#39;t really care what happens to me or Daniela. He just wants you and Damon out safely,and maybe Cedric if there&#39;s room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed it perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a tight nod. &#34;You three should get out.Damon and I will be fine. We&#39;re part of the McCoy family. No one&#39;s going to kill us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol tilted her head, voice flat. &#34;Is that so? Because the information I&#39;ve got says the hit&#39;s scheduled for midnight, no exceptions. Everyone&#39;s a target. That&#39;s the same intel your dad received, right? Otherwise,he wouldn&#39;t have been in such a rush to send someone to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol met Nikolas&#39; gaze, her voice cutting straight to the point. &#34;Why are you doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, Nikolas was asking himself the same question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d always been the type to steer clear of danger,mocking any kind of reckless bravery. Yet here he was,choosing to stay behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked away, discomfort written all over his face. &#34;Just go, Carol. Get out of here while you still can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause followed before Carol spoke again.&#34;You two plan on staying here to act as decoys, don&#39;t you? The attackers won&#39;t know at first. Maybe they&#39;ll figure out you&#39;re part of the McCoy family after the shooting starts, and you&#39;ll only get injured. But what if they don&#39;t realize it in time?&#34; Carol fixed Nikolas with a hard look. &#34;You could die.Tell me, Nikolas, why? You&#39;re the last person l&#39;d expect to risk everything. What&#39;s making you take this risk all of a sudden? Why pull Damon into this,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, fists clenched, unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol studied the turmoil on his face for a moment before turning her attention back to the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said quietly, &#34;You&#39;ve never been the type to throw yourself on the line for someone else. Stop pretending to be a martyr. That&#39;s not who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about Carol&#39;s steady, unaffected attitude only made Nikolas&#39; anger boil over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you always been like this?&#34; His voice grew louder, frustration bleeding through every word as he gazed at Carol. &#34;Is life or death always so meaningless to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That jab actually stung Carol, even if she didn&#39;t  let it show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand hovered midair with the remote, then she turned to him, eyes steady. &#34;Is that what this is about? You think I crossed the line with Mason?Nikolas, aren&#39;t you terrified of me? Why bother worrying if I make it out alive? What am I to you,really? What gives you the right to get involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas exploded, unable to contain himself. &#34;Exactly!I&#39;m nothing to you, so I can&#39;t tell you how to live! lf you want to throw your life away, go ahead. Why do you always act like nothing matters? Didn&#39;t you say you don&#39;t care about anyone? But people should at least care about themselves, shouldn&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weren&#39;t most people supposed to be selfish? So why would she go so far for Daniela? Why destroy Mason for her sake? Did Carol ever stop to consider the fallout? Or was it just because it was Daniela,and nothing else mattered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t even pinpoint why he was this upset -just that the anger wouldn&#39;t let him go, tearing away at his usual self-control. Carol studied Nikolas&#39; flushed face and wild eyes,watching as his composure unraveled. Slowly, she let her gaze drop. After a quiet beat, she asked, &#34;Why are you so angry, Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol dropped the remote on the couch and walked slowly over to Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas towered above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol folded her arms, chin lifted as she met his eyes. &#34;So, tell me-what&#39;s really got you so worked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned playful, a subtle smirk curving her lips. She remained collected and cool, while Nikolas was a mess of tangled emotions. If this were a battle,Carol had already claimed victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize you could actually die, right?&#34;Nikolas&#39; voice trembled with urgency. &#34;Doesn&#39;t that scare you at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t break eye contact, closing the distance between them. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid. Are you afraid for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words seemed to strike a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened, caught off guard. He tried to speak,but only managed a tight swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t wait, taking another step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflexively, Nikolas backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol closed in once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas retreated, flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped from Carol, light and amused.&#34;Funny. Seems like you&#39;re more terrified of me dying thanlam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharpened, searching his face for answers.&#34;Why is that, Nikolas?&#34;</p>
