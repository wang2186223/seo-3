                <p>Daniela passed the phone over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a quick look before his brows knitted tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned in for a peek. &#34;It&#39;s an unrecognized number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stated, &#34;It&#39;s Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else in the car stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went on, &#34;He underwent plastic surgery. His face is identical to Cedric&#39;s now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grasped it at once. &#34;That report from before!No wonder Richard said Alexander vanished. He was getting surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, still confused, blurted, &#34;Why would he make himself look like Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric skimmed the phone number, passed the device back to Daniela, and smirked, reclining lazily in his seat. &#34;Obviously, because I&#39;m irresistible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied Cedric&#39;s carefree attitude and smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was even bolder than she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once home, Daniela headed for a shower. Cedric eyed the bathroom door, grabbed his phone, and stepped onto the rooftop to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mose, find out who owns this number. Track Alexander&#39;s mnovements. And assign a team to guard my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>C</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end responded sharply,&#34;Understood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s phone rang from the bathroom. Russell was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Joyce didn&#39;t contract us to abduct Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paid Lone Wolf, offering 800 million dollars.&#34; Daniela hesitated briefly. &#34;Did Lone Wolf take the job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell confirmed, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela questioned, &#34;Didn&#39;t you inform their leader that Cedric is one of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell laughed, &#34;Daniela, you forgot. Lone Wolf&#39;s leader changed five years ago and we don&#39;t know the current one. Now they&#39;re openly our rivals. Should we take action?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela showed little concern. &#34;Just ensure Cedric&#39;s safety. Nothing else matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell agreed. &#34;Right, 800 million is small change.But wasn&#39;t there talk of Lone Wolf disbanding? Why are they back in business? Feels odd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ordered, &#34;Investigate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she added, &#34;Investigate the new leader of Lone Wolf. Identify who they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Russell ended the call, Daniela received a message from Lillian. &#34;Come downstairs after your  shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from her shower, Daniela spotted Cedric waiting on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was eager for a child, but Daniela slippoed on a coat, smiling. &#34;Lillian needs me for something.I&#39;ll be back in thirty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric could only wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, slightly confused, approached Lillian.&#34;What&#39;s going on? I only have thirty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian hesitated for a moment before saying, &#34;Don&#39;t spoil Cedric too much. He&#39;ll become impossible to _handle. Once you have a child, he&#39;ll never let you out of his sight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, unfazed. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian informed her, &#34;A group of people have been staying around the villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian added, &#34;I spotted someone familiar, Mose from Lone Wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela inquired, &#34;Why are they here? Ah, I get it...They accepted the contract-eight hundred million to abduct Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Who&#39;s throwing around that kind of money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kidnapping wasn&#39;t murder. This was about claiming Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gestured upstairs. &#34;Does he know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up. &#34;It&#39;s minor. No need to inform him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian smirked knowingly. &#34;Someone spent eight hundred million just to snatch Cedric. That&#39;s some serious devotion. Looks like you have competition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent. &#34;Not many can afford that kind of money. I&#39;ll find out who.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sum like that wouldn&#39;t go unnoticed in the banking system. Daniela reached for a laptop and started typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of her eye, she noticed someone descending the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood on the staircase, gazing at her with feigned sadness. &#34;Your thirty minutes are up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed, handing the laptop to Ryan. &#34;You take over the search.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian folded her arms, mildly irritated at how Daniela indulged Cedric. She remarked pointedly, &#34;Daniela&#39;s busy. Cedric, maybe be a little considerate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s chest swelled with pride as Daniela ascended the stairs.&#34;Why would I?&#34;</p>
