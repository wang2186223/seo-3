                <p>Nikolas froze for a moment, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela in disbelief, while she stayed perfectly calm and collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between his shock and her steady composure, it was hard to say who really had their vulnerability laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know?&#34; Nikolas asked,eyes wide with surprise as he fixed his gaze on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded calmly. &#34;If you&#39;re going to make a move,hurry up. My lunch break&#39;s nearly over, and if I&#39;m late,Cedric will come looking for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said this while taking a casual sip of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked confused.&#34;Aren&#39;t you scared of blood?You know I&#39;m onto your weakness,yet you still come here? Aren&#39;t you afraid of what I might do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until then, Nikolas hadn&#39;t made up his mind yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t deny he&#39;d long coveted McCoy Group and naturally saw himself as the rightful heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ready to dedicate his entire life to achieving  that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had always been his mindset,unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now,with everything laid out plainly, he hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt almost absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only spent less than two months with Daniela and the others, but already, he found himself questioning whether the &#34;put interests first&#34; rule he&#39;d lived by for years was really the right path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood bag lay tucked in his pocket, yet standing face-to-face with Daniela, a wave of panic washed over him,freezing his every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela propped her chin on her hand, studying his face carefully. &#34;Opportunities like this don&#39;t come around often. Are you really going to let it slip by?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hadn&#39;t shown up. Nor had Carol followed. Just as Daniela said, this was the perfect opportunity for Nikolas. Still, he stood frozen, fists tight, eyes unfocused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tapped Nikolas&#39; chest where the blood bag was tucked away. &#34;Just so you know, it doesn&#39;t last forever.After thee days, it lose its potency. If I&#39;m not mistaken, today&#39;s the third day. If you don&#39;t act now.  it&#39;ll be useless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited a moment longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face flushed deep red, his thoughts tangled in chaos.Daniela observed him quietly, noticing he still made no move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose and said, &#34;If you&#39;re not going to do anything,I&#39;ll be heading back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she walked to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she reached the door, Nikolas suddenly called out, &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped and looked back at him, confusion clear in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew all along what I planned? Why didn&#39;t you call me out, making me look like a fool? Is that some kind of joke to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled at his words. &#34;Do you think I would risk my life just to prove what kind of person you are?If that&#39;s what you believe, then you&#39;ve seriously underestimated both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas frowned, bewildered. &#34;Then why? You know my ambitions, how I&#39;ve always wanted McCoy Group.Why take such a gamble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;Because I want Cedric to have</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone dependable by his side, no matter what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned. &#34;Just for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pure intentions caught Nikolas off guard. &#34;Why..me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled gently. &#34;Because you&#39;re clever,because you&#39;re part of the McCoy family, because you share half of Cedric&#39;s blood, and because I want his path to be filled with warmth. Only then will my risk today be worth it. Nikolas, I hope you won&#39;t let me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she walked awvay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sank onto the sofa, eyes vacant as he stared at the empty doorway. Slowly, he pulled the expired blood bag from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, he had been defeated by Daniela&#39;s affection for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who claimed she was cold and indifferent, keeping Cedric merely as a plaything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had clearly buried her true feelings in the deepest corner of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela reached her company,Cedric was already waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was grim, and when he saw Daniela casually wave at Hamilton by the floor-to-ceiling window across the hall, his face darkened further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled at Cedric. &#34;Why are you upset? It&#39;s nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still unsettled. &#34;Why did you go alone? You know how ambitious Nikolas is. No one can predict what he might do. You&#39;re risking everything, and that&#39;s unlike you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, allowing him to voice his concerns,fully aware of how deeply worried Cedric was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took his hand gently and led him inside the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed on, &#34;Hamilton won&#39;t back down. We have to get rid of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela guided him into the elevator. &#34;We&#39;re decent people. Why must we always speak of fighting and killing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at Daniela, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;tshe the leader of Cealmaur? And now she wished to avoid bloodshed and battle?</p>
