                <p>Breathing hard, Hamilton hurried off to find Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office door burst open, making Josh jump and turn. When he saw Hamilton, some of the worry still lingered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt something was off, and his heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh quickly hid his panic, smoothed his thinning hair, and acted surprised. &#34;Hamilton? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes and stared at him. &#34;Josh, what are you scared of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sat back at his desk, crossing his legs. &#34;Me? Scared? What could possibly scare me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton squinted and sat down across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave a small nod to his secretary, who quietly left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton noticed every detail. He gripped the armrest tighter. &#34;Josh, I just happened to be nearby. When are you sending the rest of my money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I already explain?&#34; Josh said, looking away briefly. &#34;There&#39;s a limit on transfers. You&#39;ll get the rest in a few days. Why the hurry? With a company this size and major projects, do you really think I care about your pocket change?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s fingers dug into the armrests. &#34;Josh, we&#39;re family. I&#39;ve had a lot of respect for you, but I hope you&#39;re not fooling me. I didn&#39;t make a fuss when you took money from McCoy Group, but you know we don&#39;t have much money left. We&#39;ve been at the top for years, living comfortably, but we never really spread out our investments. We are all depending on this money to get by. If you&#39;ve cheated us, that&#39;s mnore than wrong -it&#39;s disgraceful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton held Josh&#39;s gaze as he spoke openly Josh&#39;s lips tightened into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton pressed on. &#34;Josh, just tell me thetruth. Is there something wrong with this investment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stayed quiet. He slowly looked up at Hamilton. Just then, the office door opened and the company&#39;s accountant walked in, carrying a stack of documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their quiet standoff was broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh came back to himself and laughed. &#34;Hamilton, why are you always so doubtful? There&#39;s nothing wrong with this investment. I put my own money in too. Why would I hurt myself? You&#39;re just being paranoid again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh smiled. &#34;Look, the company accountant&#39;s here. I was just about to ask him to start your transfer.Hamilton, it&#39;s no surprise you can&#39;t keep up with Daniela-you&#39;re far too suspicious. Just go home.The money will be in your account by the time you arrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at Josh for a moment, then slowly got up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hamilton reached the door, Josh called out, &#34;Hamilton, you&#39;ve always been sharp-with business,people, strategy. Dad favored me, sure, but | always wanted to earn something on my own, making him proud. I&#39;ve always felt overlooked. How am I any less than you? I just wanted to prove I could do something too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the large office, Josh&#39;s voice came out sounding years older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clenched his fist and said quietly, &#34;You didn&#39;t have to prove anything. In Dad&#39;s eyes, you were always the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went quiet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father&#39;s favoritism hung over them like a steady, cold rain-one that some never escape from, no matter how long they try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let go of the armrest, stood, and stared through the tall window as Hamilton left the building. With a breath of relief, he turned to the accountant. &#34;How much is left in the account?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accountant&#39;s voice shook. &#34;Less than a million. It&#39;s all tied up in the investment. We can&#39;t get in touch with the firm. People in Oiscoll are catching on-word&#39;s spreading. They&#39;ll know soon it&#39;s a huge scam.What do we do, Mr.McCoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stumbled, barely keeping his boalance. He leaned against the window, his voice rough. &#34;Check if there&#39;s any money left we can shift to pay Hamilton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accountant looked close to crying. &#34;Mr. McCoy, we&#39;ve already moved everything we could. There&#39;s nothing left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accountant stared at Josh&#39;s back and shouted, &#34;Mr. McCoy, you need to flee right now-before it&#39;s too late!&#34;</p>
