            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Daniela&#39;s impulsive urges were tempered by reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in her tracks, her eyes locking onto Natalie, whose features mirrored her own. A subtle smile appeared on her lips. &#34;Natalie, it&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, a top-tier graduate with international experience, stood in stark contrast to Nina. She radiated a confident, composed aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a remarkably young age, Natalie had founded a publicly traded company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, my mother sent me to help you,&#34; Natalie said, her smile calm and confident. &#34;I majored in Finance and minored in Law, with additional studies in Psychology and Investment Banking. I believe I can be a more effective assistant than Lillian. I&#39;ve prepared a workflow diagram based on Nina&#39;s tasks. Please take a look, and if it suits you, we can begin today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s tone carried an undeiable air of superiority,her confidence evident. Though she framed it as a suggestion, there was an underlying tone of authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, usually quiet and obedient, couldn&#39;t help but feel dwarfed by Natalie&#39;s presence. There was no denying that Natalie&#39;s professionalism was both commanding and efficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced between the two women.&#34;Alright.Natalie is competent and reassures me. You two can handle the details. I&#39;m off for a morning run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela left the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way, she received a message from Ryan.&#34;Natalie just returned!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded,&#34;I saw her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? She even visited you? I believe she had something to do with what happened to your mother back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Brylee had been manipulated by a psychologist Katrina had brought in. The only reason the psychologist had been allowed to stay in the house was because Natalie had claimed to have feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had persuaded Brylee to let him stay.Otherwise, someone as cautious as Brylee would never have allowed an outsider to remain in her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Katrina was the direct instigator, Elyse and Natalie were the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes. Before leaving the villa, Daniela took one last look behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky above was heavy with an impending storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick with the scent of rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weather mirrored the day Brylee had died in an almost eerie way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all felt as though destiny had orchestrated these moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows began to surrender the faces of those who caused Brylee&#39;s death, and Daniela vowed to hold every one of them accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated in the villa&#39;s plush sofa,Natalie surveyed her surroundings with an air of ownership, her tone dripping with condescension. &#34;Mom says you&#39;ve been quite the rebel lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood to the side, feeling herself shrink under Natalie&#39;s domineering presence. &#34;I&#39;m just going after someone I care about. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s wrong,&#34; she retorted after mustering her courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a frigid laugh. &#34;Ridiculous. If this house lacks a mirror, perhaps you should seek one elsewhere.Even if Cedric were completely blind, he wouldn&#39;t spare you a second look. In terms of looks, intellect,or capability-do you genuinely believe you&#39;re on the same level?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lip. &#34;I won&#39;t give up until the end. Love isn&#39;t always won by the most capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina clung to the belief that she still had a chance.After all, not every affluent man was drawn to domineering women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And even when it comes to talent, you don&#39;t measure up to Daniela,&#34; Nina added, refusing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s confident demeanor cracked instantly. &#34;How dare you!&#34; she snapped, the words striking her raw nerve. Her lifelong failure to outshine Daniela had always been her most painful insecurity. &#34;Nina, are you trying to provoke me? I might not touch Daniela, but making you pay would be far simpler.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina clamped her mouth shut, knowing it wasn&#39;t wise to push further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom&#39;s plan is to remove Daniela, marry me to Cedric,and elevate our family to the top. You&#39;d do well to cooperate-or don&#39;t blame me if I show no mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s threat hung in the air. Nina bit her lip. &#34;Cedric might not even fall for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Cedric&#39;s name, some of the tension left Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had nursed feelings for Cedric since their school  days, and her celebrated return after a flourishing career abroad had been fueled by her long-held yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was resolved to win Cedric&#39;s affection and revive the dreamshe&#39;d clung to for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overflowing with confidence, Natalie fixed Nina with a cold stare. &#34;You will assist me,&#34; she declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the villa, Natalie made her way to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had informed her that Cedric, who had arrived the previous night, was in Daniela&#39;s private lounge at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Natalie swung open the office door and found Cedric standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, looking flawless in his tailored suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of him sent her heart racing, as if her lifelong ambition had just stepped into reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his composed posture, Cedric exuded the effortless elegance she remembered, his quiet dignity bathed in the soft glow of morning light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth rose to Natalie&#39;s cheeks. Clearing her throat,she addressed him. &#34;Cedric.&#34;</p>
