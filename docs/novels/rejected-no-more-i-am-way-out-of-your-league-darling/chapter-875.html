                <p>Hamilton was well aware that blood bags had a limited shelf life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, he saw Daniela leave for Nikolas &#39; company, and excitement bubbled inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even popped open a bottle of champagne to celebrate prematurely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Daniela was out of the picture, Cedric would marry the princess of Loglil, and Hamilton could enjoy the spoils without any effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could savor his victory, Daniela returned unscathed,spoiling his plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his face to the window, peering out multiple times to confirm-yes,Daniela was back safe and sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even gave Hamilton a teasing wave, sending his blood pressure soaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas,you good-for-nothing fool!&#34; he growled,reaching for his phone to call. But at that moment,his own phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the king of Loglil on the line. The king&#39;s tone was stem and commanding. &#34;Is Daniela really divorcing Cedric or not? You claimed their marriage was falling apart so why aren&#39;t they divorced yet? Do you believe my daughter has no other suitors and must wait for Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hurriedly responded, &#34;It&#39;s underway, but you know how tricky property divisions are here. Please be patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The king&#39;s voice hardened. &#34;You better be honest. If you stall my daughter&#39;s future, there will be consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton assured him again and again, plotting his next step. &#34;I&#39;d never do that. I&#39;m keen to see this marriage through. It&#39;s in progress. Cedric will attend an upcoming opening ceremony.If your daughter wishes.she can come see Cedric up close. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had a scheme brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heart of a young woman was a wild card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the princess took a liking to Cedric, she&#39;d naturally convince her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she was interested, Hamilton&#39;s chances would rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call, Hamilton&#39;s secretary asked cautiously,&#34;Inviting the princess over? Cedric isn&#39;t exactly warm to women besides Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sneered. &#34;What do you know? Men are all alike. Cedric&#39;s good looks and the princess&#39;s grace-if they cross paths and Cedric takes a fancy to her,l won&#39;t need to lift a finger. Cedric will end things with Daniela all by himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Hamilton picked up his phone to call Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the call, Hamilton erupted in anger. &#34;Are you completely useless? Can&#39;t you handle such a simple job? What am I supposed to rely on you for? What does McCoy Group get from you? All my years of effort have been wasted. Nikolas, you&#39;re a failure.worthless! I&#39;d rather give away all the McCoy family&#39;s assets than hand you a single centl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Withthat,Hamilton slammed the phone down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gripped his fists tightly, standing motionless for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Nikolas dialed the PR manager.&#34;Put out an announcement for me,&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager was taken aback by Nikolas&#39; directive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, if you go ahead with this, you&#39;ll be officially cutting all ties with the McCoy family. We&#39;ve only just started turning a profit. Doing this could scare off partners and clients. Forget profit-the company might not survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gazed at the busy street below. &#34;Do it. I&#39;m certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager sighed deeplyand left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Sunrise Company issued a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In response to recent rumors concerning our CEO Nikolas McCoy and Hamilton McCoy, we clarify to prevent any misunderstandings. Sunrise Company has no ties to McCoy Group. We officially declare Sunrise Company as an independent entity. Our CEO has cut all connections with Hamilton McCoy and will no longer use any McCoy family links or resources.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was stunned upon reading the announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious,he barged into Nikolas&#39; office and slapped him in front of all the staff,shocking everyone and completely severing Nikolas&#39; final ties to the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas came back,humiliated, the sting of the slap mark still fresh on his face. Damon spotted him and gave a thumbs up. &#34;You&#39;ve got guts. I was nearly scared out of my mind. But was it really necessary?The announcement was crystal clear.How do you plan to use McCoy Group&#39;s ties going forward?&#34; Nikolas retorted, &#34;I want to see how far I can go by myself.I want to mnake my own choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to be like his brothers, whose marriages were tightly controlled and suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed for someone who would love him as deeply as Daniela loved Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas stepped into the villa, Carol passed by.caught sight of his face, paused, and turned back.&#34;What happened to your face? Who hit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pressed his lips shut, staying silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked at Daniela. &#34;Nikolas got hit. There&#39;s a big slap mak on his face. You should go check on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Didn&#39;t you dislike him? He bought you food,and you didn&#39;t even eat it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol said, &#34;That&#39;s because he once tried to hurt you.But now he&#39;s changed. That makes him a decent person. Go check on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela moved over to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas feIt a bit embarrassed. &#34;It&#39;s nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded and said to Carol, &#34;You heard what he said,didn&#39;t you? He said it&#39;s nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced at Nikolas&#39; handsome face and frowned. &#34;Hamilton is ruthless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Nikolas. &#34;You just stood there and took the slap? Next time,tell me-I&#39;ll slap him back for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pulled out a cake.&#34;Want some?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded eagerly.&#34;Yesl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood nearby, teasing Cedric, &#34;I want to eat a cake tool&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly replied,&#34;r&#39;ll buy it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric&#39;s phone buzzed with a message from Hamilton. &#34;There&#39;s an opening ceremony. I don&#39;t want to see Daniela right now,so you should go instead.&#34;</p>
