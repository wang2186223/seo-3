                <p>The meeting unfolded in the cafeteria on the first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, fresh from leading a conference, treated herself to a bowl of pasta, savoring each bite with a serene composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merely a few paces from her, Caiden and Katrina found themselves hemmed in by a quintet of imposing security guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice carried a cool detachment as she addressed them. &#34;If you have something to say, make it quick. You&#39;ve got ten minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression blended shock and pain. &#34;Daniela,is this how you treat your own father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed, Daniela continued to ate her food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through her meal, she asked casually, &#34;Did you take that document severing our relationship as nothing more than a joke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden opened his mouth to respond, yet words failed him. Daniela pressed on, her tone unyielding. &#34;After you exploited our last shred of familial ties to secure a position for Joyce,why pretend there&#39;s a fence left to mend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, attempting to diffuse the tension, chimed in with an overly bright smile. &#34;Come on, that was just a family spat. Sometimes people say things they don&#39;t mean in the heat of the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? That agreement is upheld by the law,&#34;Daniela retorted, her voice slicing through the air.&#34;You&#39;re both well beyond the age of such jokes. If there&#39;s something pressing on your minds, state it clearly. Don&#39;t waste my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela&#39;s face, seeing echoes of Brylee in her features, and his eyes narrowed with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Just give me the cardiac-repair medicine.Then I&#39;ll go,&#34; Caiden declared, clenching his teeth as he felt his dignity being eroded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina maintained her sweet demeanor, her smile unwavering. &#34;Daniela, since it&#39;s clear you&#39;ve stripped all sentiment from this equation, we shall not owe you any favors. Just name your price, and we&#39;ll settle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately raised her voice, making sure the media clustered at the door caught every word,  painting Daniela as ruthless and opportunistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina&#39;s words hung in the air, Daniela flicked a glance towards her before turning her eyes to the media throng at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched an eyebrow and allowed a small, knowing smile to play on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the perfect moment to unveil Dreamscape&#39;s latest breakthrough to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Daniela responded evenly. &#34;We indeed possess the treatment you&#39;re inquiring about, and if you&#39;re prepared to meet the cost, that&#39;s agreeable to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,seizing the moment, leaned closer to Caiden and murmured conspiratorially, &#34;Told you, didn&#39;t l?Daniela&#39;s all about the money-nothing else matters to her. She&#39;d overlook even the bonds of family for profit. Once she states her price, let&#39;s skip the haggling. We&#39;ll manage it, for our baby&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina spoke with defiance, as though completely unafraid. She meant every word, or so it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden responded with a look filled with gratitude and whispered tenderly, &#34;Katrina, marrying you was the best decision of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Radiating warmth and serenity, Katrina smiled at him.In her mind, the cost wouldn&#39;t be steep; after all,how  expensive could the medicine be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted was to ruin Daniela&#39;s image completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela dared to take money for the medicine,Caiden&#39;s wrath would be absolute, and public opinion would cast her as the ruthless villain who turned her back on her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Katrina&#39;s eyes, her strategy was foolproof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three hundred million,&#34; Daniela declared, placing her fork on the table. Her gaze met Katrina&#39;s. &#34;Transfer that sum to Dreamscape, and you&#39;ll get the medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina froze, her expression one of sheer disbelief.&#34;How much did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three hundred million,&#34; Daniela reiterated firmly,maintaining eye contact. &#34;What&#39;s the problem? A moment ago, you appeared quite eager. Does this mean you don&#39;t value a human life at three hundred million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smug smile that had been playing on Katrina&#39;s lips suddenly stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you dare push it! We&#39;ve bought medicine before, and there&#39;s no way in hell it costs that much!&#34; She strode towards the entrance, signaling to the gathering reporters. &#34;See this for yourselves,everyone. Daniela&#39;s trying to extort money from us.  Three hundred million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a subtle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That twisted smile made Katrina&#39;s blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all things, nothing terrified her more than seeing Daniela grin like that.</p>
