                <p>The entire world seemed to pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s ears picked up only one thing-his heart pounded wildly, beyond his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela parted her lips to speak, a breeze swept past, bringing with it a familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, strong arms wrapped around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a friendly embrace-it was desperate,as if he had just reclaimed something irreplaceable.The unspoken fear was palpable, letting go meant losing her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood frozen, utterly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at Carol, silently asking, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pressed her lips into a tight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitantly grasped Cedric&#39;s suit, her voice a soft whisper. &#34;Cedric, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no response. Daniela pursed her lips. &#34;Maybe you should let go.There are a lot of people watching, and this isn&#39;t exactly proper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she spoke, Cedric&#39;s body trembled ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he stepped back, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. His voice was soft, fragile.&#34;How have you been these past three years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiarity in his tone made Daniela feel a bit awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent a silent plea to Carol, who quickly stepped in,gently pulling Cedric aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela, disbelief etched into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol motioned to the side. &#34;A word please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With visible hesitation, Cedric forced himself to look away and followed Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with emotion, he had momentarily forgotten everything else. But the moment he took a step and caught Daniela&#39;s gaze flicker towards his leg,a sharp ache shot through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he turned back to her. &#34;It&#39;s fine. It doesn&#39;t hurt anymore.&#34; Then, he faced Carol again. Thirty minutes passed, and Cedric still hadn&#39;t said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Carol, disbelief clouding his eyes. It all felt surreal-impossible yet there was no flaw in what he&#39;d just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice wavered. &#34;Are you telling me my wife lost her memory?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;Not long after you ran into the fire, the explosion happened. Ryan and Lillian followed, trying to save you both, but they didn&#39;t make it. Daniela had assigned Shadow to protect you.When the blast went off, Shadow got both of you out, but Daniela hit her head against a wall. She had been in a coma for three years and only woke up a few days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then sighed. &#34;This will be hard to hear but you need to know-she doesn&#39;t remember you,your marriage, or even the baby. To her, she&#39;s just divorced Alexander. Right now, you&#39;re nothing more than an old classmate to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the weight of those words could settle, a figure suddenly rushed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Alexander&#39;s face lit up with excitement.&#34;Daniela lost her memory? Great!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nearly laughed out loud. Could there be any news more perfect than this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did this mean he had another chance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years without her, regret had gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated how he had taken her for granted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated how blind he had been during the divorce. If only he had recognized his love for Daniela sooner,she might have never ended up with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time these thoughts surfaced, regret gnawed at him,stealing his sleep and leaving him restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, this was his chance to rewrite everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Daniela,they had just divorced; this meant she still felt something for him. Fate was giving him a do-over</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time,he wouldn&#39;t let her slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement pulsed through him, so much so that,for a fleeting second, he almost felt grateful for the explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught the smug look on Alexander&#39;s face and let out a dry scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She addressed Cedric with measured politeness. &#34;We hope you understand why we kept Daniela&#39;s condition from you. The situation was uncertain, and we had no idea who might still be a threat to her. Losing Ryan and Lillian was devastating for all of us. For the past three years, Daniela remained in a coma. She only just regained consciousness, and the doctors strongly cautioned us against bringing up the past. The loss of her unborn child, Ryan, and Lillian could overwhelm her,risking another breakdown or relapse.We ask for your understanding.&#34;</p>
