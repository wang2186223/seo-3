                <p>The car stopped in front of a grand villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse managed a tight smile, speaking to Daniela with hesitation.&#34;Wllwe should be going now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the door handle, but the car door wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised, she glanced back at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s face was hidden in the shadows, Elyse&#39;s heart skipped a beat. After a long, tense pause, she finally asked, &#34;Daniela, why won&#39;t the car door open?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only response was silence-an unnerving, heavy silence that filled the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s shock deepened as her hands, resting on her knees, began to tremble.&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlights outside flickered to life with a sudden snap, revealing Daniela&#39;s cold, striking face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s heart tightened once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she felt as though Daniela knew everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She desperately wished it was just her imagination running wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Elyse was about to speak, unable to endure the silence any longer, Daniela&#39;s soft voice cut through.&#34;Aunt, this villa you&#39;re living in now was bought by my mother, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the lights outside flickered on, illuminating the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, your mother gave it to me as a gift. She knew how tough things were with my in-laws and offered this villa as a form of future support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her gaze drifting towards the grand villa at the heart of the residential area. &#34;I recall you managed to divorce your ex-husband without much hassle and secured custody of both children, all thanks to this villa, am I right?&#34; Elyse, unsure of why Daniela had raised this topic, felt a mix of anxiety and fear. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m very grateful to your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft light touched Danielá&#39;s face, and Elyse hoticed a sarcástic smnile appear on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced as she watched Daniela. She asked,something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered quietly, &#34;No, just thinking about my mother. She had a tragic end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse paused for a moment, then let out a strained sigh.&#34;Ah,yes...&#34; she replied, her throat tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt, do you still remember what my mother looked like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse replied, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled faintly. &#34;But I can hardly remember. I was so young back then. Despite my efforts, her image slips away a little more each day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was speechless, unsure of how to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she opened her mouth, Daniela went on, &#34;I really envy Natalie. She still has her mother with.her.Even without a partner all these years, you&#39;ve done a great job raising two kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse couldn&#39;t quite tell if Daniela was offering praise or criticizing her. She could only look at Danielprofile,lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, the car door clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse placed her hand on the door handle. &#34;We&#39;ll be going now. Natalii1let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, with Elyse&#39;s emotional awareness, she would have said something comforting, but the events of the night had left her too shaken. She needed to escape the heavy atmosphere as quickly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car door swung open, allowing the cold wind to rush in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse pulled her coat tighter around her and prepared to step out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt, do you think Caiden was right? Was my mother really murdered?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was soft but piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in that instant, Elyse froze completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head snapped around in shock, staring at Daniela, unable to believe what she had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who had been staring out the window, now faced her, her cold gaze locking onto hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her red lips parted slightly as she asked, &#34;Aunt, if it was murder, who do you think killed my mother?&#34;</p>
