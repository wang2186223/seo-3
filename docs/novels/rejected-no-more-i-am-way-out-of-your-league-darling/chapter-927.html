                <p>The secretary had been right all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word had already reached the McCoy family that Daniela had purchased a pregnancy test, and the entire family erupted in chaos-far worse than the chaos during the last stock market crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me this is actually happening?&#34; Josh could barely keep his composure. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely sure it was a pregnancy test? She didn&#39;t just pick up cold medicine or something like that? Did anyone verifý this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His subordinates exchanged uneasy glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no mistake, sir. Daniela entered the pharmacy first. Hamilton&#39;s people followed right after. Once everyone had cleared out, we went in and spoke with the clerk. She confirmed the woman ahead of us bought a pregnancy test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To drive the point home, one of the men reached into his pocket and produced a slim box. &#34;We even asked the salesperson to give us the exact same prodúct,just to be certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family crowded around, peering down at the unmistakable words stamped across the package: Early Pregnancy Test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood vanished from Josh&#39;s face as he snapped,rage boiling over, &#34;Daniela&#39;s pregnant again? Can anyone explain how this keeps happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad spoke up, voice heavy with gloom. &#34;Boy or girl, 1wonder? Before our father died, he said whoever gave him the first great-grandson would inherit McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; glare swept over his daughters-in-law irritation radiating from him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the whole room went quiet, the tension thick enough to choke on. One of Josh&#39;s men finally spoke, breaking the silence. &#34;Daniela took the test and went home. Just now, we got word-Hamilton is on the way to her place.Probably there to confirm whether it&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s temper flared the instant the words hit his ears. &#34;What are we waiting for? Let&#39;s go check for ourselves. Maybe it&#39;s just a rumor-nobody gets pregnant that easily. For all we know, it&#39;s just a case of the stomach flu!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, once weighed down with dread, now stirred with cautious hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! Just because she bought a pregnancy test doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s actually pregnant. Maybe even Daniela&#39;s not sure heself. Didn&#39;t she lose a child a few years back? She&#39;s never exactly been someone who gets pregnant easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood shifted-optimism began to ripple through the group. &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, a convoy of cars tore off toward Daniela&#39;s villa.The drive didn&#39;t take long. Hamilton, who had been organizing an entire truckload of nutritional supplements, ended up waiting a little while, so when he finally rolled up, the rest of the McCoy family had just pulled in too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, nearly bursting with impatience, managed to keep himself in check when he spotted Hamilton among the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the swarm of people, then allowed a smug smile to slip across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look at that-everyone&#39;s here already? You all couldn&#39;t wait, huh? Josh, didn&#39;t your daughter-in-law just give birth? I heard she&#39;s still in the hospital.How&#39;d you even find time to show up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason was disabled, while his wife had just given birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the family knew Josh had pinned all his hopes on this new baby. But it turned out to be another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in the McCoy family ever dismissed daughters; every child was celebrated. But with eighteen girls in the youngest generation, the absence of a single boy gnawed at everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes gleamed red, envy smoldering beneath his stony expression, while Hamilton&#39;s self-satisfied taunts made his jaw clench in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, the secretary caught Hamilton&#39;s smug little act and smirked quietly to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Hamilton even grasped how little ground he&#39;d ever won against the McCoy family. This family, masters of playing dumb,bled every advantage dry while wearing innocent faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s blind spot had always been his fondness for them, and they&#39;d milked it for all it was worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the only card he had left was banking everything on Daniela&#39;s influence.</p>
