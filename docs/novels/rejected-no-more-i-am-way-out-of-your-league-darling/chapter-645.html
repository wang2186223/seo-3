                <p>Upon hearing that, Daniela exchanged a meaningful glance with Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught on quickly. With a cold smile, she advanced ahead of Daniela towards Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd looked on, confused. Why had Carol moved to the front?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained next to the security barrier,appearing detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the onlookers could react, they heard Jack,who was on his knees, shout to Carol, &#34;Aunt Daniela,you finally came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assembly was stunned into silence. All eyes turned to Jack, their expressions filled with astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person nextto Jack stooped down, pointing at Carol, and asked Jack, &#34;What did you call her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was sure he had it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never met Daniela before. Joyce had loathed Daniela,likely never showing Jack her picture. As everyone watched, Jack clung to Carol&#39;s leg,exclaiming, &#34;Auntie, you&#39;re here at last! I missed you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol feigned a smile and responded, &#34;Oh, really? You missed me? Then stand up. You look so pitiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jack tried to catch a glimpse of Joyce, the bustling crowd had already nudged her away. He had to get to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her teeth clenched, Carol bent down slightly.&#34;Why were you seeking me out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack tilted his head while looking at Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized the woman standing before him didn&#39;t seem as intimidating as his mother had painted her to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling somewhat relieved, Jack said, &#34;I&#39;m aiming to get into a private school. Can you assist me with that?I&#39;m your dearest nephew,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol scoffed, &#34;Indeed. Didn&#39;t your mom say that you would sleep with my photo every night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack nodded eagerly. &#34;Yes, and that&#39;s why l recognized you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was adept at acting cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He draped his arms around Carol&#39;s neck, endearing  You..himself to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers remained hushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the peculiar scene unfolded, they shared a collective thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman whom Jack affectionately addressed was not Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack didn&#39;t know what Daniela looked like!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Joyce&#39;s public declarations of her warm relations with Daniela were entirely fabricated?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A realization struck everyone simultaneously.Joyce was not a Harper. She and Daniela didn&#39;t have any blood ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had set fire to Daniela&#39;s wedding, ruining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their relationship was strained, to say the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Daniela was unable to have children, Joyce&#39;s pretense of warmth was merely a ruse to secure an inheritance for the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s faces lit up with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, Carol addressed the boy clinging to her neck. &#34;But I&#39;m not your auntie. She is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured towards someone standing behind her. The crowd turned to follow where Carol pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack grinned awkwardly. &#34;Oh, I was only kidding! |know who is my auntie! Auntie, I missed you so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then reached out towards Daniela&#39;s secretary,feigning warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers were dumbstruck by the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy confessed his mistake so effortlessly,revealing his knack for deception-it was clear he was no stranger to lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s secretary hugged Jack, she questioned him teasingly, &#34;Are you certain I&#39;m your auntie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack snuggled into her embrace, maintaining his act.&#34;Absolutely! I know for sure you&#39;re Aunt Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assertion only deepened the silence that had fallen over the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce was outside, bragging to the press.When the noise from the crowd abruptly ceased, she grew concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elbowing her way through, she said, &#34;Jack, stop mingling with them. Just wait here for your auntie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, taken aback to see Jack in the arms of another woman. The crowd&#39;s gaze shifted to Joyce, watching her confusion grow. Moments later, Jack, still in the secretary&#39;s arms, pointed at her and told Joyce, &#34;Mom,look,Auntie is hugging me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce grabbed Jack from the woman&#39;s arms and stared coldly at Daniela, who stood at the doorway smirking. &#34;Playing games with a child, Daniela? As an adult, you should know better. You&#39;ve distressed him.How will you compensate him?&#34;</p>
