                <p>Daniela felt a quiet sense of satisfaction as she offered a faint smile. &#34;Oh, really? I wasn&#39;t planning to get involved, but since you kept pushing, what else did you expect from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s complexion turned ashen. &#34;Do you even care about your family? It&#39;s just a small portion of shares! Joyce won&#39;t have anything to do with managing the company, so it won&#39;t affect you. And yet,you still refuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, her voice steady.&#34;That&#39;s correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was momentarily speechless. He didn&#39;t want to drag the conversation on, but the idea of Joyce getting married without any support or assets from her family seemed unthinkable. He could already picture Katrina&#39;s fury once they returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was completely out of options-Daniela was his final hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in his life had he imagined that, after all these years,it would come down to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, his expression began to soften. &#34;Daniela,whether you admit it or not, I&#39;m still your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a mocking smile. &#34;Oh, is that supposed to guilt-trip me? Let me remind you-l lost my mother when I was five, and at the same time, I may as well have lost a father. I feel nothing for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gave a tired nod. &#34;What about your mother,then? What about the love between your mother and me? How do you justify ignoring that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, attuned to Daniela&#39;s slightest changes,noticed a subtle shift in her demeanor. He turned to look at her. She still seemed calm on the surface, but something in her eyes struck him-a deep,almost undetectable hatred that sent a chill through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I wouldn&#39;t bring this up if I weren&#39;t truly at the end of my rope today,&#34; Caiden started, his tone carrying an unusual weight of sincerity. &#34;I know you&#39;ve always held me responsible, believing me to be cold and heartless, but | want you to know-l genuinely loved your mother. She had many suitors,but she chose me because I treated her with care and respect. When her company was gearing up to go public, she pushed herself relentlessly, and I was there,staying up with her night after night. I didn&#39;t let the servants take over the household chores-not because they couldn&#39;t, but because I didn&#39;t trust them to do it right. When she was pregnant with you,I read every book on prenatal care. By the time you were born prematurely, even the nurses admitted was more knowledgeable than they were. You were both in fragile health, and it was me who nursed you both back to strength, step by step. I gave it everything I had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice trembled with emotion as tears streamed freely down his face. Daniela remained seated, her expression a perfect mask, hiding any trace of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden continued, &#34;From the time you were one until five, I was the one who made sure the water you drank at school was just right. When your mother&#39;s skin became sensitive with the changing seasons,l was the one who cared for it. And every time she came home late from those social events, I was always there at the door, waiting for her, day in and day out. Daniela, I&#39;ve worked hard, truly hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina listened, her face showing a mix of emotions.She&#39;d never been on the receiving end of such intense attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained stone-faced. Slowly,she rose from her seat and told her secretary, &#34;Please show them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned on her heel and made her way to the door. Caiden quickly stood up, knowing these words might not always get the result he hoped for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was aware that Daniela wouldn&#39;t soften towards him, but perhaps there was still a chance for Brylee&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee represented the one thing in Daniela&#39;s heart that could still be touched-an irreplaceable softness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, please! If not for me, then for the years l spent caring for your mother-help me out of this mess. Just five percent of the robotics company shares, that&#39;s all | ask!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela didn&#39;t stop. As she continued walking away, a sudden loud sound echoed behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and turned around, her eyes landing on Caiden, who was kneeling in the middle of the office.Tears of regret streamed down his face as he pleaded, &#34;Daniela, this is my apology to your mother.I failed her. I cared for you, I held you close. Now,I beg you. Please have mercy!&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice rang through the empty office, heavy with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze fell on Caiden, her eyes distant as if she were looking past him to the version of him she had known before she turned five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face remained icy as she spoke with finality. &#34;I&#39;ll give Joyce the shares, but now on, you will never speak of my mother again-not a single word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was frozen for a moment, taken aback by her words. After a long pause, he finally muttered,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that by offering the shares, Daniela was cutting all ties between him and Brylee for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just like when Daniela allowed Joyce to join Elite Lux-it would cost him their father-daughter relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment on, Daniela never referred to him as her father again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, once a decision was made, there was no space for regret. It was final-no further entanglements, no second chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, out of respect for Brylee, Daniela had stil offered him a shred of kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after today, they would be nothing more than strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his fists, a bitter ache settling in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legal team from Elite Lux worked efficiently,soon bringing in the contract for him to sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden could sign, the lawyer asked, &#34;Mr.Harper, are you sure about this? Once you sign, it&#39;s final.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated for a moment, his mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, standing by his side, urged impatiently, &#34;Sign it! Five percent of the robotics company shares-that&#39;s a fortune for us!&#34;</p>
