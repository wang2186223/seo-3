                <p>The eight of them exited the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno frowned, utterly perplexed. &#34;What&#39;s Alexander playingat? Helping us for nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow spoke, arms crossed. &#34;No way. He wants us to take down Cedric for him. He just makes it sound like he&#39;s doing us a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey turned to Hackett. &#34;Hackett, what&#39;s the move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s expression remained cold and unreadable.&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice. Either we go along with this,or we wait to go bankrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s voice hardened. &#34;Starting tomorrow, we attack Phillips Group from all sides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before leaving,Winslow glanced back at the cafe,a nagging feeling creeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice inside didn&#39;t sound like Alexander. Who else could it have been? He couldn&#39;t place it just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight of them spent the night strategizing. By the time the stock market opened the next morning, Phillips Group&#39;s shares took a sharp dive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the day&#39;s end, they had plunged to a historic low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric returned to Phillips Group, working to contain the fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied the stock chart, her gaze darkening with every dip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood behind her, arms crossed. &#34;They&#39;re smarter than I gave them credit for-targeting Cedric instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy tension radiated from Daniela, sharper than ever before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Nina, after a quick glance at her, instinctively took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina whispered to Lillian, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian smirked, casting a knowing look at Daniela.&#34;She&#39;s pissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina rarely saw Daniela lose her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she was indifferent to most things,except Cedric. This was the first time Nina had seen her truly upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what happens now?&#34; Nina asked, barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out a low chuckle. &#34;Someone&#39;s about to regret their choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina turned to her,wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traditional industries moved at a different pace than Daniela&#39;s company, which thrived on rapid profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They depended on raw materials, labor, fluctuating markets, and customer demand. In short, too many variables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight members of the commerce association had deep-rooted connections within the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They leaned heavily on those ties, which kept them afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Phillips Group, the pressure mounted from every direction, crises piling up one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association members, watching Cedric struggle,finally exhaled in relief, applauding Alexander&#39;s cunning strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Hackett sent Richard a rare antique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard beamed with satisfaction. Alexander was just as pleased. Once Phillips Group collapsed, Cedric would have nothing. Then, he could take Cedric&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wanted to step in and help Cedric, but he insisted he could handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,for the next few days, she stayed on the sidelines,watching. And just as he promised, Cedric pulled through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to leave it be for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man&#39;s pride had to be respected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Cedric didn&#39;t want her interfering in. Phillips Group&#39;s affairs, she continued to target the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Hackett and his group sat drinking, basking in their supposed victory. Soon, Cedric would surrender, and they could negotiate with Daniela on their terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno exhaled in relief. &#34;For a second, I thought we were actually done for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey wiped the sweat from his forehead. &#34;No kidding.That was brutal. If there&#39;s one lesson here, it&#39;s that Daniela is not someone to cross.&#34; Marcus gave a knowing nod. &#34;True, but luckily, Cedric is her Achilles&#39; heel. Without him,she&#39;d never back dowvn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp scowled, swirling his glass. &#34;Even so, we took a massive hit. Next time, the membership threshold needs to be raised. We need to recover those losses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno sneered. &#34;Daniela should be the one paying for it! Who does she think she is, acting so high and mighty? At the end of the day, she&#39;s just a woman. If I get the chance, I&#39;ll make her regret ever challenging us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey nodded, his voice dripping with disdain. &#34;She thinks she can avenge her mother&#39;s death? She should&#39;ve died with her! The moment we get the chance, we&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s out of the picture for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s expression darkened at those words. &#34;You&#39;re underestimating her. Daniela has some serious connections. Plenty of people want her gone,yet she&#39;s still standing. That should tell you she&#39;s not as easy to take down as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey scoffed,rolling his eyes. &#34;Connections? So what?At the end of the day, she&#39;s just one person. No matter how powerful she is, when it&#39;s her turn to die,she&#39;ll beg for mercy like everyone olso.&#34; Laughter erupted around the table, their voices</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brimming with arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Hackett&#39;s phone rang. Still smirking, he answered, leaning back in his chair. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others watched as his confident grin slowly stiffened. Then, in an instant, it vanished, replaced by pure terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hackett&#39;s shaking voice filled the air, the rest of their phones started buzzing with notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breaking news alert flashed across their screens,the headlines bold and damning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scandal of Women Abuse at Graves Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett&#39;s Three Daughters Are Adopted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Graves Group&#39;s Charity for Poor Girls Was a Front for Grooming Them for Future Gains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shocking! The Collapse of Graves Group&#39;s Public Image!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s fingers shook as he clicked on the first article, dread tightening in his chest. A recording of Hackett&#39;s conversation with Cedric in the study had gone viral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the audio, his voice rang out clearly.&#34;As part of the deal, my three daughters will be at your disposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Women are worthless by nature-you can&#39;t let them think they&#39;re special. Keep them locked away, cut off from the world, make them need you for everything.That way,you can do whatever you please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s words played from the phone, his tone cold and calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other seven people present stared at Hackett in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno slowly rose to his feet, his voice sharp. &#34;So, you went behind our backs and met with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s lips curled into a bitter smile. &#34;You told me your eldest daughter was the perfect match for my son. Said they should get engaged after Christmas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus narrowed his eyes. &#34;You were the one who made it clear-no one was supposed to contact Daniela or Cedric alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey let out a scornful laugh. &#34;Hackett,you really are something else. Trying to make a secret deal with Cedric? Looks like he played you instead.&#34; Hackett stumbled back a step, his face pale. Disbelief flickered across his features, then dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had built his empire in the entertainment industry,where the illusion of female empowerment was a gold mine. But with this scandal, every actress, model, and brand tied to him would be dragged down as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Graves Group was spiraling towards disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, under the cover of darkness, Hackett visited Alexander again, his hands full of extravagant gifts.</p>
