                <p>Thirty minutes later, Katrina came back. She stormed through the door, fixing Caiden with a withering look before scolding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uninvited, you impose yourself at Daniela&#39;s dinner table. Humiliated for a mere meal, how do you justify that? Serves you right! Caiden,you&#39;re not a young man anymore. How could you let her humiliate you just for the sake of a meal? If she were willing to give you her attention, that would be one thing. But she doesn&#39;t care about you, yet you still think there&#39;s some lingering father-daughter connection between you? It&#39;s absurd! Can&#39;t you see the truth, Caiden?She no longer sees you as her father. She texted me in the middle of the night to settle your bill,threatening to cut Joyce&#39;s shares in the robotics company if I don&#39;t. If you&#39;re so troubled that you&#39;re dragging your daughter into your mess, why not take the same path as Brylee? Spare others the pain!&#34; Having vented her frustration, Katrina angrily sent a thousand to Josie, grabbed her suitcase, and ascended the stairs, leaving Caiden standing there,nothing more than a cold, unfeeling silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the living room, Daniela turned to Caiden with a smirk. &#34;Do you remember how my mother died?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face turned pale at her question. He ran upstairs, his footsteps erratic, almost tripping over as he ascended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life for Caiden grew more suffocating from that day forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Katrina&#39;s return, their relationship deteriorated further; she found him increasingly unbearable, and her verbal assaults intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, Caiden reached out to Alexander,using his influence to secure a few minor deals for Harper Group. He then begged Daniela to transfer the profits from these deals to his account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, Caiden ventured into business independently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several initial setbacks, he finally secured some contracts through Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having never encountered significant professional obstacles in his earlier years, Caiden now faced them head-on. Often returning home intoxicated from networking events, he found the bedroom locked by Katrina and resigned himself to sleeping on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was busy scrutinizing a business proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Caiden stirred from his uncomfortable sleep, dawn was breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained focused on her work at the dining table while Caiden lingered in the living room, his gaze fixed on her. For a fleeting moment, he imagined he saw Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to speak, but his words caught in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization hit him; he didn&#39;t know how to face Brylee. She had entrusted Daniela to him, expecting him to cherish and protect her. Yet, he had let her down,failing both as a spouse and a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under his watch, Brylee&#39;s once prosperous company had declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shame was too much for him to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood motionless for a while, gradually sobering. He then moved to the kitchen, warmed some milk, and set it next to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from Cedric you&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping. This milk&#39;s from your fridge, but it&#39;s on me.Have some; it might help you rest,&#34; Caiden said,placing a hundred-dollar bill next to the mug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up from her work. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why turn down a simple act of kindness? It&#39;s just milk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been reading all night, her eyes showing signs of strain. She blinked and then resumed wearing her anti-fatigue glasses. &#34;Can we drop the act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a sting from her cold tone. &#34;I&#39;m not acting. I saw you were tired and thought the milk might help. Why would you think I have ulterior motives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile, her attention returning to the documents, though she seemed less interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long understood that she must rely on herself in this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up from her reading, Daniela spoke.&#34;I&#39;m beyond the point where small gestures affect me. I wear a coat if it&#39;s cold, and turn on the air if it&#39;s hot. I&#39;m fully capable of looking after myself. I don&#39;t need you, got it? To me, anything unnecessary is just an act. Keep your money and give me space, or l might have to ask you to leave to spare us both any unease. Perhaps then, you&#39;ll grasp the true cost of losing what little dignity you have left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face was etched with sadness as he looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, she remained the joyful little girl who once hugged his leg, but she had grown so distant and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regardless of what you believe, I truly wish to do right by you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained expressionless, offering no reply to his heartfelt plea.</p>
