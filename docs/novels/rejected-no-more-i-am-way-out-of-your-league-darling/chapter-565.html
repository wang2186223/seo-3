                <p>Alexander let his gaze linger on Daniela&#39;s face before it unintentionally drifted to her abdomen. It was a brief moment before he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, perhaps I should go with you to the hospital? Stomach troubles are not to be taken lightly,&#34; Alexander suggested, his tone laden with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela headed for the door, replying dismissively,&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. I already have a family doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander trailed her to the staircase, his eyes following her departure, continuing to stare long after she had disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Norton, come here,&#34; Alexander commanded with gravity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?&#34; Norton Truman  asked promptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still have that cousin working at Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from Norton confirmed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I need him to monitor Daniela&#39;s health closely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norton&#39;s expression clouded with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander instructed, &#34;Check if she&#39;s pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was, he would need to tamper with her food to prevent any possibility of a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela belonged to him alone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she ever had a child, it would be his and no one else&#39;s!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of her bearing a child that wasn&#39;t his filled him with a violent jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this turmoil was Joyce&#39;s doing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Joyce not interfered, he would never have lost Daniela. The secretary observed a frightening malice flash in Alexander&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a dark villa basement at night, Joyce lay bloodied and barely conscious in a pool of her own blood.Alexander, finished with his brutal assault, tossed the whip aside with scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then stepped on Joyce&#39;s face, pressing down with his shoe. &#34;You liked the scent of blood, didn&#39;t you? Well, now&#39;s your chance to indulge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shoe pressed hard against Joyce&#39;s blood-streaked face, as he said coldly, &#34;Joyce, your end is deserved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night dragged on, filled with the harsh sounds of a whip cracking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling nearly lifeless, Joyce was barely conscious when an elderly man intervened, pulling Alexander away by his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mocking sneer, Alexander departed without looking back. In the dim light, Joyce, battered and weak, secretly grasped a small shard of glass in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had just walked out of Alexander&#39;s hotel,when she got a piece of news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had returned as a celebrated international actress. She had headed straight for Elite Lux,insistently asking to meet with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern etched on Lillian&#39;s face as she fretted over Daniela&#39;s well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;Have her come to the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging with a nod, Lillian recalled that Cedric was currently away, tied up with resolving financial upheavals, thus leaving their residence unoccupied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After arriving home, Daniela was about to refresh herself with a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before going to the bathroom, she turned to Lillian and instructed, &#34;Call Elyse over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela, her voice tinged with concern. &#34;Won&#39;t it escalate the situation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile widened. &#34;Exactly, what a spectacle it will be to watch them clash!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Lillian agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from her shower, Daniela descended the stairs to find Natalie already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie now exuded with the poise and presenceof a movie star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her time abroad, Natalie voiced a character in a critically acclaimed animated film, connected with a top director, and skillfully secured a role in a blockbuster movie. Her return was marked by significant media attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now established by international fame and swollen with pride, she had become bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no hidden agendas, Daniela. I aim to re-establish my career here. You control several entertainment outlets. Hand one over to me; I&#39;ll manage it,&#34; she said boldly. Daniela quietly filled a glass with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alternatively, allocate some resources to me. I&#39;ve learned that your company holds the rights to Ultimate Kung Fu. I want the lead role in that movie,&#34;Natalie continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grasped the full extent of Natalie&#39;s ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimate Kung Fù, a martial arts epic, featured a love story that challenged traditional boundaries. The protagonist was a heroic and stunning woman,battling sinister forces with bravery and virtue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made the ultimate sacrifice, staying true to the justice she cherished until the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This pitiful conclusion left countless fans longing for a film version wwhere the heroine might find a happier fate alongside her beloved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement of the film&#39;s production had drawn the attention of many renowned actresses, all eager to secure the lead role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of this desired opportunity, Natalie had made her way back to the country specifically for this purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she mentioned the role nonchalantly upon arrival, seemingly taking for granted Daniela&#39;s potential unawareness of the film&#39;s deep significance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could only smirk in response. Clearly, Natalie had underestimated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her gaze to the guest room, Daniela said, &#34;I&#39;need some time to consider this.&#34;</p>
