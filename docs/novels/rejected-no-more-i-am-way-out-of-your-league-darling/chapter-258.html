                <p>Daniela, feeling sleepy, couldn&#39;t suppress a smile. &#34;Did Ryan take Lillian out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed, pulling her closer. &#34;Yeah, she was being stubborn. I almost didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it here tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed her eyes, a smile curling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric suggested, &#34;Can&#39;t we just make it public? Not even to Ryan or Lillian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nestled deeper into Cedric&#39;s arms, seeking warmth. She feared the cold, and his embrace brought comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was used to sleep in his arms now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan can know, but if Lillian hears about-it with her big mouth, the entire world will know. I still have things to sort out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than the rumors about their relationship, she feared people uncovering her weaknesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come upstairs tomorrow. I can handle sleeping by myself,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But when I&#39;m not here, you never sleep soundly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela often struggled with sleep, finding it hard to rest deeply. In the past, she would turn to Cedric&#39;s puzzles, working on them until she was tired enough to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she realized that with Cedric beside her, she could finally sleep soundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stopped doing puzzles altogether, and the ones scattered on the floor hadn&#39;t been touched in over two weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just now, she felt a little tired, but still, sleep wouldn&#39;t come easily. Daniela sighed to herself, marveling at how quickly habits could shift. In just half a month, her insomnia, which had lasted for years, seemed to have improved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d eventually fall asleep,&#34; Daniela murmured, her voice drowsy, as her breathing evened out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,on the other hand, was still waiting for Cedric&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime, she had gone back home once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going back to your parents&#39; place again?&#34; Richard asked, his tone indifferent as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t entertain him and replied curtly with a simple &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Daniela&#39;s robotics company paid out dividends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a scornful snort. &#34;Yes, they did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard looked down on Joyce&#39;s arrogance. His friends were curious about the amount of the first dividend from the robotics company. Since Joyce held a small stake, Richard didn&#39;t pay much attention when he asked about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce curled her lips into a smirk. &#34;Three million last time, and another three million this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Richard felt a surge of unease. &#34;Is that the total amount distributed, or what you actually received?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gave Richard a look of pure disdain. &#34;Are you serious? A company as large as a robotics firm-how could three million be enough for everyone? I&#39;m just a minor shareholder with no say in the company. How would I know the total distributed? That&#39;s the actual amount I received.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she said this, Richard&#39;s eyes brightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hadn&#39;t done a thing, yet just because Caiden had knelt to Daniela that time, she somehow struck it rich--six million just like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had the chance, Richard wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kneel as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly,he wasn&#39;t fortunate enough to have a daughter like Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips tightened in frustration. If Alexander hadn&#39;t chosen to divorce Daniela because of Joyce, Richard would be the one on top in Olisvine today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more he loathed Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anger deepened as he remembered how she had manipulated things to turn against Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce then headed upstairs, slipped into an outfit that screamed confidence, and left the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed, she didn&#39;t even spare him a glance, her arrogance unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,irritated,wasted no time complaining as soon as Alexander walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of woman did you marry? She&#39;s acting like I&#39;m not even her father-in-law. Don&#39;t you see that,Alexander? Daniela&#39;s robotics company is raking in the cash, and Joyce is acting so smug about it. She even told the servants she won&#39;t be back for dinner. I&#39;m telling you, Joyce has some dangerously ambitious plans.You&#39;d better keep an eye on her, or she&#39;ll end up causing a scandal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander set his briefcase down, his attention elsewhere. &#34;The company is brand new. How much could they possibly distribute? A few hundred thousand, at most. Joyce might splurge on a couple of inexpensive bags, but that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Richard dramatically raised his fingers.&#34;Joyce claimed they distributed this amount. They did it last week and again this morning. Looks like Daniela&#39;s business is quite successful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced at his fingers and fell silent, contemplating for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not possible,&#34; Alexander muttered as he hung his coat. &#34;Her company hasn&#39;t been around long enough to distribute that much. Everyone knows tech startups need heavy investment, and it takes years before they even break even. There&#39;s no way they could give out so much so soon.&#34;。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remarked, &#34;Joyce let it slip this morning. She can&#39;t keep anything under wraps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander retorted, &#34;She has to be lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard didn&#39;t respond further. The atmosphere became heavy with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give Raul a call. He made a small investment,&#34; Richard said as he dialed the number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was answered promptly, and Richard went straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul clicked his tongue twice. &#34;You&#39;re well-informed, Richard. The funds just came in this morning, and you&#39;re already in the loop. Daniela certainly knows how to run a business. Have you heard the gossip?</p>
