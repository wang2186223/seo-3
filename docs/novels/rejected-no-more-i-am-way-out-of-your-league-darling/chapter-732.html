                <p>Cedric returned home, his eyes instinctively drifting toward the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t there watching TV as she usually was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, the housekeeper was busy preparing a meal. Sunlight spilled through the windows, wrapping the room in a cozy glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the sound of the door, the housekeeper stepped out. Spotting Cedric, she greeted him warmly.&#34;Mr.Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Daniela come back yet?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper shook her head. &#34;Not yet. She left early this morning but mentioned she&#39;d be back for lunch. She should be here soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Cedric let out a small breath. The heavy knot in his chest loosened a little. He nodded and said, &#34;Alright.&#34; Crossing the room,he lowered himself into the seat where Daniela usually sat, trying to steady his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, meanwhile, was finishing things up at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive back, Carol sat beside her, looking as though she wanted to speak but hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their car pulled to a stop at the villa entrance, they both caught sight of Cedric through the large glasS window, sitting quietly inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of silence, Carol finally spoke.&#34;Cedric has packed all of his belongings. Are you really sure you don&#39;t want to bring him with you? This isn&#39;t like last time, when illness forced you apart for years. Now, you&#39;re both clear-headed. If you leave him behind, he&#39;ll think you&#39;ve given up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, the warm lights cast a soft glow. From outside, Cedric appeared calm and unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he waited for Daniela, he never fidgeted with his phone, nor glanced around in distraction. He sat upright, still and composed, a patient smile lingering on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, maybe you should rethink this. I heard from his secretary that he&#39;s already tied up every loose end. If you told him you&#39;re leaving tonight, he could walk out with you without missing a step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood just outside the house, silent as stone.After what felt like forever, she finally balled her hands into tight fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet voice, she said, &#34;Go back and fetch my identification documents. I&#39;ve already transferred all of my assets, including Elite Lux, to Cedric. There&#39;s no need to give him the transfer paperwork ahead of time. Hand the documents to Joyce and let her pass them to Cedric tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying her piece, Daniela turned away and climbed into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned, smiling in anticipation, thinking it was Daniela returning. Instead, he found Carol standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned to the side, trying to see past her. There was no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34; Cedric asked at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked away. &#34;There&#39;s a glitch in the company&#39;s system that needs fixing. Daniela went to handle it.She said she&#39;ll be back late, so you don&#39;t have to wait for her at dinner. She also mentioned she has something important to tell you tonight. She wants you to wait at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s doubts melted away. He figured Daniela would tell him tonight that she wanted to bring him along. He never once questioned her words. Not even a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded and headed upstairs to pack the last of his things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun dipped beyond the horizon, Cedric wrapped up every bit of his preparation. He even contacted the professional manager to confirm he would start work the following day. Everything had been arranged perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he came back downstairs, a strange emptiness settled over the villa. Nothing seemed out of place.Yet, a deep unease gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he strode toward Joyce and asked loudly, &#34;Has Daniela come back yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce paused, a water cup trembling slightly in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that split second, Cedric understood everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and rushed to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could leave, Joyce&#39;s voice rang out.&#34;There&#39;s no need to chase them. They&#39;ve aleady left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The schedule had shifted earlier. That afternoon,after Carol picked up the documents, they boarded Elite Lux&#39;s private jet and flew straight to Oiscoll.</p>
