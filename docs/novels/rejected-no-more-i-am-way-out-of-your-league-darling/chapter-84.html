                <p>Standing in the parking lot, Wyatt scowled, his irritation clear. &#34;Why am I the one dealing with Daniela&#39;s mood swings? It&#39;s your wife who couldn&#39;t keep her mouth shut and upset Katrina. How&#39;s that my problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald turned,his disbelief evident. &#34;Not your problem?Are you kidding me? Do you think Katrina&#39;s a fool?She&#39;s as stuck-up as they come, always putting Joyce on a pedestal. Do you really believe she&#39;d go out of her way to ask Daniela to help you? Keep dreaming.Just wait and watch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt let out a heavy sigh,his frustration matching Ronald&#39;s. With so many mouths to feed at home,being jobless wasn&#39;t an option. They&#39;d be drowning in bills. If things weren&#39;t so dire, he wouldn&#39;t have stooped to asking Daniela for a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ronald, do you really think Daniela will help us after all the crap we&#39;ve said about her and her mother?&#34;Wyatt asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t she?&#34; Ronald scoffed, his bulky frame shaking with disdain. &#34;If Joyce can land a cushy job, why not us? We&#39;re her uncles! And if she refuses, I&#39;ll cause a media uproar. She&#39;s a CEO-her reputation matters. She&#39;ll have no choice but to give us something. If Joyce can become a director, we deserve nothing less than a top role, maybe even a CEO gig!&#34; ②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s face lit up, a glimmer of hope flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had stayed at work late that evening. The moment she stepped out of the elevator,she noticed two familiar faces waiting near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The underground parking garage was nearly empty,the silence broken only by the soft echo of her heels.&#34;Do you need something?&#34; she asked and instinctively stepped back into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could close the doors, Ronald&#39;s hand shot out,holding them open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with the hesitation, Daniela? It&#39;s just us-family. We stopped by your office earlier, but you were tied up. Thought we&#39;d catch you here since it&#39;s on your way out,&#34; Ronald said with an overly cheerful grin, keeping the doors from shutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt chimed in, nodding eagerly. &#34;Long day, huh,Daniela? You must be exhausted.&#34; Reaching into his pocket, he produced some snacks he&#39;d pocketed from the waiting room earlier. &#34;Here, have a bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint smile, already calculating her limited options. At this hour, help wasn&#39;t exactly on standby. With steady composure, she stepped out of the elevator and asked, &#34;Alright, what do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald trailed behind as Daniela walked to her car.The moment their eyes fell on her limited-edition luxury vehicle, the two brothers exchanged wide-eyed looks of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A car worth millions, and she treated it like just another ride? The extravagance floored them. ②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the opulence, Ronald&#39;s hopes of securing a job grew even stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling slyly, he said,&#34;Alright, Daniela, let&#39;s cut to the chase. You got Joyce a job, didn&#39;t you? Well,we&#39;re family too. Isn&#39;t it only fair you help us out as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even break her stride at his words. She was already standing beside her car. For a moment,she stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt added eagerly, &#34;Exactly, we&#39;re family! You can&#39;t just favor Joyce. Don&#39;t forget when...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled, trying to recall some past favor they&#39;d done for Daniela, but his mind came up empty. The awkward silence only made his embarrassment worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald gave Wyatt an exasperated look and shoved him aside. Turning to Daniela, he said, &#34;Listen, Daniela,when you were a kid, we were the ones looking out for you. Don&#39;t let money make you forget your family.One day, when you&#39;re in trouble, it&#39;s us you&#39;ll need,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes dropped for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family?Really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered when her mother had jumped off that building. The doctor had asked for help with the stretcher, but these two didn&#39;t lift a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, it was a stranger who stepped in to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The years hadn&#39;t dulled the memory of their cold,disdainful expressions. They were burned into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment when she felt utterly powerless,surrounded by her so-called family. Ronald had whispered cruelly, &#34;Why would she commit suicide?Did she cheat on her husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt had sneered. &#34;Who knows? Always flaunting her fancy clothes and acting so important. Who knows how many men she&#39;s been involved with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, here they were,claiming to be &#34;family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, noticing her silence, decided to play tough.He scowled and said, &#34;Daniela, let me make this clear-we&#39;re not here to beg. If Joyce gets something,we expect the same. If not, we&#39;ll make sure everyone knows how you turned your back on your family.Elite Lux just made its big return, and you wouldn&#39;t want bad press, would you? I know how much people like you value their imnage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald was always full of big talk. He&#39;d spent a few years as a mid-level manager before running his mouth and getting fired. In his mind, his argument made perfect sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt,as usual,just nodded in agreement.</p>
