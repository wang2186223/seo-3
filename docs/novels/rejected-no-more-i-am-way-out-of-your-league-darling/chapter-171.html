                <p>If Daniela had not brought up the past, Caiden wouldn&#39;t have remembered it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now confronted with the undeniable truth, he remained tight-lipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina caught the weight of his silence, her teeth gritting as she realized there was no escaping the task of moving Joyce from her current room today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a contrived tenderness, she turned to Cedric, softening her expression in a bid to seem reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coaxed Daniela in a sugary tone dripping with insincerity. &#34;Daniela, think about what you&#39;re saying.Accusing your father over something as trivial as a room? Very well, if the room means so much to you,consider it yours. Marilyn, would you please start packing Joyce&#39;s belongings and take them out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn, still clutching her cheek, stormed upstairs in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips twisted into a subtle, sconful smile. &#34;I see you haven&#39;t lost your touch. Your words glide as smoothly as ever, and your skin seems thicker than stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were piercing, sharp enough to cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s hand, resting lightly on her lap,curled into a tight fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face held a serene, amiable smile, but underneath, a storm of fury raged within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always known handling Daniela was a challenge. Looking back, she regretted not having killed Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce began to voice her objections, but Daniela&#39;s frosty glare instantly silenced her. With her head bowed,she meekly withdrew to stand behind Katrina, her resolve completely evaporating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, Ryan and Lillian pulled up with a moving van in tow. A flurry of movers bustled in and out,hauling an assortment of furniture and boxes into the house. Katrina watched the procession wih a growing sense of annoyance churning in her stomach.&#34;Really, is afl this necessary? Just look at all these things! Caiden, is Daniela planning to stay here for good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden watched, his face clouding over as he saw movers hauling in a bed, a desk, a piano, and various other pieces of lavish furniture. A wave of irritation squeezed his chest, yet he felt powerless to intervene.With a frustrated snort, he spun around and retreated into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,on the other hand, gaped in astonishment as the movers hauled a brand-new bed upstairs. Unable to contain her frustration any longer, she called out to Daniela, &#34;Daniela, this is absurd! The bed in my room is almost new. Was there really a need to replace it with another?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, leisurely peeling an orange that Cedric had given her, didn&#39;t even bother to glance her way.&#34;l′′ma bit obsessive when it comes to keeping things clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Josie arrived,accompanied by a squad of professional cleaners. She addressed Daniela with deference before ushering the cleaners upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stared in disbelief at the unfolding chaos. She turned sharply, her eyes blazing with fury as her voice exploded. &#34;What the hell is this supposed to mean? They&#39;ve got disinfectant tools! Are you implying that I&#39;m filthy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up from her task.&#34;NO,&#34;she responded flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief washed over Joyce, but it was short-lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m merely concerned that you might be carrying some contagious illness,&#34; Daniela continued, her tone indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, that is beyond inappropriate!&#34; Joyce exploded in outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Daniela met her gaze squarely.′′YS1, I am being inappropriate. So, what are you going to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a question that cut straight to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood rooted to the spot, her thoughts scrambling for a comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she had to accept the hársh reality-she was powetless to change Daniela&#39;s course of actior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the upstairs room was arranged, Caiden and the others thought the chaos was finally over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Daniela&#39;s crew burst into the kitchen, commencing a ruthless dismantling of the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and the others were shocked, their disbelief written all over their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina demanded, &#34;What in the world are you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie,standing confidently with her sleeves rolled up and overseeing the workers, pivoted to face her.&#34;Daniela prefers not to share her kitchen space with you. She requires more room. Thus, we are enlarging this area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to a modest sink nestled in the corner and assured,&#34;Don&#39;t worry, that area is designated for your use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn, who was visibly agitated, advanced with determination, her sleeves also now rolled up in readiness.&#34;Why does she get all this space? Joyce has just welcomed a new baby and needs wholesome soups! How do you expect me to manage in such a cramped spot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not my concern. Why are you bringing this to me? If you&#39;re struggling with your responsibilities,maybe you need to reconsider your position here. Sort it out on your own.&#34; Josie&#39;s loyalty to Daniela was unwavering. Despite her son&#39;s substantial financial success, she had opted to remain steadfastly by Daniela&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She often said that Daniela had faced many challenges in life, and she was willing take care of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, Tyler&#39;s prosperity was deeply intertwined with Daniela&#39;s encouragement and support. Filled with gratitude, Josie had committed herself to always protect and support Daniela.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often, tales about the Harper family&#39;s mistreatment of Daniela would reach Josie through whispers from Ryan or Lillian. These stories invariably ignited a fiery anger within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon learning of Daniela&#39;s return, Josie wasted no time in rushing to her aid, anxious that Daniela might once again fall prey to the family&#39;s cruelty. Her worries were slightly alleviated when she saw Cedric standing protectively by Daniela&#39;s side, yet Josie remained vigilant, her defenses firmly up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn, Katrina&#39;s aunt, had made herself quite at home in the residence. She savored the best foods,claimed a prime spot at the family dining table, and enjoyed the comforts of their lavish home.Now,with her dominance challenged by an outsider, her patience was wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell do you think you are, talking to me like that? This is the Harper family!&#34; Marilyn snarled, her voice trembling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so you do know this is the Harper family?&#34; Josie responded with a piercing, mocking laugh. &#34;That&#39;s amusing. From the way you&#39;ve been comporting yourself, one might assume we&#39;re in your home. You&#39;ve leeched off your employers for so long, you&#39;ve completely lost sight of your actual standing here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn, incensed, drew her hand back, poised to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her hand could meet its mark, the sharp sound of a slap rang out, stopping her in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilyn stood there, utterly speechless, her body rigid with shock. In that moment, the world seemed to mute around her, leaving her enveloped in a disorienting buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shame of Daniela&#39;s slaps earlier was still fresh-a deep, stinging humiliation. But now, struck by a mere servant? It was utterly unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with fury, Marilyn lunged towards Josie, her face twisted in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Josie, with her years of laborious service sculpting her into a formidable force, did not retreat.With a swift and skilled motion, she delivered a series of sharp, echoing slaps to Marilyn, each one leaving her more dazed and unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina noticed the escalating chaos and stepped in, hoping to defuse the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, lounging on the couch with her eyes fixed on the television, finally spoke. &#34;If it&#39;s just the servants quarreling, let them handle it. Katrina, if you interfere, you force my hand as well. And don&#39;t come crying to me if l act against you.&#34; Her casual tone belied the gravity of her words, which seemed to linger heavily in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina halted abruptly, her body quivering slightly with the weight of Daniela&#39;s warning. She found herself unable to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the floor, Marilyn, now subdued and pinned down by Josie, broke down completely. Her cries filled the room as tears streamed down her cheeks. &#34;Katrina! Katrina! Help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, caught in a tumultuous internal struggle, remained still. Her eyes darted from Marilyn, lying battered and crying on the floor, to Daniela, who remained disinterestedly on the couch, seemingly oblivious to the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her jaw was locked with strain, Katrina made the deliberate choice to remain still, unwilling to get involved.</p>
