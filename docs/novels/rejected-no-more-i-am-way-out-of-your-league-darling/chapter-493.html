                <p>Daniela managed a strained smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander moved closer, she abruptly stood,leaving him reaching out to empty space. His expression turned to confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving,&#34; Daniela declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, Alexander stood and grasped her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away, prompting Alexander to ask her anxiously, &#34;Daniela, when will I see you again? Have you considered my previous proposal? It still stands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid she might have forgotten about it, Alexander quickly added, &#34;Remember, if you ever grow weary of Cedric, you can turn to me. You&#39;re drawn to his appearance, aren&#39;t you? Come to me instead. I&#39;m his mirror image, and I ask for nothing more than to be with you. I can become whoever you desire, Daniela.In my world, you are the only one, and that will never change.&#34; Daniela looked at his face, so similar to Cedric&#39;s,yet felt only detachment. &#34;Is that so? I&#39;ll give it some thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face brightened immediately. &#34;How long will you need to consider it?&#34; His eagerness to reclaim her affection was noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resolved not to repeat past mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she consented, he planned to win her over completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to end Cedric&#39;s life for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he would be the sole Cedric in existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela left, Alexander&#39;s gaze hardened with resolve. He silently vowed to win her back,regardless of the sacrifices required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, after satisfying Doug in bed, Joyce headed straight to Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Joyce noticed how absent-minded Alexander was. &#34;You met Daniela, didn&#39;t you?Getting obsessed with her? Remember your commitment to me, Alexander. I invested heavily to turn you into Cedric. Remember, Daniela will be Doug&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander flung back the covers and left the bed. He moved to the floor-to-ceiling window and lit a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce eyed Alexander&#39;s well-defined back,impressed yet again by the surgeons&#39; craftsmanship.Every glance at his face stirred something within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer, pressing against him once more,craving more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander quickly brushed her hand off his chest with a chill detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression darkened with irritation. &#34;What&#39;s this about, Alexander? Don&#39;t think a brief chat with Daniela means you can take Cedric&#39;s place in her heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, are you content to live forever overshadowed by Daniela?&#34; Alexander asked, his gaze cold and his tone devoid of emotion. Taken aback, Joyce paused. She straightened,eyeing Alexander with a calculating gaze as her initial desire weakened. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you truly content with living in her shadow forever?&#34; &#34;Do you really want to depend on Doug for your status your entire life? Natalie wants Doug, or more accurately, his wealth and the title of his wife.How long do you think he will remain faithful to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce scoffed dismissively, &#34;Natalie? She&#39;s naive!She doesn&#39;t know Doug is difficult to handle at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent, his demeanor cold and detached, his eyes as piercing as Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce narrowed her eyes suspiciously. &#34;What&#39;s your angle in saying all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded calmly, &#34;You are Doug&#39;s wife now. Should anything happen to him, you&#39;d inherit everything. That&#39;s when you&#39;ll truly be independent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stared at Alexander, stunned. &#34;You want me to kill Doug?&#34; &#34;There&#39;s no need for you to get involved. I&#39;ll take care of it,&#34; Alexander assured, his plan forming the moment he observed Natalie with Doug earlier.Doug&#39;s sex addiction was his weakness. If he died while having sex with Natalie, nobody would doubt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to do it?&#34; Joyce knew Alexander&#39;s self-centered, cold nature well after years together.He was offering to eliminate Doug for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your price?&#34; Joyce asked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped the room after Alexander&#39;s declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce then erupted into uncontrolled laughter, so intense that she doubled over in pain, eventually collapsing to the floor as she clutched her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander observed her, remaining composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, winded from her fit of laughter, Joyce settled cross-legged on the floor, her voice oozing sarcasm.&#34;Alexander, you&#39;re quite the comedian. Remember how Daniela chased you, and you pushed her away?Now you&#39;re ready to commit murder for her after she&#39;s been with Cedric this long? Isn&#39;t that just ridiculous? Tell me, Alexander, since when did you become so obsessive? Knowing Daniela and Cedric have been intimate, how does that not eat at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s words visibly unsettled Alexander, his facade beginning to crumble, his expression contorting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t get it! This is about love! Love makes you overlook the past,&#34; Alexander said, anger rising in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce saw through his facade. &#34;Alright, you eliminate Doug for me, and .I&#39;ll manage Daniela and Cedric on your behalf. You aim to be the sole Cedric, correct?I&#39;ll help you, but there&#39;s something you need to know first...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce paused, running a finger along Alexander&#39;s changed face. &#34;Cedric must live. I want him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tired of the counterfeit, she wanted the real deal. &#34;In my basement, I&#39;ll chain Cedric up,&#34; Joyce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>declared, her eyes flashing with a wild passion. &#34;I&#39;m eager for that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce grabbed her bag and stopped at the door.&#34;Alexander, don&#39;t get too ahead of yourself. Winning Daniela&#39;s heart won&#39;t be simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;That&#39;s not your concern. Just make sure Cedric is taken care of, and I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m the only Cedric to Daniela.&#34;</p>
