                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes snapped up, sharp and cold. &#34;Stop trying to stir things up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out a light chuckle. &#34;Why would I? Daniela said that now that you&#39;re out of the hospital and doing better, it&#39;s time to earn a living. You can work as a server on set. Oh, and keep an eye on Natalie while you&#39;re at it. Think of it as a family reunion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s gaze dropped, but the fire in her eyes burned strong. &#34;You want to use me against Natalie, don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t forget; she&#39;s my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is, but does that matter? Your daughter threw you under the bus without a second thought. You heard her yourself, didn&#39;t you?&#34; Lillian shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse clenched her jaw. &#34;A mother&#39;s instinct is to protect her child.&#34; Lillian gave a knowing nod. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s see how long you stick to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and strolled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the study, Daniela sat in the center, facing Nina across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, did you catch Natalie&#39;s expression just now? She looked miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched Nina&#39;s excitement carefully. &#34;Are you certain about getting involved? She had no problem turning on your mother. She won&#39;t hold back on you either. Think about it, Nina. If you&#39;re unsure,you can still step away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nina first stepped forward for the lead role,Daniela had been caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it all made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hadn&#39;t let go of her grudge; she&#39;d merely been waiting for the right moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, no one knows you better than family. Nina knew Natalie too well-her arrogance, her vanity, her desperation to be in the spotlight. She was bound to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Nina had secured the lead role before Natalie could even try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong with this, Daniela. I know you&#39;re looking out for me, but some things-I have to handle them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. She understood Nina&#39;s resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been humiliated, her engagement cancelled. But now, she had found her purpose again. And that purpose was revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Just think about it. This film is backed by Elite Lux and Phillips Group. If anything gets too overwhelming, tell me. You can step away anytime,and I&#39;ll handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes welled up. &#34;Thank you, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, at the grand opening ceremony of Ultimate Kung Fu, Daniela stood front and center as the investor. The male and female leads flanked her,while Natalie, the second female lead, stood awkwardly off to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd showered Nina with praise, calling her the perfect choice for the role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face darkened, her icy glare locked onto Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment when no one was watching,Natalie stepped in front of Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Nina could react, a sharp slap landed on her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wretched woman! What&#39;s with that smug face?Flaunting your role, are you? Can&#39;t wait for the world to know you&#39;re the lead? Let me tell you something.No matter who gets the lead, no one outshines me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina brushed Natalie&#39;s hand away, straightening up.Her gaze was ice-cold as she met Natalie&#39;s burning fury head-on. &#34;Oh? No one can overshadow you?Then why are you seething right now? Face it, Natalie -I&#39;m the lead, and that&#39;s not changing. The male lead? He&#39;s charming, sure, but his attention is all on me. Even if you beat me senseless, you still won&#39;t take my place. And let&#39;s not forget-this film is backed by our cousin. If you lay a hand on her lead actress, do you think she&#39;ll just let it slide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression contorted with fury. &#34;Are you threatening me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a soft chuckle. &#34;I&#39;m just stating facts.Can&#39;t handle someone else stealing the spotlight?Still think the world revolves around you? Wake up,Natalie. The times have changed. You&#39;re no longer the Dury family&#39;s prized daughter. But me? I&#39;m still Daniela&#39;s cherished cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina!&#34; The male lead waved from across the set,flashing a bright smile. &#34;The director wants to go over the script with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s lips curved into a smile. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll be right over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the furious twist of Natalie&#39;s face, Nina felt a wave of satisfaction wash over her. &#34;If there&#39;s nothing else, Natalie, I&#39;ll be going. Your scenes as the second female lead won&#39;t start for a while. Maybe head back to the hotel if you&#39;ve got nothing better to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her fists, watching Nina approaching the director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male lead pointed to Nina&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lowered her head, silent, but her eyes flickered briefly towards Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, Natalie caught sight of the male lead and director exchanging disapproving frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s entire body shook with fury!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sly, manipulative snake!</p>
