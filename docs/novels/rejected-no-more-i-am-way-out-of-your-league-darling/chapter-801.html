                <p>Alexander&#39;s heart splintered into a thousand pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined Daniela would strike him, especially with such force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He collapsed to his knees, his body shaking from the agonizing pain. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you remember our past?Didn&#39;t we have good times together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was as frigid as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lighting cast harsh shadows on her face, her expression as blank as the night, making her appear distant and unfeeling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did we?&#34; Daniela retorted, her voice cold. &#34;I don&#39;t recall. We&#39;re adults now, and I honestly can&#39;t understand why you keep emnbarrassing yourself like this. First,you deceived me by trying to take my flight,and then you followed me all the way here. Weren&#39;t you supposed to be visiting a sick relative? So, why are you here? Your relative is Nikolas, huh? Well,you&#39;re quite the fortune-teller, aren&#39;t you? You seemed to know Cedric would go after Nikolas before it even happened. But how is it that you didn&#39;t foresee yourself getting a beating?&#34; Alexander clutched his throbbing arm, his eyes vacant as they locked onto Daniela The pain, both physical and emotional, washed over him &#34;Daniela, you never used to hold things against me like this. What changed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly process the reality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been indifferent to most things. It was just a handful of fake photos. He&#39;d apologized the moment she stepped out of the car, yet she responded with unrelenting fury This wasn&#39;t the woman he remembered!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right-I don&#39;t give a damn.&#34; Daniela never let such things trouble her It might sting, but resorting to violence wasn&#39;t her way &#34;Say whatever you want. Do whatever you will. It doesn&#39;t matter I won&#39;t let these petty matters get under my skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gazed at her, his confusion palpable. &#34;Then why hit me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was cold as she responded,&#34;But you showed those photos to Cedric, didn&#39;t you? He knows the photos are nothing but a lie, yet they still wound him. If you bring him pain, I&#39;ll return it tenfold.Alexander,mark my words-this isn&#39;t finished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at her in shock. &#34;I&#39;ve got a broken arm already. Isn&#39;t that enough? What more do you expect from me? Do I need to die for Cedric to let go of his rage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face was unreadable&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was left speechless, his thoughts paralyzed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were cold and unyielding. &#34;Alexander,you&#39;ll soon learn the cost of provoking me over and over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed kneeling on the cold ground, dazed and motionless for what felt like an eternity. His eyes fixed on her retreating figure, disbelief settling in-he never imagined he and Daniela would find themselves in a moment like this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela entered the hospital, pushing open the door to Nikolas&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, caught off guard, shot up from the bed, while Hamilton immediately stood from his chair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In silence, Daniela threw the photos she had been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window stood ajar, and the gusting wind swept the photos into the room like confetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of the photos slapped against Hamilton&#39;s face,the sound echoing like a rapid series of slaps Daniela pulled out a chair, sat down, and spoke with quiet intensity. &#34;Explain this to me &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes &#34;Look at me. I&#39;ve already been beaten up by Cedric What more do you want? You and your husband are impossible to deal with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a faint, mocking smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, she raised her eyes, her gaze devoid of warmth,and in a low, icy voice, she said, &#34;Not enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had long known that Daniela was the leader of Cealmaur</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knowledge was not new to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was a world of difference between hearing of it and experiencing it firsthand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he stood several meters away, he could almost feel the lethal energy radiating from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she planning to kill someone?</p>
