                <p>Noticing how unfazed Daniela was, Damon quickly turned to Cedric. &#34;Cedric, you have to talk some sense into her. I&#39;m telling you the truth-she can&#39;t hold a candle to our father. He built McCoy Group from scratch and poured his whole soul into it. The company is everything to him, and if he thinks you&#39;re a threat, he won&#39;t hesitate to crush you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas waited a moment before adding his own words, hoping to sway Cedric. &#34;Back when you two were sick, I remember a handful of people looking hopeful, ready to succeed. But every time, they were stopped cold. Some even wound up so desperate, they took their own lives. Cedric, we&#39;re saying this because we want the best for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of worry crept into Damon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men seemed convinced that Daniela was simply too inexperienced, too delicate to withstand the kind of brutal force Hamilton could unleash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could answer, the chime of the doorbell cut through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper answered, then came back with a message for Daniela. &#34;Ms. Harper, there&#39;s a visitor at the door. I asked for his name, and he said he&#39;s with McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Daniela headed for the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon darted ahead, already anxious to confront the new arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where shestood, Daniela heard Damon&#39;s startled greeting. &#34;Joseph, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face was all business. &#34;I&#39;m here for Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Is this visit on behalf of my father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a curt nod, Joseph&#39;s eyes shifted from Damon to Daniela as she stepped forward to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked Joseph&#39;s third encounter with Daniela. On every occasion, she left him with the same impression-delicate in frame, distantin manner, and bearing a regal air that set her apart from the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she was boldly challenging Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sense of pity for this striking woman lingered in his mind for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice held little warmth as he said to Daniela, &#34;Mr. McCoy requests your presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small tilt of his head pointed toward the entryway. &#34;Come with me. The car is already outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t move, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows drew together in concern, ready to intervene, but Carol was quicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blocked Joseph&#39;s path, her voice sharp. &#34;Is that how you speak to people? Why the attitude? You&#39;re the ones who need us, yet you act so high and mighty. Who gave you that right? It&#39;s been just a month since Daniela took Hamilton&#39;s title as the world&#39;s wealthiest. Now look at you-here to plead for a meeting. You understand your place, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in Daniela&#39;s circle was the type to back down easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When challenged, none of them ever backed down from a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, Hamilton&#39;s right hand, was respected by both the McCoy family and employees from McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having a much younger woman call him out in front of everyone stung his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing Daniela with a steely glare, he asked, &#34;Is this the hospitality you show your visitors? Don&#39;t forget-Oiscoll is the McCoy family&#39;s territory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of temper threatened to break through his calm facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas quickly intervened, gently pulling Carol behind him. &#34;Joseph, don&#39;t let her words get to you. She&#39;s young;cut her some slack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dismissive snort escaped Joseph, arrogance returning to his features. &#34;Time to go. Mr. McCoy isn&#39;t a man who likes to be kept waiting.&#34; As he spoke, Joseph&#39;s gaze drifted-first to Daniela, then to Nikolas&#39; hand still curled around Carol&#39;s wrist,lingering before he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;Will you be driving yourselves, or riding with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows knitted together, and he retorted, &#34;What makes you think we need your ride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph looked Cedric up and down, a flicker of reluctant respect showing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that Cedric had propelled Daniela&#39;s company back to the top in only a month proved his talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph knew true ability deserved both recognition and a touch of caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He practically wore his eagerness to please like a badge of honor, clearly satisfied with his own performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Cedric regarded him with nothing but a frosty stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout it all, Daniela never let her composure slip. &#34;If there&#39;s something to discuss, Hamilton can come here himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lingering heaviness in her body had left Daniela with little desire to venture out these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying home and keeping things quiet suited her just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Joseph bristle. &#34;So you&#39;re refusing to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela met his bluster with a dry smile and matched his arrogance. &#34;That&#39;s right.You heard me. I don&#39;t feel like leaving my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer seemed to knock Joseph off balance. &#34;No one refuses Mr. McCoy! Absolutely no one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lashes fluttered in mock surprise. &#34;Is that so? Because I&#39;m pretty sure I just did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph looked ready to explode. &#34;All right, have it your way! You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention snapped to Cedric, and his tone shifted to something almost deferential. &#34;Mr. Phillips, your recent successes have greatly impressed your father. He wants you back with the McCoys. Consider this carefully. You&#39;re not foolish enough to side with a woman who can&#39;t be predicted over a group with true power behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those parting words, Joseph spun around, pausing at the door only long enough to add, &#34;Ms. Harper, I hope you don&#39;t regret this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every syllable landed with hard finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s temper flared and she retorted, &#34;You talk big for someone on shaky ground! Regret? We&#39;ll see who&#39;s left regretting this when all is said and done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Nikolas and Damon rushed to catch up with Joseph before things got worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioning themselves on either side of him, they tried to smooth things over. &#34;Joseph, don&#39;t let this get to you. They&#39;re newcomers here in Oiscoll-they just don&#39;t understand how things work yet. How.about we both head back with you and keep the peace? There&#39;s no need to turn this into something bigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton lounged at home, fully expecting Daniela to come bowing at his doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, her company had climbed to the very top of the global rankings, but how solid was that success,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela had only reached such heights with Cedric&#39;s backing.</p>
