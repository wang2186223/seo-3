                <p>The moment Hamilton said that, silence swept through the boardroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, on the other hand, stayed completely unfazed. &#34;I know what&#39;s running through your minds right now. You&#39;re hoping to pin this on some outsider and let them take the fall, aren&#39;t you? But let&#39;s get real.Daniela didn&#39;t get where she is by being naive. Do you really believe you can fool her that easily? Someone has to answer for her mother&#39;s death. So, who&#39;s volunteering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s blunt challenge left everyone at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, one of the shareholders hesitated before turning to Hamilton.&#34;Why not just tell Daniela it was your decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton raised his head in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shareholder continued, &#34;Cedric is your son, isn&#39;t he? That makes Daniela your daughter-in-law. We made a terrible mistake all those years ago, but the truth is-Daniela just wants someone to admit what happened. If you, as her father-in-law, come clean and try to make it right, do you really think she&#39;d come after you? With her connection to Cedric, she wouldn&#39;t dare touch you. But if any of us stepped forward,she would never let it go. She&#39;s got a reputation in the mercenary world, and none of us would walk away unscathed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Hamilton. &#34;So now you&#39;ve all suddenly turned thoughtful and decided I should be the one thrown under the bus? That&#39;s your brilliant plan? I.was the only one who stood up against the idea of killing her mother. I said that business was business, but taking someone&#39;s life crossed the line. And what did you tell me? You claimed Daniela&#39;s mother had too much power, that she threatened the future of McCoy Group, and that the death of one woman wasn&#39;t something serious. When you made your move,you got me so drunk that I had to sleep at home? Now that things are falling apart, you expect me to take the fall? That&#39;s not happening!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s anger boiled over. &#34;I&#39;ve sacrificed everything I have into McCoy Group. Even my own family paid the price. I refuse to let my reputation be destroyed now!&#34; en things get tough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s stare could have frozen water. &#34;I&#39;ve already made my decision. We need to hit Daniela with an economic attack while she&#39;s still vulnerable. If we sit back and do nothing, she&#39;ll be the one coming for us the moment she regains her footing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, a heavy silence fell over the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to everyone, the secretary sitting quietly in the corner was capturing every word,logging the details of the tense board meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting finally ended, the last shareholder paused, startled to see the secretary still there.&#34;What are you still doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary adjusted his glasses, flashing a polite grin. &#34;I&#39;ve just been taking notes like always. The boss asked me to keep track of anything important and offer help if needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shareholder&#39;s expression soured. &#34;Next time, there&#39;s no need for you to stick around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod and his laptop tucked under his arm, the secretary left, still wearing that pleasant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Hamilton found Nikolas waiting for him in the office. &#34;Dad, what did you mean by what you said back there?&#34; Nikolas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;You&#39;re not part of McCoy Group anymore.&#39;These aren&#39;t your concerns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas tried to protest, but Hamilton cut him off with a cold glare.&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
