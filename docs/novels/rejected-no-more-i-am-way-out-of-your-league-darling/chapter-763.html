                <p>Damon tugged at his collar, his frustration apparent as he fidgeted with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked onto Daniela with a determined intensity, refusing to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really Shim, aren&#39;t you?&#34; he demanded, his voice firm and insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a simple nod. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of excitement flickered in Damon&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parted his lips, eager to say more, but Nikolas yanked him aside, making him stumble slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he regained his footing, Daniela had already reached the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he hurried after her..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire McCoy family watched as Damon pursued Daniela, their eyes following his every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all assumed he was simply unable to accept defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s car sped off into the distance, but Damon stood frozen, staring after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone approached him, offering some consolation. &#34;Damon, it&#39;s not the end. You lost this time, but you&#39;ll win next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were meant to soothe him. But Damon didn&#39;t brush it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression turned serious as he replied, &#34;No. With my skills, I&#39;ll never be able to beat Shim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person stared at him in disbelief.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon opened his mouth to explain further, but Nikolas yanked him away, the others quickly crowding around him. Nikolas snapped, &#34;What are you saying? You&#39;ll never win? You should&#39;ve accused Daniela of cheating!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen scratched his head in irritation. &#34;Exactly! And you even chased after her. Haven&#39;t you embarrassed yourself enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles added with a frown, &#34;I noticed Dad&#39;s face looked terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran muttered, &#34;We&#39;re definitely in for a lecture when we get home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, however, seemed lost in his thoughts, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the car had vanished,paying no mind to their chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Daniela was getting ready for her visit to McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric trailed closely behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re truly not going to let me return to the McCoy family?&#34; he inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked,&#34;Why would you return? They are a bunch of idiots.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they glanced ahead, Damon stood at the entrance of McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes and stepped protectively in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon offered a small smile, tilting his head as he addressed Daniela. &#34;Shim... Or should I call you Daniela?Or perhaps dear sister-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed in resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his gaze. &#34;Call her Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon managed a smile and asked, &#34;Would you mind signing an autograph for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every employee of McCoy Group turned their attention to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most assumed Damon had come to confront Daniela, perhaps to settle old scores. But when he pulled out an autograph book and approached her with an almost fan-like respect, everyone was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could respond, Nikolas stepped out from the building, his gaze icy as he remarked, &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to arrive so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot him a frosty smile, &#34;I come when I feel like it. Is that a problem? Oh wait, I forgot-McCoy Group isn&#39;t yours yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you!&#34; Nikolas snarled, his anger making veins pulse on his forehead. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t get too cocky! It was just a petty game yesterday. Do you really think you&#39;re so impressive? This is a global corporation, not a playground. You might want to stop before you make a fool of yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a light laugh. &#34;Is that right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you think I&#39;m powerlessand blind to everything, why are you so terrified of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; fury flared instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked, lifting her chin with defiance. &#34;Step aside. Don&#39;t stand in my way.&#34;</p>
