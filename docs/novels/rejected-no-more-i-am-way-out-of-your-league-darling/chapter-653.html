                <p>As Daniela stepped out of the villa, she spotted Cedric standing near the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod and got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat in the back while Carol and the driver took the front seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to move back into the villa with you.&#34;Worried she might say no, Cedric quickly added,&#34;I used to live there with you. Back then, we weren&#39;t even married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela already knew that was what he&#39;d come to discuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t say anything, Cedric kept going. &#34;I promise I won&#39;t get in your way. I&#39;ll stay in the guest room downstairs. Just like before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was steady. &#34;That won&#39;t work this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to her fast. &#34;Why not? You agreed before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked out the window. &#34;And now, I don&#39;t.&#34; Cedric stared at her, eyes filling with pain. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Daniela answered, &#34;BecauseI need to handle this myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time she let Cedric come home with her, the explosion happened. She lost her baby; four people were seriously hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was dealing with memory loss, and the person behind the explosion was still out there,waiting for the right moment to strike again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be more cautious. She didn&#39;t have too much time to worry about Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle myself,&#34; Cedric said, his eyes full of quiet resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attack had happened when she was pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever planned it had studied her past. They struck when she was at her weakest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Cedric walk into that kind of danger again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you won&#39;t let me inside, I&#39;ll pitch a tent out front,&#34;Cedric said. &#34;I&#39;m not leaving you to deal with this on  your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosion had left scars on him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t shown up in time, she wouldn&#39;t have survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lost three years. He didn&#39;t want to waste another second apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was headstrong. So was Cedric. Neither one would budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when she got to Elite Lux, she still hadn&#39;t changed her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat at his own desk at Elite Lux, looking both pitiful and inexplicably determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked at Daniela. &#34;What do we do about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave him,&#34; said Daniela, her voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Daniela got out first. Cedric followed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up to the villa. Daniela stepped out,and Cedric grabbed his tent. He set it up right at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to Daniela.&#34;He′Sstill a CEO. Isn&#39;t it a little much to let him camp out by the road?&#34; Daniela narrowed her eyes. Without a word, she walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and Jack was already there,holding out a glass of water to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood off to the side,fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had raised him herself, but he&#39;d never treated her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, when she thought about the inheritance he might get from Daniela one day, she felt slightly better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack&#39;s so good to you, Daniela,&#34; Joyce said, her tone bitter. &#34;Better than he is to me, and I&#39;m his mother.You hardly give him anything. Do you really deserve that kind of devotion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden joined in. &#34;He&#39;s your nephew. You should help him get into the best school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t speaking out of kindness. He had a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step by step, he wanted to ease Daniela into doing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First came the school fees. Then came the tutoring After that, he&#39;d ask her to pay for everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she said yes now, the rest would be easy. But Daniela caught on before they could even finish She smiled slightly. &#34;I&#39;m not responsible for raising your kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face tightened. She was ready to explode,&#34;You&#39;ve got money. What&#39;s the harm in helping a child?No wonder you can&#39;t have one of your own. You&#39;re too selfish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the slap-sharp and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze.&#34;You hit me?&#34; she gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage boiled up in her, and she stepped forward,ready to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela reached into her pocket,pulled out a knife,and tossed it onto the table. It landed with a loud clack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden flinched. &#34;Let&#39;s just talk, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she returned, Daniela had changed. Every time he saw her, he felt something cold and dangerous hovering around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to steady his voice. &#34;Let&#39;s sit down and have a proper conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, Tasha peeked out. She saw Joyce and Caiden shrink into themselves. Daniela was impatient. &#34;Blood doesn&#39;t buy you protection. The only reason I&#39;m talking to you is because I need answers. Give me what I want, and you can stay. But if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll throw you out on the spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes didn&#39;t blink. They burned with a quiet threat.&#34;You hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s voice rang out from the living room. He was still on the floor, playing. &#34;It&#39;s raining!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to the window. The drizzle had started falling in thin, steady lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together.</p>
