                <p>Daniela said nothing. Not a single word left her lips as she turned and walked straight out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after she watched her get into the car did Carol exhale and follow behind, lips pressed tightly together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you seriously going to support someone from the McCoy family in the inheritance battle?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes fixed on the window, Daniela replied flatly,&#34;γes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the only way to peel back the lies and unearth the person behind her mother&#39;s death. Losing her first child had carved a wound that never stopped bleeding, and letting that go wasn&#39;t an option. She needed to avenge both her mother and her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol couldn&#39;t wrap her head around it. &#34;Then why not Cedric? He&#39;s a McCoy too, and he&#39;s the eldest son.On top of that, if Hamilton&#39;s been carrying guilt for neglecting his duties toward Cedric all these years,wouldn&#39;t that make it even more likely for Cedric to get something out of this? You&#39;re married to him, after all.Fighting for the inheritance side by side would make a lot more sense than throwing your support behind someone else in the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That much, to her, felt obvious. In her eyes, no one loved deeper than Cedric did. She&#39;d never witnessed a husband more devoted than him. To her, Daniela&#39;s decision felt needlessly complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned her head, hoping for something-anything-that might explain it. But Daniela just kept staring out into the night, the moonlight brushing half her face, making her look distant. Almost unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled on in silence. Minutes passed, and Carol started to believe she wouldn&#39;t get an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a whisper-barely audible. &#34;The McCoy family is dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words hung in the air, the car rolled to a stop in front of the villa. Carol sat frozen, her eyes trailing Daniela as she stepped out. She had believed Daniela was driven purely by revenge, willing to sacrifice everything else as long as Cedric stayed out of harm&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What caught her off guard was discovering that Daniela actually cared about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carol pulled open the car door, she murmured to herself, &#34;Didn&#39;t she lost her memories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always kept her distance, never one to get entangled in emotional nuances. For the longest time, Carol assumed Cedric meant nothing to her now. Clearly, she&#39;d misread the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the hospital room, a heavy silence lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each man kept to his own corner,caught in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let his eyes drift toward the two figures resting nearby. &#34;What&#39;s going through your heads?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles blinked, startled. &#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen feigned ignorance.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration seeped into Nikolas&#39; tone. &#34;Daniela said she plans to support one of us. With the others gone,it&#39;s just the three of us here. What are your thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire flashed briefly in Charles&#39; gaze, but his voice remained guarded. &#34;Hard to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen kept silent, tugging the blanket higher like it might shield him from the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes, Nikolas turned his attention to Kohen. &#34;Your turn,&#34; he said, letting his irritation show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen pulled the blanket closer again, wrapping it tighter around himself. &#34;I think...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Nikolas had already caught on, the unspoken words clear in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kohen could continue, Nikolas interjected, &#34;This is a McCoy matter. It should stay that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words made Kohen shift uncomfortably, a glint of annoyance flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Nikolas was the oldest among the five brothers. If seniority meant anything, he was the natural successor. The family elders had leaned toward him from the beginning. Why else would the news of Cedric&#39;s return rattle him so deeply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hle had once stood as the strongest contender to inherit the family legacy, carrying more promise than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,even without Cedric, Daniela&#39;s support was crucial in deciding the heir of the McCoy family since she was the second wealthiest person in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By declaring that this was a McCoy matter, Nikolas made his position crystal clear. He wasn&#39;t just protecting tradition. He was staking his claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without question, Nikolas had his sights set on the McCoy inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare hardened as it moved between Charles and Kohen. &#34;Let me remind you-Cedric is Daniela&#39;s husband. Why would she cast him aside to support one of us? Think about it. There&#39;s something deeper going on. The two of you always seem to have a sharp answer for everything. Can&#39;t you see it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave a sharp nod. &#34;Right. I nearly walked right into her trap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backing him immediately, Kohen added, &#34;Exactly! She&#39;s no fool. Why would she offer us support out of nowhere? She&#39;s just paving the way for Cedric to rise. We can&#39;t let her use us like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening closely, Nikolas watched their faces. Slowly, his stern expression loosened, the edge of suspicion fading. &#34;Then we&#39;reagreed. No one makes a move on their own. No private dealings with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Charles and Kohen nodded in unison. &#34;Of course not. We&#39;re family. And family decisions stay in the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time night settled over the city, the hospital had gone still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen lay in silence, his eyes drifting toward the glowing moon outside the window. After a while, he whispered,&#34;Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only silence greeted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments passed, and with no reply, he tried again, voice even softer.&#34;Charles?&#34; Still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly five minutes later, the soft rustle of a blanket broke the silence. A quiet figure slipped out of bed,slipped on his shoes, and eased the door open before vanishing into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut with a soft click, and Nikolas gradually let his eyes drift open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, a glimmer of icy, deliberate malice sparked in his gaze.</p>
