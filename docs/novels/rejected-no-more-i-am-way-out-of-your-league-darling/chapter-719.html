                <p>Carol nodded, then executed a few swift, graceful drifts, easily shaking off the car tailing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow had never imagined he&#39;d see Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never expected Daniela&#39;s reach to be so extensive. He had already escaped to a remote location in Zentara,relying solely on cash to stay off the radar, yet she stil managed to track him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who exactly are you?&#34; Winslow demanded, glaring coldly at Daniela. &#34;How did you manage to find me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in black, Daniela seemed to merge with the night, and her gaze was icy. &#34;How I found you doesn&#39;t concern you. You need to answer what I want to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be joking!&#34; Winslow snapped.&#34;Why would I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the cold night sky, Daniela slowly let a smile spread across her face. &#34;Winslow, do I need to remind you where you hid your assets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s heart clenched instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you lose that money, will your young daughter end up sinking into the same misery I once did?&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s face flushed with agitation.&#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a slight smirk. &#34;What exactly wouldn&#39;t I dare to do? If I found you, tracking your daughter would be even easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s fists curled tight. &#34;What do you wish to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was like ice. &#34;Everything! I want the full story. How did my mother die? Who gave the order?How did you escape prison, and who helped you? I want every last detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow gritted his teeth, eyes narrowing. &#34;If I talk, can you guarantee my daughter&#39;s safety?&#34; Winslow suddenly fell silent. She was right. He had no other option but to trust Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one broke me out of prison. I escaped on my own after finding out someone was trying to kill me.1didn&#39;t recognize the person who came after me.&#34; Winslow&#39;s voice quivered. &#34;Your mother was killed by someone called M. He saw her power growing and felt threatened. I think he believed she&#39;d overshadow him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her gaze, her tone turning cold. &#34;Whois M?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know exactly, but I&#39;m certain it&#39;s someone from the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knitted. &#34;What makes you so sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because at that time, your mother held immense power. After becoming the richest person in the country,her status soared within just a few months, and she even rose to become the world&#39;s wealthiest. It&#39;sonly natural that the McCoy family felt threatened. Moreover, during a phone call, I overheard someone call out to Mr.McCoy.But the McCoy family is large, and I don&#39;t know exactly who it was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol signaled one of the men to take Winslow away. Outside, Mose was already waiting. He said respectfully, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warehouse door hung ajar. Mose peeked inside and froze, completely stunned by what he saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he leaned in for another look, a sudden gust of wind slammed the warehouse door shutwith a loud bang.Mose jolted in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his men rushed over and asked, &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose tossed Winslow into the car and leaned in to whisper,&#34;I think I just saw the boss&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol drove back with Daniela, stealing countless glances at Daniela throughout the ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat silently, staring out the window, her face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol couldn&#39;t hold back any longer. Halfway through the drive, she exclaimed, &#34;Damn! This story is a brutal Carol couldn&#39;t help but feel it was too much drama. &#34;What are we going to do?&#34;</p>
