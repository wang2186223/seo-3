                <p>Katrina cast a sidelong glance at Caiden&#39;s detached expression, her eyes drifting to his phone screen,where a photo of Daniela was prominently displayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed quiet for a moment, the faintest flicker of calculation flashing in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their last heated exchange, Caiden had become a different man-aloof and disengaged,barely sparing a word for her or Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even their moments of intimacy had lost their warmth;he would pull away almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that he had some hidden agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His once palpable excitement for Joyce&#39;s pregnancy had faded,replaced with a cold indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he be shifting his reliance to Daniela instead？  That simply wouldn&#39;t do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had spent decades scheming for the Harper family fortune. There was no way she would let Daniela swoop in and claim the prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed Caiden to view Daniela as untrustworthy and realize that she and Joyce were the ones he could truly depend on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s lips curved into a measured smile as she ladled soup into Joyce&#39;s bowl and settled beside her.&#34;Joyce, have you given any thought to the baby&#39;s last name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Joyce replied, &#34;Of course,it&#39;ll be Bennett. This child will be with me when l marry. It&#39;s my first, and you can see how much Alexander already cares about it. He&#39;ll adore this baby just as much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had been Katrina&#39;s plan all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce would marry into the Bennett family, taking the Harper family&#39;s assets with her. Over time, those assets would pass to her child. However, as the Bennett family&#39;s influence waned,Katrina began rethinking the inheritance and the child&#39;s role in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The child should carry the Harper name instead,&#34;she proposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce and Caiden both turned to Katrina, startled by her suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile softened as her eyes settled on Joyce. &#34;Joyce, you&#39;re not Caiden&#39;s biological daughter. It was me who brought you into this family.But all these years, he&#39;s done nothing but treat you with kindness. Raising a child is no small task, and you owe him your gratitude. Without his support, you wouldn&#39;t have the comfortable life you enjoy today.Do you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce blinked, confused by the sudden change in Katrina&#39;s stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I first joined the Harper family, I made a promise to Daniela, in front of the media, that l wouldn&#39;t have any more children to avoid upsetting her. But over time, Caiden has regretted that  decision, and Peyton has voiced his displeasure,saying our branch of the family has lost its importance. Caiden has always cared for you, Joyce.So, I propose that this child takes the Harper name.It would become a part of the Harper legacy,strengthening the family, and also show gratitude to Caiden for all he&#39;s done for you. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was left speechless, her mind racing. When she glanced at Caiden, his eyes sparkled wit hope and happiness. After a moment of thought, she finally nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;  recent days. &#34;Mom, does the baby really need to take the Harper name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina scoffed lightly, &#34;Silly girl, what does a last name really mean? If changing it can guarantee a life of wealth and privilege for both you and your child,does the name really matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a cold laugh. &#34;Caiden is selfish and manipulative. If we don&#39;t play our cards carefully, do you think he&#39;ll willingly hand over the family fortune to you and the baby? Now that you&#39;ve agreed to let the child take the Harper name, he&#39;s thrilled. Daniela won&#39;t even cross his mind anymore. People like Caiden only care about securing their future, not the welfare of others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina spoke, a gleam of malice flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, no matter what last name the child carries,they&#39;ll always be yours. Blood ties can never be broken, and you must hold on to that truth for the rest of your life. Caiden doesn&#39;t grasp this, which is why he turned his back on Daniela. Listen-whether  the child is a boy or a girl, the most important thing is that they respect and follow your lead. Names,loyalty, and affection from others are mere distractions. When you grow old, do you think your child will reject you because of a last name? A wealthy child ensures a secure future for you.Look at my mother. She&#39;s reaping the benefits of having a daughter like me. Who wouldn&#39;t envy her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded, only partly grasping the full weight of the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to make sure the baby lived a life of wealth and privilege. She would go to any lengths necessary to ensure their future was secure.</p>
