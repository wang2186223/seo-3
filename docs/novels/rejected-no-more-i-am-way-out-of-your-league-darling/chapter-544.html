                <p>Lillian knocked on the door. &#34;Daniela, the car is ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Daniela was joined by Ryan, Lillian, and Nina on her outing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the wheel was Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they arrived, Hackett&#39;s eyes first landed on Cedric behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face beamed with smiles,but when Cedric opened the door and Daniela stepped out, his grin faltered ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t bring my wife along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett quickly masked his discomfort with a strained smile. &#34;Of course,you can!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they followed Hackett inside, Daniela was struck by how the unassuming exterior of the house gave way to a world of hidden opulence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, a vast sea of blooming flowers greeted them,followed by an endless stretch of manicured golf greens, and yet another garden before they reached</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no surprise that Hackett had suggested driving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took in her surroundings with interest,her smile widening. &#34;Mr. Graves, it seems you employ over fifty servants, mostly women except for the security. Your public support for women seems more than just words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a hearty laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group followed him through the doors, greeted by an interior so opulent it could have been lifted from a classic painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes were drawn to priceless antiques,while the luxurious surroundings were complemented by the soothing sound of flowing water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Nina, a seasoned traveler, couldn&#39;t hide her amazement. &#34;This isn&#39;t a home; it&#39;s like living in a palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delighted by the praise, Hackett clapped his hands,and in an instant, the maids appeared to serve the dishes.Each plate was a masterpiece of culinary art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett clapped once more, and three young women descended the stairs, their anklets chiming softly with each step, lending an enchanting charm to the villa. &#34;Allow me to introduce my three daughters,&#34; Hackett said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was already captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them was the epitome of purity and grace,her large eyes seeming to hold a gentle, flowing stream within them. Her smile was so captivating that even Nina, a woman herself, felt her heart flutter with admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed the three girls. Hackett had truly spared no expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Hackett concocted a reason to take Cedric to meet an important shareholder, guiding him to his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the study, Hackett poured coffee for Cedric with a cheerful demeanor. &#34;Mr. Phillips, I hope the meal was to your liking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett offered a faint smile as the study door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His three daughters stepped in and greeted Cedric.&#34;Hello,Mr.Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett flashed a smile before stepping out of the room. Cedric rose from his seat as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett quickly flashed a smile and said, &#34;Mr.Phillips,please make yourself comfortable. I&#39;ll return shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evident that Hackett intended to leave Cedric alone with his daughters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Cedric had encountered many unsavory situations, this one still left a bad taste in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Cedric&#39;s frosty demeanor, Hackett quickly added, &#34;Mr. Phillips, did my words yesterday hold no weight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett waved dismissively, signaling for his daughters to leave the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, my three daughters are quite stunning.Are you interested in any of them? I&#39;d like to propose a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was at this moment that Hackett&#39;s true intentions became clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Daniela is just a figurehead. You&#39;re the one pulling the strings in the business world. I hope you&#39;ll cease your efforts and give us some space.&#34; Hackett smiled faintly. &#34;As part of the deal, my three daughters will be at your disposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes. &#34;All three?&#34; Hackett nodded. &#34;It&#39;s their fortune to be with someone like you. Rest assured, they&#39;ve been raised to be ideal companions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Daniela was savoring the fruit,while Cedric descended with a sour expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela beamed, offering the fruit in her hand. &#34;It&#39;s a new variety. Very delicious. You should try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cast a helpless glance at Daniela, who seemed unfazed by everything, before pulling her up and saying,&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett bid them farewell. &#34;Mr. Phillips, if you decide,have your secretary reach out to me. I&#39;ll be waiting for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way back, Daniela continued to enjoy the fruit she had just sampled at the villa. The tomatoes were small, fresh, and juicy,bursting with sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian and Nina each picked one, their eyes lighting up with delight after tasting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed deeply. &#34;You three only care about the food. Daniela, if you keep eating like this, someone might steal your husband away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,oblivious to him, continued discussing the new tomato variety with Lillian and Nina. Cedric closed his eyes in frustration, and after stepping out of the car, he called his secretary to look into the fruit, casting a resentful glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela was gently laid back on the bed, her senses were filled with the sweet aroma of the fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s mind began to blur, and he found himself muttering,&#34;This fruit really is delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, exhausted, nestled in Cedric&#39;s arms and let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; Cedric asked, trying to sound authoritative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, kissed Cedric on the lips. &#34;Whyare you upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t care about me!&#34; Cedric accused, his voice tinged with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I not care about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened as he pulled her close,holding her tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Didn&#39;t you notice? Those three girls don&#39;t resemble Hackett at all. Not only that, but they don&#39;t even look like sisters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s grip loosened, and he slowly lowered his head,  considering her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed up at Cedric, her smile full of mischief.</p>
