            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A sharp crash rang out, shattering the silence,followed by a haunting stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly lifted her gaze, her expression icy,before casually pulling a wet wipe from her bag and cleaning her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The simple gesture jolted Katrina back to reality.A piercing scream tore from her throat, echoing through every corner of the room. Pain shot through her injured finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned in, and her lips curled into a sinister smile as she asked, &#34;Doesn&#39;t it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gasped, her body trembling in fear. She saw Daniela&#39;s smile, but it was as if Brylee was standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Katrina&#39;s gaze with calm detachment,offering a smile that seemed almost innocent. &#34;You pushed your way into the Harper family right after my mother passed.Do you remember how that made me feel? Did you think I was too scared to speak up, or that Caiden mattered so much to me that I wouldn&#39;t dare upset him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling her broken finger, Katrina&#39;s fear deepened with every step Daniela took closer. She mumbled incoherently, her body shrinking back in terror. To her,Daniela appeared utterly unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, I normally couldn&#39;t care less about you. But since you all insist on harassing me, let me make one thing clear-I won&#39;t hesitate to fight back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was soft, yet filled with an unmistakable steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calmness on her face made a chill run down Katrina&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Daniela seemed to resemble Brylee more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was beautiful, merciless, and uninterested in speaking a word more when a single action would suffice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear crept slowly into Katrina&#39;s heart, tightening its grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Katrina cornered,Alexander quickly moved to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he took a step forward, someone stepped in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric crossed his arms nonchalantly. &#34;That&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you see what Daniela&#39;s doing?&#34; Alexander asked,his voice rising, &#34;She&#39;s hurting Katrina. Aren&#39;t you concerned she might call the police? Are you just going to stand by and watch this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s laugh was low and unhurried. &#34;Relax, buddy.I&#39;ve got top-notch lawyers and endless financial support. Unless someone dies, this isn&#39;t a big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared, stunned by Cedric&#39;s obvious favoritism. &#34;You&#39;re just letting her do this?&#34; he asked,unable to hide his disbelief. ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grinned again. &#34;I&#39;m courting her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s shock quickly morphed into something darker. He locked eyes with Cedric, emphasizing each word. &#34;Daniela was married before. She was married to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled. &#34;Oh my God,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had known Cedric&#39;s interest in Daniela was more than just business. But Cedric was one of the most powerfuI men in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric wanted to have a fling with Daniela, Alexander could understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hearing Cedric claim he was actively pursuing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That felt completely surreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought Cedric had lost his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Joyce was frantic, screaming about calling the police. Daniela,however, didn&#39;t seem bothered at all. She simply shrugged, settling into a chair as if she had all the time in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina teetered on the edge of unconsciousness,overwhelmed by pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,her voice trembling with worry, rushed to her side. &#34;Mom, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was busy playing a shooting game on her phone, the loud blasts from the game echoing through the room. She appeared completely unfazed by Katrina&#39;s suffering or Caiden&#39;s critical state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood, fury flashing in her eyes as she glared at Daniela. &#34;You&#39;re just here to make our lives hell, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t flinch. She gave a simple nod. &#34;Yes.Isn&#39;t that clear? I&#39;d say you&#39;re not exactly known for your intellect if you have to ask.&#34; Joyce seethed at Daniela&#39;s cold attitude. &#34;How did you turn into this, Daniela? Just because you have money doesn&#39;t give you the right to do whatever you please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a dry laugh, her fingers still tapping at her game. &#34;Maybe you should work your way up to mny level before you start lecturing me about what&#39;s possible or not. But I doubt that&#39;ll ever happen. With your lack of initiative, you&#39;ll never know what it&#39;s like to actually hold power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head, pretending to sympathize.&#34;Even if you did marry Alexander, I highly doubt you&#39;d ever really control his family&#39;s fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s anger flared. But, unfortunately, Daniela&#39;s words hit home. She had never been quick on her feet. The only time she&#39;d ever gotten the upper hand over Daniela was when Alexander left Daniela for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that it was obvious Daniela had no interest in Alexander anymore, Joyce had no way to claim another victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fury made her voice shake, but it was clear she couldn&#39;t land a hit on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t even get close to Daniela,with Cedric standing guard near her, relaxed yet protective, like a warning to anyone who thought to approach Joyce balled her fists, her voice rising in a sharp,high -pitched tone. &#34;Just wait! The police are on their way!&#34;she yelled, her finger stabbing the air, aimed at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of the police, Daniela paused her game. She raised her eyes slowly, her calm gaze settling on the finger Joyce had pointed at her.</p>
