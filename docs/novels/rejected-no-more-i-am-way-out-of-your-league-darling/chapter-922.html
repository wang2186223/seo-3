                <p>Josh&#39;s comments made his siblings frowNn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had indeed said those words before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had their own ambitions, and now that Hamilton had stepped down, everyone secretly wished for their own children to take the reins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, no one had anticipated things would spiral out of control like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mason&#39;s still lying in the hospital, and you&#39;re already competing for McCoy Group? Have you all lost your sense of shame?&#34; Josh&#39;s voice rang out, sharp and indignant. &#34;Weren&#39;t you the same ones who said Daniela was too dangerous, that if she survived,she&#39;d become a problem? Or have you all conveniently forgotten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy silence settled over the group. Jules hesitated, then spoke. &#34;Josh, we&#39;re not blaming you, but things are getting desperate. Maybe it&#39;s time to ask Hamilton to return, at least until we stabilize the company. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a cold, sarcastic laugh. &#34;That old fox claimed he was too sick to lead. You really think he&#39;ll just come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad quickly answered, &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t he? If we go and ask him, he won&#39;t dare turn us down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh eyed them warily. &#34;And if he does return, are you willing to put him back in charge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell as the brothers weighed the risks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, always quick to smooth things over, said,&#34;Look, now&#39;s not the time to fight over titles. Let&#39;s pull the company back from the brink and handle Daniela first, We&#39;ll figure out the rest later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to settle the worst of the tension. Still doubtful, Josh asked, &#34;You really think Hamilton</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would agree to this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad nodded, confidence in his voice. &#34;Hamilton spent years keeping McCoy Group afloat. Watching it collapse can&#39;t be easy. Give him an excuse to retarn,and he&#39;ll take it. Why wouldn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added, &#34;He&#39;s part of the McCoy family,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added his voice. &#34;That&#39;s right! Our father left Hamilton in charge for a reason. If he turns his back on us now, he&#39;s turning his back on everything our family stands for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, they found a rare moment of unity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh was quick to seize the mood. &#34;Exactly, let&#39;s not argue about who&#39;s in charge. We&#39;re family, and right now, saving the company comes first. Let&#39;s just get Hamilton to fix the stock situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others agreed with a chorus of nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, they all piled into the car, headed straight for Hamilton&#39;s estate. Inside, Hamilton was on the phone, deep in conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Joseph stood as he blocked the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s temper flared, his voice thunderous. &#34;Who do you think you are, getting in my way? Move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stood his ground. &#34;My apologies, but Mr.McCoy is in the middle of a crucial call. I can&#39;t let anyone through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad slapped him, frustration boiling over. &#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve! This is our brother&#39;s house. We come and go as we please. Don&#39;t think you can stop us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph clenched his jaw, refusing to budge.&#34;As I said, Mr. McCoy cannot be disturbed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second slap landed, rougher this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood trickled from the edge of Joseph&#39;s mouth, but he didn&#39;t step aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules snapped, &#34;I told you-move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Joseph held his ground, and the security team hesitated, torn. These men were all members of the McCoy family, after all. Years of serving the family had left the staff wary of taking sides in such bitter power struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph refused to budge. &#34;I&#39;ve told you already. Mr.McCoy is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Ethan&#39;s fist landed hard,knocking him off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of training made Ethan&#39;s blows brutal, and Joseph collapsed onto the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could rise, a shoe pressed down on his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp cry of pain echoed down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the house, Hamilton was still on a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end was giving him an update on McCoy Group&#39;s latest troubles. Hamilton heard the scream outside and was about to hang up when the caller said, &#34;Mr. McCoy, there&#39;s one more thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not sure if I should mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton urged, &#34;Spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Daniela...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But whatever news there was about Daniela,Hamilton never heard it. The door flew open as Josh stormed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze narrowed in annoyance as he set the phone down, missing the rest of the intelligence officer&#39;s report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s been unusually tired these days. We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just exhaustion or pregnancy. Judging by the recent changes in her eating habits, the latter seems more likely.&#34;</p>
