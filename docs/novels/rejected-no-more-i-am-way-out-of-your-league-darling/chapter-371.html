                <p>That night, Cedric ended up sleeping in Daniela&#39;s lounge at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Nina walked in and was taken aback when she saw him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in surprise, but as soon as she remembered how bluntly he had rejected her the night before, she paused, quietly collecting herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Mr. Phillips,&#34; Nina greeted,her voice steady and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew well that men often valued what was hard to get, not what was always there for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she kept her cool, maintaining a slight aloofness.She even tried to mirror Daniela&#39;s usual smile,offering a soft grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric greeted back and left Daniela&#39;s lounge without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina watched his retreating figure with a smirk,then quickly looked down at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,it seems like Daniela and Cedric had a fight!!!&#34; Nina texted, making sure to add three exclamation marks for emphasis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the excitement bubbling up. This was her chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the two of them had fought, that meant there was some kind of crack in their perfect relationship.something that couldn&#39;t easily be fixed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,all she needed to do was get Cedric drunk. With her slight resemblance to Daniela, she was sure it would be enough to win him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s chest swelled with pride as she imagined her plan coming to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby,Elyse frowned slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t buy Nina&#39;s theory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, what kind of man, after arguing with his woman, would sulk and sleep in an office lounge? It didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric truly didn&#39;t care for Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t have stayed behind like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elyse said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was used to Nina making a fool of herself, so she let her continue with her little schemes. When Natalie returned, that would be Elyse&#39;s true support for the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded, turning to Nina. &#34;You better take this chance while you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes brightened as she eagerly nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Daniela didn&#39;t come back to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was dead, and according to Caiden, she didn&#39;t deserve much of a send-off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cold and detached, as if he&#39;d never spent years of marriage with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, that&#39;s how I feel. She&#39;s gone, and no amount of mourning will change that. So why make a fuss? Isn&#39;t it embarrassing enough?&#34; he said, his voice void of any emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glared at him, her disappointment cutting deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden Harper! I&#39;ve already said I&#39;ll cover the costs.You won&#39;t pay a dime. But my mother&#39;s funeral has to be grand. She was your wife, for God&#39;s sake! Can&#39;t you at least do this for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her jaw, the memory of a hot summer day flashing in her mind. She was just a little girl, standing at the top of the stairs, watching Caiden and Katrina together, their breathing loud in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to go down, to run to her mother and ask,&#34;Mom,what are you doing? Why are you with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she stayed where she was. It was as if she understood something, but not completely. She simply stood there,silently watching for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she couldn&#39;t make sense of as a child, she now understood as an adult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always believed Caiden and Katrina had married,despite the scandal, because they loved each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, all she could see was Caiden&#39;s ugly true nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either you take Katrina away, or if she&#39;s going to be buried as my wife, it&#39;s on my terms. Don&#39;t make a spectacle of it. Just bury her quietly. I&#39;ve been humiliated enough because of her. Why should I keep suffering for her even after she&#39;s dead? She&#39;s gone,Joyce. Don&#39;t you get it? The living are what matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was stunned by Caiden&#39;s shamelessness,her eyes wide in disbelief. She couldn&#39;t believe he could be this cold. &#34;Is that all she is to you now? Just a dead body?&#34; Caiden didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;What else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s heart shattered. She nodded, then turned to Daniela. &#34;What do you think? Will you let me take my mother&#39;s body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never seen Joyce so firm before, but she couldn&#39;t help a faint smile. &#34;It&#39;s your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce narrowed her eyes at Daniela. &#34;Really? You don&#39;t see her just as a body, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce continued, &#34;I know you always believed my mother was responsible for your mother&#39;s death. But I&#39;ve asked her, and she swore she had nothing to do with it. Daniela, you&#39;ve wronged someone who had no part in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face remained stoic, her tone cold. &#34;I didn&#39;t do it, Joyce. You need to think this through. If it had been me, Katrina would have been long gone by now,a hundred times over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce scoffed in mockery. &#34;Do you expect me to buy that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression stayed cold. &#34;I don&#39;t care if you do or not. Even if I had done it, what could you possibly do about it? Some might kiss up to Doug for his wealth, but to me? He&#39;s nothing.&#34; Joyce&#39;s face drained of color at Daniela&#39;s biting words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle, her eyes glinting. ”didn&#39;t do it, but given everything that&#39;s happened,I can&#39;t say I&#39;m upset with how things turned out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before Katrina died,she whispered an apology in Daniela&#39;s ear, saying, &#34;I know I was wrong. Please, for the sake of my death, spare Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled and leaned in just as close and whispered,&#34;In your dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katrina finally passed, her eyes stayed wide open for a long time, as though unwilling to let go of something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word around town was that Katrina had died with unfinished business.</p>
