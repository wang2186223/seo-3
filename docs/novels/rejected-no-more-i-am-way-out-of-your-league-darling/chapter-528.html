                <p>The meeting was private, attended by eight individuals who had all been involved in dealing with Daniela&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arrogance was written all over their faces except for Hackett&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett shot them an angry glare. &#34;Have you forgotten how much effort it took to bring down Brylee? What happened then? Was she really defeated in the corporate world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words wiped the smug looks off their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela isn&#39;t like Brylee. Brylee built her empire within the country, meaning she had to maintain local ties and protect her reputation. That forced her to be flexible, giving us room to strategize against her. But Daniela? How many people is she connected with?Other than that stubborn Cedric, there&#39;s only the muddle-headed Richard. If I don&#39;t squeeze him, what other option do we have? And if this escalates into a full-scale price war and your business starts crumbling,don&#39;t come whining to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words left them momentarily speechless. &#34;That&#39;s not what we&#39;re saying, Hackett. We just think it&#39;s too humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should we be afraid of her? Imagine the embarrassment if people heard that the head of the association was pleading with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Hackett. You&#39;re giving Daniela too much credit. Having money isn&#39;t everything in today&#39;s world,is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett had a reputation for being both decisive and ruthless. But when it came to Brylee and her daughter,his soft approach baffled everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Hackett&#39;s stern expression, the group smirked.&#34;Alright, Hackett. We&#39;ll give Alexander a shot for you sake. But if he fails, don&#39;t expect us to hold back against Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett smirked icily. &#34;Go ahead, do whatever you want. It&#39;s not like I owe Daniela anything. When the battle begins,handle it yourselves-leave me out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Hackett was out of sight,Winslow Flores,who had been sitting beside him, smirked. &#34;We give Hackett respect most of the time, and he acts like he runs the place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey Murray scoffed. &#34;Exactly! It&#39;s just Daniela. What&#39;s so terrifying about her? This whole thing is absurd!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno Deleon slammed the table. &#34;If you ask me, we should just eliminate Daniela and make an example of her.Let the world see the power of our association!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley Astley, the youngest and usually the quietest,finally spoke. &#34;Have you considered that Daniela isn&#39;t challenging us out of arrogance? She&#39;s the richest person in the world. Taking her on might come at a steep price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from Farley, Marcus Beckett chuckled dismissively. &#34;What&#39;s there to be afraid of? Once Daniela is gone, the market is ours. Any losses we suffer now, we&#39;ll take back from her tenfold!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, the entire group erupted into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Richard managed to set up a meeting with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the cover of night, Alexander sat clad in a black suit,his face concealed behind a mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gazed into Alexander&#39;s eyes-so different from before-and felt a deep pang of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, Hackett&#39;s message is exactly as I told you.What do you think? They&#39;re not bluffing. You&#39;ve seen how the association has ruthlessly dominated the market for years, pushing countless families into  financial ruin. If you don&#39;t fall in line, they&#39;ll hit you with economic sanctions. Do you recall when our family business nearly collapsed just because I upset a minor figure in the association? It was Brylee who helped us out. Without her, we would have lost everything. This time, there&#39;s no Brylee to save us.You need to think carefully-choosing the wrong side could be catastrophic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander dropped his gaze, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his appearance had changed, he hated meeting people,as if he belonged in the shadows, unworthy of the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now,sitting before his father, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; Alexander said as he stood up, &#34;I get it. I&#39;ll think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that,Alexander made his way to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered outside until Cedric was gone, then took off his mask and stepped into the sunlight.</p>
