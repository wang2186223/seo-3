                <p>It was evening when Daniela arrived in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harper family residence was aglow, seemingly in anticipation of her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her vantage point on the plane, she noticed two figures below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could utter a word, the secretary was already in tears, &#34;Ms. Harper, welcome back! On behalf of all Phillips Group employees, we wvelcome you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was overwhelmed by such an unexpected reception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of genuine concern, Cedric asked,&#34;Are you tired?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rare joy of reunion lit up his dark eyes after such a prolonged separation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt slightly uncomfortable with the intensity of his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela was inside the house, Caiden and the others let out a collective sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did it take you so long?&#34; Caiden voiced his impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing upward, Daniela caught sight of Alexander, who was bandaged from head to toe and resting on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then looked away and headed straight upstairs to unpack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela headed upstairs without bothering to ask about his condition, which made Alexander irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on? Didn&#39;t she see him? Didn&#39;t she notice the thick bandages on him? He was disappointed by her lack of a simple greeting despite the fact that they were sharing the same space. Alexander felt both initated and bitter. He watched Cedric fotlow her upstáirs, then turned his head away.He scoffed internally, dismissing the thought of pursuing a woman like her, convinced that only a man lacking ambition would do such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a shower and, unusually, ddn&#39;t go downstairs afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted from her flight, she sprawled on the sofa, absorbed in the documents from the recently acquired Al development company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had dreamed since her childhood of building a smart home where everything responded to voice commands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The curtains would open with a blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mere glance at the food would cook it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she opened her mouth, delicious food would present itself to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By lifting a foot, the room would clean itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robots were to adjust the indoor lighting and display work on the TV screen through brainwave signals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire home would operate fully automated, needing no manual inputs and being completely intelligent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was captivated by this idea and had even bought a research lab to develop this technology, aiming to introduce it in wealthy neighborhoods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was deeply engrossed in these materials and didn&#39;t notice Lillian walking past her door, her voice floating in. &#34;Cedric, why are you loitering at Daniela&#39;s door without knocking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the door,Daniela found Cedric standing there, his head bowed. She was unsure of how long he had been waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down, Cedric presented two gift boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, puzzled, opened them. At that moment, Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce came. Katrina exclaimed, &#34;Wow! These are the items from tonight&#39;s auction, valued at two billion! So the mysterious affluent buyer was you, Cedric! Youintend to give these to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by such lavishness, Katrina felt a surge of envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two billion just for a bracelet and a brooch! Katrina&#39;s eyes turned green with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, wealthy and magnanimous, contrasted sharply with Alexander, who had once given half a million and later demanded it back. Cedric truly shone like a star.④</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder everyone regarded Cedric as the genuine article, à truly eligible bachelor! It was no overstatement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gazed at Cedric intensely, her desire evident, wishing she could be the one to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you are indeed generous.&#34; Joyce was mesmerized by the sparkling green stones, feeling her worldview expand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although they always knew Daniela and Cedric were wealthy, witnessing such opulence firsthand was an entirely different experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was clearly impressed. Who wouldn&#39;t admire such dazzling objects?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, Daniela snapped the boxes shut, shielding them from covetous eyes, and handed them back to Cedric. &#34;Keep them yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had yet to speak when Joyce&#39;s voice cut through the air. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t! If you don&#39;t want them,then 1...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out her hand, only for the boxes to be pushed back into Daniela&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, looking disheartened, confessed, &#34;I bought them just for you. If you don&#39;t want them, I might as wvell throw them away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes sparkled immediately, her gaze piercing Daniela with a silent question. &#34;Where will you throw them? I&#39;ll get them back!&#34; Daniela exhaled deeply and invited Cedric inside. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, she entered the room with Cedric close behind, the door closing to block the view of all the covetous onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Daniela turned to Cedric with a frown, took a deep breath, and questioned, &#34;What exactly are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a subdued tone, Cedric replied,&#34;I just want to make you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her hand, her expression skeptical. &#34;With these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric found himself at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had considered many options, but Daniela&#39;s wealth made it difficult to decide what to give her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the best gifts he had managed to come up with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never wooed a woman before and was completely inexperienced in such matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money was all he had to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He selected and presented only the items that were yalued highly by society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela did not seem impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking dejected, Cedric retrieved the gift boxes from Daniela&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,an unexpected idea came to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He contemplated giving Caiden three hundred million dollars, so that Caiden Would tell him how to make Daniela happy.</p>
