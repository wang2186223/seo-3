                <p>The newly crowned Best Actor, Cormac Murray,was cast as the male lead in Ultimate Kung Fu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sat idly, script in hand, but her gaze never left Cormac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features reminded her so much of Cedric that she couldn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All morning, she found herself watching him. And every time Nina acted beside him, a surge of irritation burned in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the break, Nina grabbed a cup of hot coffee and just so happened to stroll past Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sneered, &#34;Enjoy the spotlight while it lasts,Nina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Nina chuckled, blowing gently on the steam rising from her cup. &#34;However long it lasts, one thing&#39;s certain-right now, I&#39;m the one ahead of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina flashed a subtle smile and greeted Cormac just as he turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s smirk vanished in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shot her a glance and murmured, &#34;Natalie, don&#39;t you think Cormac looks a lot like Cedric?I think he might have a little thing for me. What&#39;s your take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes darkened, her glare sharp. &#34;Nina!Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smirked. &#34;Well, maybe he doesn&#39;t like me.Maybe he&#39;s just being professional since I&#39;m the lead actress. But at the end of the day, that&#39;s exactly what I am-the lead actress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes narrowed, her anger bubbling to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot to her feet, knocking into Nina&#39;s hand before delivering a sharp slap across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the slap echoed across the set, turning heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes snapped towards them in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s head was turned, her hand trembling as the scorching coffee spilled onto her skin, forming an angry red blister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina cradled her stinging cheek, shaking out her burned hand. &#34;Natalie, I get it. You&#39;re jealous that got the lead and get to work with Cormac. But I earned this role. Can&#39;t you stand seeing your sister succeed? At least let me keep some dignity in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes darted to the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet murmurs spread through the crowd as people exchanged glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if by accident, Nina turned her hand slightly,revealing the angry blister to the crowd. The swollen, translucent burn stretched across her hand,drawing gasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp rippled through the set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My God! That&#39;s her own sister, and Natalie still went that far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All over jealousy? That&#39;s completely uncalled for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes turned red, tears rolling down her cheeks, making her appear even more vulnerable.&#34;Natalie, I&#39;ve always known that I could never quite measure up to you. Since we were kids, Mom has always favored you. For years, whenever people spoke of the Dury family, your name was the only one they ever mentioned, as if I never existed. But I&#39;ve never comnplained because you&#39;re my sister. Seeing you succeed has always made me happy as well.This is just one role where I get to be the lead, and your supporting role is still significant. So why can&#39;t you bear to see your sister succeed for once?Natalie, what will it take for you to work with me, just this once?&#34; Her makeup today-soft, smudged eyeshadow and a touch of red at the corners only amplified her sorrowful appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck a chord, and the onlookers&#39; gazes softened with sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression hardened, her voice dropping to a sharp whisper. &#34;Enough, Nina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone saw Natalie&#39;s lips move, though they couldn&#39;t hear what she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The set fell into an anticipatory hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, to everyone&#39;s shock, Nina&#39;s body shuddered, and she dropped to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trembled, her voice quivering with fear. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Natalie. I won&#39;t do it again. It&#39;s my fault.I&#39;ll stay away from Cormac, I swear. Just don&#39;t hit me.Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hunched over, her body convulsing as if in terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face flushed with rage. She lifted a hand, ready to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could, a figure moved between them,blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Cormac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was calm but firm. &#34;Miss Dury, have some mercy. You should know when to back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curled into a forced smile, poised to respond, but Cormac&#39;s cold voice sliced through her attempt. &#34;Miss Dury, I appreciate your attention,but you&#39;re not my type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she about to cry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She slaps her own sister and then plays the victimn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea-there are plenty of women who play the victim these days. Did you see how hard she slapped Nina? No hesitation at all. But the moment she faces Cormac, she puts on this helpless act. lf someone walked in now, they&#39;d think she was the one who got slapped. Natalie really knows how to put on a show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! Natalie has probably been pampered her whole life, doing whatever she pleases. Someone needs to put her in her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words sank in, the entire set quietly nodded in agreement, their expressions echoing the sentiment.</p>
