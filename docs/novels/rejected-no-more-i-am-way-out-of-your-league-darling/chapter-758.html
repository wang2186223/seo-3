                <p>Nikolas rolled the dice between his fingers, lips curled in a smug grin. &#34;I&#39;ll offer you a way out,Daniela. Kneel right here, right now. Apologize in front of everyone. Do that, and maybe I&#39;ll let this slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from Damon, Daniela leaned back in her chair, her voice even and sharp. &#34;You really love hearing yourself talk, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s temper snapped. He blurted out, &#34;Fine! Act tough all you want, but once this game starts, there&#39;s no going back. When I win, don&#39;t come crawling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting, Damon signaled subtly to the referee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the cue, the referee stepped forward.&#34;Very well. Let the match-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words could leave his mouth, Charles rushed over, nearly stumbling as he stopped beside Daniela. &#34;Please reconsider. Damon&#39;s no amateur. If you lose here, the consequences will be critical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation was etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already burned bridges with the rest of the family, placing every last hope on Daniela to pull him through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela ended up losing this gamble and missed her opportunity to enter McCoy Group, his chances of becoming the heir would vanish completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles begged with genuine concern, &#34;Daniela, please don&#39;t act impulsively. There&#39;s no need to take it this far. It&#39;s just a simple game. Even if you win, it won&#39;t carry much weight. Damon is known for being unpredictable. Even if he loses, there&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;ll actually give up control of McCoy Group. But you&#39;re not like him. You were once the wealthiest person on the planet, the leader of Elite Lux. That kind of status means your word can&#39;t be taken lightly. Damon knows this, whichis why he&#39;s pushing forward without holding back. Please, hear me out. Don&#39;t take this gamble with Damon. It&#39;s better to swallow a bit of pride now than to face public humiliation later, don&#39;t you think?&#34; Charles believed he was making a convincing case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Daniela offered only a soft smile as she sidestepped him. &#34;Move. You&#39;re blocking me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched as he stepped back. &#34;Fine. But don&#39;t come crying to me when you lose. By then, it&#39;ll be too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of options, he slumped back into his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon sneered, &#34;Charles, it&#39;s a shame you&#39;re not on a leash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen interjected, &#34;Charles, honestly, what&#39;s the point? Daniela&#39;s about to lose, and you can&#39;t save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. &#34;That&#39;s right. The moment she loses, I&#39;m snapping a photo of her face. People need to see just how bad her luck really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brothers&#39; sneers grew sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the referee could lift a hand, Nikolas leaned in close to Damon and murmured, &#34;Watch her. She&#39;s cunning. If you let your guard down, she&#39;ll flip the whole thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon chuckled, unfazed. &#34;Relax, Nikolas. I&#39;ve done this a hundred times. You think I&#39;d let her beat me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a soft laugh. &#34;Good. I&#39;ll be right here waiting to celebrate your win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave him a firm nod. &#34;Then you better make it a night to remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas laughed louder. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll throw a real party. We&#39;ll invite your closest friends and let the whole family see what victory looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s grin stretched wide. &#34;Of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The referee lifted a hand and signaled the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, which had been murmuring just moments before, suddenly went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon started tossing the dice in different flashy styles, shooting Daniela a scornful glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lazily flipped her dice into the air, letting them drop without the slightest concern. Those standing behind Daniela couldn&#39;t stop the worry creeping into their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s barely trying. Look at Damon-he&#39;s thrown more times than I can count. Meanwhile, she&#39;s just sitting there like it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No kidding. Even if she&#39;s clueless, she should at least fake it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe faking it&#39;s too hard for her too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This gamble is for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join McCoy Group. She&#39;s really going to let it slip away just like that? What a shame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, why act bold if she doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s doing? I actually thought she had guts, challenging someone like Damon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give it a minute. Daniela&#39;s going to lose-hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget this. She&#39;s trying to act cool, but there&#39;s nothing worth watching here. I&#39;drather grab a drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A portion of the crowd did, in fact, drift away to grab a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in close, the secretary murmured,&#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t strike me as the reckless type.So why does she look so relaxed right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs in the second-floor gallery, Hamilton remained locked in on Daniela,eyes narrowed in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glass hovered for a second before he took a slow sip, still puzzled by her behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never been known to act without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when it came to something as serious as earning her way into McCoy Group, she wouldn&#39;t throw caution to the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet watching her let the dice roll so effortlessly, it became obvious-she wasn&#39;t a seasoned gambler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no rhythm in her throw, no control. She wasn&#39;t skilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the table, the McCoy brothers looked pleased-everyone except Charles, who kept his eyes shuttight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pumped his fist. &#34;Victory&#39;s ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen leaned forward, grinning. &#34;Honestly, it&#39;d take a miracle for us to lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran threw his arms wide. &#34;If we don&#39;t win, I swear I&#39;ll start barking!&#34;</p>
