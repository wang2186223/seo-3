                <p>Cedric glanced at Nikolas before tossing his gloves aside,his voice laced with annoyance. &#34;Don&#39;t you have something more important to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He casually grabbed a bottle of water and took a slow sip</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at Cedric&#39;s nonchalant demeanor,feeling both irritated and angry. &#34;Don&#39;t get too cocky,Cedric. I&#39;ve come to show you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t even spare him a glance. &#34;Not interested,&#34;he muttered, already turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas held out a folder. &#34;You&#39;re going to want to see this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, not wanting to waste time with someone who thrived on trouble, lifted his foot to leave. But before he could move, Nikolas had already pulled out the photos and shoved them in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cast a quick glance at the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone approached Cedric for a signature, the latter shoved the photos into his pocket, signing with a detached, blank expression. Then,he grabbed Nikolas by the tie and yanked him toward the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of triumph rushed through Nikolas. He laughed,his expression wild with glee &#34;So? Are you mad? Did you get a good look? Isn&#39;t Daniela in there? Cedric,I always thought you were this untouchable, superior guy,but turns out, you&#39;re just like the rest. Did you see?The woman you adore, now with...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his taunts, Cedric&#39;s fist was already rising in the air</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the stillness of the night, a harsh, heavy sound sliced through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fists crashed down on Nikolas-his head,face,and body-relentlessly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruised and battered, Nikolas clutched his head, blood trickling down his face, but inside, a twisted sense of satisfaction bubbled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because, in his mind, he had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had triumphed over Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had emerged victorious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas cackled, his laugh manic. &#34;So you&#39;re not a saint after all. I always thought you&#39;d be the cold,indifferent one who didn&#39;t care about a damn thing!&#34; He clutched his head, his eyes locking with Cedric&#39;s cold, unfeeling gaze. Finally, unable to withstand the weight of it, he collapsed, losing consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for the sharp-eyed security guards from McCoy Group noticing something was amiss and intervening, Nikolas might not have lived to see the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hadn&#39;t anticipated that Cedric would hit Nikolas so violently He marched toward Cedric′′Aryou out of your mind? That&#39;s your own brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric stood by the stair railing, a cigarette dangling from his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Hamilton had ever seen Cedric smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, standing a step higher than Hamilton, let his gaze drop icily, as if he were looking at a corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Hamilton&#39;s spine. &#34;What&#39;s with that cold stare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took another drag, his voice low and menacing.&#34;You should be thankful I don&#39;t hit old men. Otherwise,those punches on Nikolas wvould have been for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was stunned. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied with eerie calm, &#34;Do I need to spell it out for you? Do you thank I&#39;m an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton paused, his mind racing for a moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it Nikolas who uncovered those photos, or was it you? You know exactly what happened. Hamilton,hear me clearly-my moral compass is weak, and l don&#39;t care about blood ties Don&#39;t think for a second you can control me because of our relation. I won&#39;t be manipulated. Let me make this clear, because I&#39;ll only say it once I don&#39;t care what your plans are, but if they involve my wife or if any of those fabricated photos get out, you won&#39;t get away with it. Consider what happened to Nikolas as a warning. If this happens again, don&#39;t blame me for being harsh. You know.I can act if I want to. After all, the Lone Wolf is under my command.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric flicked his cigarette away and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hospital room, Nikolas yelled, &#34;Dad! Cedric did this to me! Aren&#39;t you going to do something about it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot Nikolas a cold,disdainful look. &#34;You did something stupid, and you blame someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Hamilton turned and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary trailed behind, speaking nervously. Mr McCoy, Daniela&#39;s flight lands in Oiscoll tonight. If she finds out we created those photos and angered Cedric,she won&#39;t let it slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton closed his eyes for a brief moment, then asked, &#34;Has Alexander arrived?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary answered, &#34;He&#39;ll be a little late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Pin it on Alexander&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s plane landed in Oiscoll</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped off the plane, a report about the incident reached her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Cedric&#39;s face, and it was really grim. Do you think he misunderstood something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Where are the photos?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric burned them himself. I only caught a glimpse of the first photo, and it showed you and Alexander together. In the photo, you and Alexander were embracing, looking extremely close. It was a crystal-clear shot, so l believe Cedric must have misinterpreted it. Oh, and I saw Cedric smoking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Daniela&#39;s eyes darkened.</p>
