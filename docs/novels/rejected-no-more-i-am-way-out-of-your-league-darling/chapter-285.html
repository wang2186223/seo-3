                <p>Joyce was on the brink of speaking when Richard stood and talkéd to Daniela. &#34;Daniela, care to join?Could be interesting gossip for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face soured further at his words. &#34;Your son already invited her. Have you all become Daniela&#39;s loyal hounds now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, unbothered by Joyce&#39;s barb, beamed at Daniela. &#34;Daniela? Why not sit next to me? You&#39;re family,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce erupted into scornful laughter. &#34;Family? What sort of family do you think you are to her? How pretentious! Daniela&#39;s the richest soul under the sun,and here you are, offering nothing but a face of desperation. Maybe take a long look in the mirror first!&#34; Alexander&#39;s face darkened at the exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Daniela putting on her headphones, Richard had no choice but to return to his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason he had shown up was the lure of the chance to speak with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to recover some of his past investments,and Daniela was his only hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his patience for Joyce&#39;s antics drained, Richard cut straight to the chase. &#34;Let&#39;s skip dinner. I&#39;ve lost my appetite. We might as well settle this now. As far as I&#39;m concerned, Joyce and Alexander are on a fast track to divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was perched across from them. She locked eyes with Alexander. &#34;What&#39;s your take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s reply was crisp and clear. &#34;We&#39;re getting a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of bitterness flitted across Joyce&#39;s face.&#34;Fine. I want half of your fortune. If that&#39;s agreeable,we can divorce tomorrow.&#34; Alexander&#39;s expression turned steely. &#34;Do you even grasp what you&#39;re demanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver. &#34;If you deny me what l want, I won&#39;t grant youa divorce. I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard couldn&#39;t contain his fury any longer. &#34;You&#39;re the one at fault here! How dare you have the audacity to make demands from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my faults, but what about Alexander? He entered this marriage while his heart belonged to another. He&#39;s well aware of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard clenched his jaw. &#34;You&#39;ve kept a boy toy, and it&#39;s the talk of the town! How can you stand there and say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why shouldn&#39;t I? If my husband fails to meet my needs, I&#39;ll find someone who does.&#34; Joyce&#39;s voice was icy, her face unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s anger was palpable, but Alexander intervened. &#34;This marriage is over, regardless. I can&#39;t split the assets in half, but to part amicably, I&#39;ll offer you six million for the six months we&#39;ve endured together. Take it or leave it. If you refuse, I&#39;m filing for divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sneered. &#34;Six million? Are you trying to discard me like I&#39;m worthless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander retorted, &#34;As far as I can tell, you&#39;re in dire need of cash. Milo isn&#39;t a reliable fallback. Without that six million, he&#39;ll leave you. I can afford to draw this out in court. Can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had done his homework on Joyce&#39;s affair with Milo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce loathed those who exploited vulnerabilities for personal gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was employing the same tactic Daniela had once used to manipulate Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice was harsh. &#34;Fifty million. NNot a penny less! Otherwise, Joyce will remain Alexander&#39;s wife indefinitely. And don&#39;t bother threatening us with court. Sure, Joyce is at fault, but Alexander&#39;s absence hasn&#39;t exactly been conducive to a healthy marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s hand trembled on the table. &#34;Joyce! Just by having you as my daughter-in-law, our family has lost millions in deals. How dare you demand fifty million!Would it kill you to let go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, all pretenses fell away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce laughed mockingly. &#34;Why should I care about dignity now? I need the money to support Milo! I&#39;ve come too far to turn back now. Give me what I want,and what happens next is none of your concern. But if you refuse, Alexander, you&#39;ll live with the shame of my indiscretions. Up till now, I&#39;ve kept silent. If talks break down, who knows what I&#39;ll say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard slammed his fist on the table. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think? Alexander has neglected me for so long. If I claim he&#39;s impotent, who would doubt it?Coupled with my affair, it would all add up.&#34; Joyce was ready to sacrifice her pride for financial gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was seething, barely able to contain his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to interject, but Joyce cut her off coldly. &#34;Mom, if you can&#39;t support me, at least dlon&#39;t hinder me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander faced Joyce, his gaze acknowledging her resolve. &#34;Alright, you&#39;re determined. I must admit,that&#39;s commendable.</p>
