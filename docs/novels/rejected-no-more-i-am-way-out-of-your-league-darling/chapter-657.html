                <p>Joyce circled Alexander, inspecting him closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her hand to her mouth, unable to stop laughing. &#34;Alexander,it really is you! What happened to your face? Did you try to turn yourself into an Avatar with plastic surgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack emerged from the car, applauding and exclaiming,&#34;An Avatar!I&#39;ve actually seen a real Avatar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce made sure to speak louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the banquet was starting, their commotion drew the attention of nearby attendees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People started pulling out their phones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the gathering crowd, Alexander heard Joyce calling out, &#34;Daniela, come here! Come see this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t the type to get caught up in the excitement. She simply cast an indifferent glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly clenched his fists, his nerves rising as he lowered his head, unwilling to let the woman he loved witness him in such a state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce was merciless. She seized the hand Alexander was using to cover his face and yanked it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face was now completely visible to everyone around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the center of everyone&#39;s attention, Alexander could hear the crowd&#39;s gasps. The embarrassment and anger made him feel extremely uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to react, but lifting his head, he caught Daniela&#39;s distant look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes filled with tears, he whispered, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was hopeful as he looked straight at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished she would come to him, to save him from the public&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regarded him as if he were just another stranger.Her eyes were cool, even somewhat cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander was about to call out to her again,Daniela looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he overheard Carol, standing next to Daniela, ask, &#34;Is that Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Daniela responded in a tone as casual as if she were talking about the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a backward glance, she proceeded into the banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt a profound sense of disappointment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she show such disregard for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be the real Daniela!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce crossed her arms and mocked, &#34;Alexander, it seems Daniela wasn&#39;t deceiving you earlier. She truly doesn&#39;t love you. She was only kind because she thought you were the boy from her past. Now, even with her memories gone,she still doesn&#39;t feel anything for you. Alexander, accept the truth. You and Daniela can&#39;t return to what you once had. She doesn&#39;t love you.She never has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter echoed at the entrance, heightening Alexander&#39;s humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander grasped his head in disbelief. &#34;This can&#39;t be!It&#39;s absolutely impossible! Daniela likes me-she loves me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela wasn&#39;t really focusing on who was at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had other matters to attend to tonight. That was why she had brought Joyce and Caiden with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, who hadn&#39;t attended such a lively event in a long time, reveled in the atmosphere, squinting with pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observers, seeing him arrive with Daniela, presumed their father-daughter relationship had improved and showed him considerable respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t worry. As soon as that person shows up,I&#39;ll know him by his scent,&#34; he promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked around and then took Jack to grab some snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat apart, coolly watching the busy banquet unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden navigated the banquet with ease and charm,occasionally examining the hands of the men there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol tilted her head and asked Daniela, &#34;Will this work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained cold as she said, &#34;Let&#39;s wait and see.&#34;</p>
