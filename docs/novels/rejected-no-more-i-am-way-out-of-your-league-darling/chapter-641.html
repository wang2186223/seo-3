                <p>Alexander&#39;s smirk widened as he saw the color drain from Cedric&#39;s face. &#34;What&#39;s the matter, Cedric? Finally coming to terms with it? You boast about your devotion to Daniela, how dearly you hold her. Yet, it&#39;s your actions that nearly killed her. You storm in here demanding answers, accusing me of spreading rumors.Maybe you should be asking whether Daniela can still bear children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes were cold slits in the low light, his stare piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander chuckled, a sound full of dark triumph. &#34;Yes,that&#39;s right. The explosion hurt Daniela badly enough to leave her infertile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words fell, another punch landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander staggered back, his face contorted in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He stumbled further back, his face now a mask of pain and mockery. &#34;Can&#39;t handle the truth?Why don&#39;t you confirm it yourself? Be brave, Cedric.Go and ask Daniela. Ask her, &#39;Can you really not have children anymore?&#39;&#34; Alexander&#39;s emotions were an intense mix at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He derived a cruel satisfaction from observing Cedric&#39;s agony, taking pleasure in his unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they not all excel in their fields?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They navigated their businesses with deft hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they stepped out of their corporate field,released from their burdens, Alexander found his peace and stood tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here they were, back again, wreaking havoc.Alexander resented their return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His envy was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Cedric losing his composure brought him joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He enjoyed witnessing their desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It thrilled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric vanished into the darkness, Alexander&#39;s face twisted into a malevolent grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the smile exacerbated his injuries, causing him to double over in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the police!&#34; shouted Richard, his voice thick with fury. &#34;Get Cedric arrested!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s hands shook as he reached for the phone.but Alexander lifted his hand in a gesture to stop him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard glared at Alexander&#39;s face, his anger evident &#34;He&#39;s trying to destroy your face. Don&#39;t you understand? He&#39;s envious of what you&#39;ve achieved; he wants to ruin you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing heavily, Alexander responded, &#34;We can&#39;t involve the police. I can&#39;t allow Daniela, or anyone for that matter, to see me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard exploded with frustration. &#34;Are we just going to let Cedric get away with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes, Alexander said, &#34;Cedric puts his heart into his love. The most devastating thing we could do is strip him of his greatest love. Dad,look after the business. I need to go abroad and get my face repaired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same night, Alexander departed for his surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing Alexander, the plastic surgeon exclaimed in horror, &#34;Oh my God! What happened to your face?It&#39;s completely damaged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant looked over and said derisively,&#34;It&#39;s like you&#39;ve been run over by a fleet of trucks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned,Alexander asked, &#34;Is it really that severe?&#34; The assistant thrust a mirror towards him aggressively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had avoided mirrors until that point.Confronted with his reflection, he recoiled in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Lord! Who is this?&#34; he exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, he shoved the mirror aside and demanded,&#34;|want my old face back. Make sure it&#39;s exactly as it was,without any changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plastic surgeon offered a comforting smile.&#34;Rest assured, we&#39;re experts in our field.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander proceeded to the examination room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant asked the doctor nervously,′′Can we really restore his face entirely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While slipping on his gloves, the doctor explained,&#34;Restoring it completely is impossible. This is real human flesh we&#39;re dealing with, not some moldable clay. Given the extent of the damage, we might manage to reconstruct about 20% of what he used to look like. Furthermore, he&#39;ll require continuous treatments monthly to maintain even that. Ever seen Avatar? Picture him looking somewhat like those blue creatures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant blurted out, &#34;But you just reassured him of your professionalism!&#34; &#34;Yes, I&#39;m a professional, but miracles are a different matter. I&#39;m doing all that&#39;s possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked into the surgery room, Alexander pleaded, &#34;Please, make me look as I did before. No matter what it costs, my appearance must be preserved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, the doctor nodded with a smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry Trust in my professionalism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant stood by, feeling sorry for Alexander.</p>
