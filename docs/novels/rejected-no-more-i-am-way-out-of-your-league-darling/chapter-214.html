                <p>&#34;I do harbor feelings for someone special, yet I&#39;m prepared to compromise. As the heir of an illustrious family, basking in the opulence and prestige bestowed upon me, I am ready to uphold my family&#39;s legacy without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Huntley spoke, his eyes carried the weight of an unspoken sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused to take a sip of water, her gaze drifting to Cedric, who was absorbed in his salad, seemingly oblivious to the conversation. A subtle smile graced her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Huntley, she responded, &#34;However, I refuse to coerce myself into anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley&#39;s eyebrow arched in surprise. &#34;Haven&#39;t you done exactly that in the past? Surely, you didn&#39;t actually have affection for that scumbag,Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile persisted as she responded, &#34;Indeed, I had compelled myself before, but I&#39;ve grown less willing to do so now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having tasted true freedom, it was difficult to relinquish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley was momentarily taken aback by her candor, then his lips curved into a thoughtful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meal, Cedric&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela while Huntley accompanied her home. He then casually slung his arm around Huntley&#39;s shoulders, steering him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you mean?&#34; Cedric&#39;s tone matched the intensity in his steady gaze. The memory of Huntley and Daniela laughing together lingered in his mind, stirring a sense of unease. &#34;Are you really considering pursuing Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley folded his arms, nodded thoughtfully, and stretched out his long legs across the plush sofa in the dimly lit bar. &#34;This was my family&#39;s decision. To me, the pursuit of any woman is much the same.Daniela is stunning. Not to mention wealthy. Her robotics company is burgeoning with potential, and my family holds her in high esteem.&#34; Cedric&#39;s expression grew shadowy, his brows knitting together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, Huntley took a leisurely sip of his drink and continued with a dismissive wave of his hand,&#34;They&#39;ve pretty much written me off as unable to forge my own path, so they&#39;re banking on me using my charm to land a successful partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to catch Cedric&#39;s sullen profile, Huntley bit back a chuckle. &#34;In my opinion, Daniela is a perfect fit.With her abilities and resourcefulness, the Lambert family will be in good hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Cedric whipped his head around, his voice laced with a hint of reproach. &#34;You&#39;ve prattled on enough but haven&#39;t once mentioned actually liking her. Marriage isn&#39;t a game. She&#39;s been through a divorce;it would be cruel to risk her getting hurt again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley&#39;s smile was tinged with nonchalance. &#34;Is that your worry? But who says I don&#39;t have feelings for her,or that she doesn&#39;t care for me? We had a splendid chat tonight. In fact, I&#39;ve invited her to breakfast tomorrow, and she&#39;s accepted. Cedric, you&#39;ve been into Daniela forever. If you don&#39;t take your chance and win her over, you can&#39;t blame others for stepping in, can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s frown deepened, his anger momentarily quelled by Huntley&#39;s calm retort. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in your justifications. I want to know what she thinks, what she feels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela said...&#34; Huntley paused deliberately, savoring each word as he observed Cedric&#39;s mounting frustration. &#34;I brought up the topic of marriage, and Daniela didn&#39;t dismiss it outright. I even ventured that since we&#39;re headed towards a family-arranged union anyway, it&#39;s perfectly acceptable. I vowed to honor &#39;till death do us part&#39; and not to meddle in her pursuits thereafter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s jaw clenched tightly as he demanded, &#34;What did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous chuckle, Huntley reached for a slice of watermelon from the spread before them.&#34;Hold on, I&#39;m not done yet. I proposed to Daniela that if she doesn&#39;t find someone suitable within the next month,she might as well take a chance on me. It&#39;s not unusual these days for love to blossom after getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scoffed, finding the idea ludicrous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He burst into laughter, ready to retort that Daniela would never consent to such a plan. Marrying into wealth was the least of her concerns-she already had billions to her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The decision to marry was hers alone to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could voice his thoughts, Huntley, still nibbling on his watermelon, muttered, &#34;She agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his head sharply, the smile frozen awkwardly on his face as if etched in place. &#34;What did you just say?&#34; he asked, disbelief tinting his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley&#39;s expression was the picture of innocence. &#34;I said she agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, disbelief morphing into amusement. &#34;That&#39;s impossible, utterly impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley remained silent, his attention turned to leisurely enjoying his watermelon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Often,silence served as a gentle nudge for the other to regain their composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s laughter faded, no longer able to mask his astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley bowed his head, his fingers dancing across his phone&#39;s screen. &#34;I&#39;m just sending a message to my family,sharing this good...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused midsentence as Cedric abruptly stood, the wooden chair screeching loudly against the floor as he pushed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huntley turned just in time to catch a glimpse of Cedric&#39;s departing figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Huntley sat stunned, then a soft smile played on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their circle, if joy was to find a home with any of them, Huntley wished it would be with Cedric.</p>
