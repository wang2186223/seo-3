                <p>The door flew open with a sharp crack as Elyse stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could react, Elyse struck Nina across the face with a resounding slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you even saying? What do you think you can do here? All you do is cause trouble for your cousin. Come on,let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, Elyse turned to Daniela and added, &#34;Daniela, Nina&#39;s just being childish. Please don&#39;t take it personally. I&#39;ll take her away so you can focus on your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina collapsed to the floor, her eyes filled with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved Elyse&#39;s hand away and fell to her knees at Daniela&#39;s feet. &#34;Please, help me! My mom always favors my sister and wants me to step aside for her sake.But | want to stay by your side and prove myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina repeatedly slammed her forehead onto the floor with dull thuds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, blood started to trickle from her forehead. Crimson streaks ran down her face, yet Nina, once delicate, seemed unfazed. She was resolute,determined to stay at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina understood all too clearly the fate that awaited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t fight for what she desired and failed to win Cedric&#39;s heart, she would be no better than Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce at least had Katrina to devise plans for her,but she had no one but herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this harsh world, she had to forge her own path,even if it meant stepping on anyone in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping Daniela&#39;s leg tightly, Nina pleaded, &#34;Please, I beg you.Let me stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood off to the side, her eyes burning with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She longed to strangle Nina right then and there,but her gaze landed on a reporter inside Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was grit her teeth and force another smile. &#34;Daniela, this isn&#39;t your issue. Nina&#39;s spoiled because of me. I&#39;ll take her home so she doesn&#39;t bother you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse reached out, attempting to pull Nina away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina clung desperately to Daniela&#39;s leg, preventing Elyse from moving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;It&#39;s alright. Let her stay.Nina listens well and doesn&#39;t cause me any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face immediately clouded with anger. She had planned for Natalie to make her way into Daniela&#39;s good graces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already seen through Elyse&#39;s scheme.With a serene smile, she said, &#34;I heard Natalie will be back soon from overseas. Let her join us at Elite Lux as well. We&#39;re family, after all, and the more hands,the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s smile was strained. She didn&#39;t want Nina stirrng up trouble. If Cedric fell for Nina, what would become of Natalie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since Daniela had made her decision, Elyse couldn&#39;t protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a laugh, her voice tight. &#34;Daniela, thank you.That sounds great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short time later, Elyse excused herself to use the restroom. Upon her return, she saw Nina leaving Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot Nina a cold, unfeeling look, her usual warmth replaced by disdain. &#34;So you think you can stand on your own now?&#34; Nina smiled faintly, brushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. &#34;I got a chance,and I intend to fight for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse sneered,her voice laced with disdain. &#34;You even needed my money to be admitted to a college. Do you really think Cedric would fall for someone like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina wasn&#39;t the least bit angry. Mimicking Daniela&#39;s usual composed demeanor, she replied, &#34;If you truly think Cedric won&#39;t give me a second glance, why are you so worried? I&#39;ve never understood how a mother can be so blatantly biased. It used to hurt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a small container of hand cream from her pocket, Nina applied it gently to her hands. &#34;But now,I don&#39;t bother myself with that. I can&#39;t control what you think.I can only carve my own path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, then pulled out a tissue and dabbed at the blood on her forehead right in front of Elyse. &#34;Oh, by the way, Daniela said I could move into her villa. You were planning to cut off my credit card, right? Well,go ahead. I&#39;ve got a salary now. I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was shaking with rage. She narrowed her eyes,her chest rising and falling with each labored breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina felt a surge of satisfaction. She had longed to speak her mind, and now, she had done it all in one go,relishing the feeling of triumph. No longer willing to live in Natalie&#39;s shadow, Nina was determined to make her own name and claim Cedric for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted everyone to see her worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stumbled out, nearly staggering with fury. She muttered into her phone, &#34;Natalie, get a ticket and come back now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Nina moved into the Harper family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before bed, she asked Josie, &#34;Which room does Cedric stay in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie shot her a wary look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smiled politely and said, &#34;I&#39;m not up to anything.I just don&#39;t want to get lost and cause an awkward situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s expression stayed stony as she tossed laundry into a basket. &#34;If your intentions are pure, you won&#39;t get lost. Stop looking for shortcuts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina wasn&#39;t offended at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d endured far worse from the Dury family, and these small gestures didn&#39;t bother her in the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smniled softly and said, &#34;You&#39;re overthinking things. I really don&#39;t have any ulterior motives. If you&#39;d prefer not to say, that&#39;s fine. Looks like your hands are busy,and you haven&#39;t taken good care of them.&#34; Nina pulled out a small tube of hand cream from her pocket and handed it to Josie. &#34;This brand works well.Give it a try. If you like it and run out, just let me know.I&#39;ll get you more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she walked towards the guest room across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie looked at the hand cream on the table, her brow furrowing into a thoughtful frown.</p>
