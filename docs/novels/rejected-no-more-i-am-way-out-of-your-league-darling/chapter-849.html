                <p>Hamilton intended to reveal to the world that day that Cedric was his son, offering him formal recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, Cedric might find some balance against the ache of losing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man with status, wealth, and power, finding company was seldom a struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton held firmn belief in the power he had built through the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t sure how Hamilton planned to keep Cedric busy, but he knew Daniela&#39;s weakness wasn&#39;t a fear of heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Hamilton&#39;s scheme truly unfolded as planned...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes dimmed as he turned to his secretary.&#34;Get me a bag of fresh blood. I&#39;ll need it this weekend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary answered, &#34;It&#39;s tricky to get fresh blood past the security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family sat at the pinnacle of Oiscoll&#39;s elite,their influence stretching far and wide. For Hamilton&#39;s birthday, the city&#39;s most powerful and prestigious would gather under one roof</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entry involved a full search, and carrying something as obvious as fresh blood would draw immediate suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused briefly, then told the secretary,&#34;Bring me a small fruit knife-something discreet and easy to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary looked confused. &#34;Didn&#39;t Mr. McCoy say Daniela feared heights? You could simply take her to the rooftop. Why would you need a knife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander offered no explanation. &#34;Just do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton fretted over whether Daniela and Cedric would even bother showing up to his birthday banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cornered Nikolas and Damon. &#34;If Daniela and Cedric don&#39;t show up on my birthday and make me look like a fool, you two will pay for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added dismissively, &#34;It&#39;s just a party. What&#39;s there to fear? I&#39;m not going to bite their heads off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon still hesitated, a flicker of doubt in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton stood firm, exuding his usual air of command and unshakable authority. &#34;Cut the crap and bring them here!&#34; Nikolas and Damon returned and stood before Daniela,relaying Hamilton&#39;s message in hushed, cautious tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right. What time should we be there?&#34; Daniela asked calmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shifted uncomfortably, worry flickering in his eyes. &#34;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up with a teasing smile. &#34;What&#39;s this?You&#39;re not scared of your father anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave a half-hearted shrug. &#34;He&#39;s always angry anyway.One more reason won&#39;t make a difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a gentle reassurance. &#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; She had intended to face Hamilton sooner or later. She needed to confirm the real culprit for her mother&#39;s death and the explosion; she didn&#39;t want to go after the wrong person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton&#39;s birthday arrived, the group made their appearance at the lavish celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked visibly pleased. &#34;Daniela,you must try this red wine l just uncorked-it&#39;s absolutely divine.&#34; As he spoke, he exchanged a glance with Alexander,then his gaze settled on Cedric. He gave a slow nod,clearly pleased with what he saw. Cedric struck him as a mirror of his younger self-calm under pressure, razor-sharp, and unmistakably gifted in business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Cedric&#39;s name had been buzzing through Oiscoll&#39;s business circles with praise-and that filled Hamilton with a quiet pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stood off to the side, finding Hamilton&#39;s satisfied smile somewhat sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,&#34; Hamilton said with a faint smile, &#34;I&#39;d like a word with you in private. Join me in my study later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen tensed at once. &#34;Father!&#34; he blurted out,alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t spare Kohen a glance. His gaze stayed fixed on Cedric. &#34;You&#39;re my son. It&#39;s my birthday. You wouldn&#39;t turn me down, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t care much for birthdays-least of all Hamilton&#39;s. The only reason he&#39;d come was because Daniela had her plans, and he didn&#39;t want her going alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The place is crawling with reporters. You wouldn&#39;t let your old man lose face, would you, Cedric? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got no tricks up my sleeve. I&#39;m seventy,you&#39;re my son What harm could I possibly mean?Besides, it&#39;s my birthday. What harm could I possibly bring you today? Believe me, as your father, all I want</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is what&#39;s best for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said flatly, &#34;No need for the study. If you&#39;ve got something to say,say it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no intention of making things easy for Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t take offense. He smiled instead.&#34;That temper-just like mine when I was your age. Fine. I&#39;ll bring the lawyer later, and we&#39;ll find somewhere nearby to talk in peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning was unmistakable-Hamilton intended to formally acknowledge Cedric as his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stared at Cedric, jealousy brewing. Their father had never used such a soft tone with any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Cedric the exception?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burned in Kohen&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banquet soon kicked off in full swing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hall buzzed with chatter,Hamilton&#39;s secretary appeared to escort Cedric. Cedric turned to Daniela.&#34;Come with me.&#34; He wasn&#39;t comfortable leaving her by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, someone accidentally spilled red wine on Carol&#39;s dress, leaving a vivid stain across the fabric. Daniela said, &#34;You go on ahead. I&#39;ll help Carol change,then I&#39;ll come find you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was just about to follow when Hamilton&#39;s secretary gave a courteous smile. &#34;It&#39;s not quite appropriate for you to accompany a lady while she&#39;s changing. Why don&#39;t you head on ahead? Mr. McCoy is waiting. We&#39;re all here at the banquet. Nothing&#39;s going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon and Nikolas nodded. &#34;Go on, Cedric. We&#39;re here with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave Daniela a lingering look. &#34;Once you&#39;re done,come find me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary chuckled. &#34;You two are quite the couple.&#34;Then he led Cedric off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,as Carol stepped into a room to change,Nikolas and Damon were stopped at the door. A female attendant smiled politely. &#34;Only ladies inside,sirs. I&#39;m afraid it wouldn&#39;t be proper for you to go in.&#34;</p>
