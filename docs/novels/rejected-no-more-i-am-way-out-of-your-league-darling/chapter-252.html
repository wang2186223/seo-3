                <p>Shirley tilted her head to look at Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina began to share her strategies for captivating Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to use strengths, Shirley. You&#39;re attractive and beautiful, but you have one flaw: you&#39;re too proud.You may attract those less fortunate men, but high-ranking men don&#39;t appreciate women like that. They prefer women who are simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley was doubtful upon hearing this. &#34;Really? I think Cedric actually prefers proud women. Look at how reserved Daniela is; he always makes the first move with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know?&#34; Katrina scoffed. &#34;Are you Daniela? Do you have the brains to be a CEO like her at Elite Lux? Or are you as beautiful as Daniela? You have nothing to boast about, yet you refuse to be humble.What advantage do you have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley pressed her lips together. She knew how to attract men, but she was unsure how to approach someone as brilliant as Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s position was too high, unlike the men she could easily enchant with a simple smile. Except for Daniela,nothing seemed to catch his interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, during Caiden and Katrina&#39;s argument, the living room was buzzing with whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was an exception. He didn&#39;t spare a glance for Caiden and Katrina; his eyes were fixed on Daniela,showing such deep admiration that Shirley felt a chill of hopelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she stood no chance.	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cedric seemed too ideal, his status high, like the moon unreachable in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gentle attention towards Daniela sparked envy in her; she longed for such devotion for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting her teeth, Shirley said to Katrina, &#34;I&#39;ll try once more, but I may need your assistance.&#34; As she finished speaking, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce walked in with a look of displeasure, and Katrina could see she had faced mistreatment by the Bennett family once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Katrina&#39;s attempt to pair Shirley with Cedric had been merely an experiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, if Joyce was indeed unsuccessful with the Bennett family, Katrina realized she would depend entirely on Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly devised a strategy and assured Shirley. &#34;Alright, I&#39;Il work with you on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded, her smile returning, and then she headed to the courtyard to call her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandmother possessed an aphrodisiac that, once consumed, induced a strong physical urge, relieved only by having sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aphrodisiac was powerful, needing just a small amount to be effective, and it was harmless, even beneficial to one&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was aware that Shirley planned to request this special aphrodisiac from her family. Joyce sat on the living room couch, sneering with disdain in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, visibly irritated, asked, &#34;What&#39;s the matter with you today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think? Alexander hasn&#39;t come home again. He was seen flirting with a celebrity on camera yesterday. Just look at the man you chose for me! I could have picked anyone in Olisvine and been better off.Do you know what people are saying about me? Even the servants of the Bennett family think I&#39;m like a forgotten wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes drifted to Shirley in the courtyard, her emotions in turmoil, and she vented her frustration on Katrina. &#34;Are you even my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed and asked, &#34;Why the sarcasm? What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gestured towards Shirley outside. &#34;Why do you let Shirley try to win over Cedric, but you forced me to marry Alexander? Why?&#34; Everyone knew that Cedric was far superior to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I had married Cedric, I&#39;m sure he would have treated me well and never hurt me. Mom, I&#39;m your daugter.Why would you offer such a good man to someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina retorted, &#34;Joyce, do you have any conscience? Didn&#39;t I encourage you to go after Cedric? You failed on your own, and now you blame me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was visibly exhausted. &#34;You never reflect on yourself. Why do you always hold me responsible for everything? I think I&#39;ve spoiled you far too much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had endured enough disrespectful stares from others recently. The last thing she expected was harsh criticism from Katrina at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost control, hurling objects around the house in her fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stormed out, she cast a heartbroken look at Katrina. &#34;People say that once a daughter is married,she&#39;s no longer part of her original family. I never grasped that until now. It seems I&#39;m not as dear to you as your niece!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Joyce left, left a trail of mess behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden came downstairs, saw the chaos, and remained silent, as if unconcerned. He stepped around,avoiding the debris, turned on the television, and settled down to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Shirley returned indoors, she exchanged a glance with Katrina and gave a subtle nod. She whispered to Katrina, &#34;My mom said she&#39;ll send it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gazed at Shirley and felt that her future hopes now rested upon her.</p>
