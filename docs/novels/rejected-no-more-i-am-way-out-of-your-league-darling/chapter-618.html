                <p>As Daniela received the alert about complications in Elite Lux&#39;s business operations back home, her plans to return to her country were already in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resolute spirit, she was prepared to rebuild and continue from where she had left off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her departure, she sought solace at a tranquil retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! I&#39;m yearning to return as well!&#34; Lillian said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel the same way!&#34; Ryan echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at the two people lying in the hospital beds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three long years had drifted by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They,like her,had been ensnared in the silent grip of comas for those years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared that her emergence from the depths of unconsciousness had pulled them along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the outside world,they were declared dead. &#34;Ryan, Lillian, prioritize your recovery now. Your time to return will come,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosion back then had happened so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With guards stationed at every turn, the estate was a fortress, nearly impenetrable to outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, shockingly, an explosion ripped through the estate-a clear indication of insider involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only individuals with unrestricted access were Ryan, Lillian, Daniela herself, and Cedric. No one else could have breezed in and out undetected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, after examining the remnants of the estate,confirmed that the bomb was exceptionally powerful.Its detonation left no chance of survival for anyone nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the perpetrator was someone close,who could harbor such malice towards her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before concluding her investigation, she decided to keep Ryan and Lillian&#39;s survival a secret, opting not to expose them to further peril.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,how can you even think of going back there alone?&#34; Lillian protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s downright reckless!&#34; Ryan added. With a wave of her hand, Daniela reassured them.&#34;Fear not, I&#39;ve learned my lesson. This time, my vigilance will be unshakable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was resolute in her determination to exact retribution on those who sought her demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the cloak of secrecy, Daniela departed without drawing any attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very day, she bid farewell to the bustling headquarters of Elite Lux and boarded a plane back to her homeland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the Elite Lux building, Caiden bellowed, &#34;I am Daniela&#39;s biological father. Everything she owns including this building, rightfully belongs to me! Now that she&#39;s presumed dead, all of it is mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood at the edge of a high floor in the building, her gaze fixed on the frenzied man below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, the security captain&#39;s face was a canvas of raw emotion. &#34;Ms. Harper, it&#39;s a miracle! You&#39;re alive!This is truly wonderful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Daniela asked, &#34;Is he out there every single day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security captain nodded vigorously,his frustration palpable. &#34;Absolutely, every day since that dreadful rumor of your death was broadcasted. He was rather cautious at first, probably intimidated by your husband.But as soon as gossip flew that your husband was comatose and beyond hope, his audacity knew no bounds. He contacted the media, lawyers, and even the underworld. Proclaiming that you left no heirs, and with your husband supposedly on his deathbed, he argued that all of your assets should fall into his lap.When his plans failed and his pockets were emptied,he resorted to showing up here, unleashing his fury on you and your husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes turned cold. It seemed a lot had happened during her three-year coma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more,&#34; the security captain continued,his tone grave. &#34;A woman named Joyce emerged from the shadows, claiming to be your sister. She&#39;s been in cahoots with Caiden, scheming to liquidate Elite Lux.Joyce hasn&#39;t shown up these past few days,probably busy contacting buyers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, his expression solemn, then added,&#34;Given the swirling rumors of your demise and Elite Lux&#39;s rumored financial troubles, many of our projects have &#39;ground to a halt, and wages have gone unpaid. Yet,the staff&#39;s gratitude for your past benevolence has kept them from deserting. Your return is nothing short of a miracle for us all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his eyes glistening with tears, the security captain wiped his face yet again. Daniela spoke softly, her words laced with sincerity.&#34;Please express my deepest thanks to everyone for their unwavering loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security captain, his resolve now steel-hard,wiped his eyes for the last time, fists balled in determination. &#34;Ms. Harper, with you here, I have no doubts-we will turn the tide. And as for that agitator below, I&#39;ll ensure he troubles us no more.&#34;</p>
