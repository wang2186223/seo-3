                <p>Katrine&#39;s gaze remalned fixed on Daniela. &#34;Daniela,I know we&#39;ve had so many misunderstandings in the past. That&#39;s on me, and I&#39;l take full responsibility. You can blame me all you want, but please, don&#39;t take it out on Joyce. She&#39;s still young. Can you help her? Please?&#34; Hope flickered in her eyes as she looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Daniela could réspond, Cedric&#39;s voice sliced through the air. &#34;Still young? Joyce is an adult, isn&#39;t she? Do you think you can push Daniela around just because you assume she has no one to defend her? Let me make one thing clear-Daniela has people protecting her. Don&#39;t drag your family&#39;s mess into herlife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina opened her mouth to argue, but Cedric didn&#39;t give her the chance. &#34;Josie!&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie emerged from the kitchen, carrying a knife and pointing it to Katrina&#39;s face. &#34;Yes, Mr. Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from Katrina&#39;s cheeks, leaving her pale and trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, they&#39;d lost their minds. All of them!②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, seeing no other way, tried to stall for time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the top lawyer from Elite Lux could help craft a strategy. But Cedric wasn&#39;t about to give her that opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience snapped. &#34;Don&#39;t come any closer. My tolerance for this nonsense is wearing thin. If you dare to take advantage of Daniela again, I&#39;ll buy out Harper Group tomorrow, and you&#39;ll find yourself thrown out of this house.&#34;③</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit like a sledgehammer, and Katrina, consumed by fear,grabbed Joyce&#39;s arm and dragged her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several days passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s secretary stepped into the house. &#34;Mr. Bennett&#39;s message is clear-draggingthis out is Katrina stared at the divorce agreement and was about to say something when Joyce burst out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to accept the harsh reality, she ran straight to Alexander&#39;s car and knocked on the tinted window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not the type to cling shamelessly. Get out here and let&#39;s talk. If you stil want the divorce after that, fine -we&#39;ll get divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car door opened, and Alexander stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he stood in front of her, it became clear-Joyce had no intention of letting him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept talking about her hardships and how hard it was to be in a marriage without love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, l&#39;ve already been judged for having a child out of wedlock. If you divorce me now, how am l supposed to face anyone? How will I ever marry again? I know you&#39;re still upset about what happened last time, but it was only because I love you. You married me but never touched me. Do you know what people say? They call me tainted, damaged. Have you ever thought about how that makes me feel? This marriage can&#39;t work if I&#39;m the only one trying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s tears fell freely now. She recited lines she had carefully rehearsed over the past few days,clinging to the hope that they might soften his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not divorce. Let&#39;s go back home and make this work. Please.&#34; For the first time since their marriage,Joyce adopted a posture of complete humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought that as long as she admitted her mistakes, Alexander would reconsider. But she was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light of the evening, Alexander stood before her like an immovable mountain. His presence was cold, his expression distant. &#34;I don&#39;t like you. We&#39;re not suited for each other, and forcing this will only lead to misery for both of us. I can&#39;t do this anymore. This marriage has to end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hadn&#39;t imagined that even after lowering herself so much, Alexander would remain utterly unyielding.A flicker of anger crossed her face, but she forced it down, masking her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I know you&#39;re still furious about what happened before, but I swear it won&#39;t happen again. I&#39;ll apologize to the one I hurt. I&#39;ll even make up for the Bennett family&#39;s losses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could cut her off, she rushed to speak again, her voice trembling. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Don&#39;t say anything. I&#39;m going back inside now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and hurried away, her steps uneven and rushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained rooted in place, exhaling a long, weary sigh. As he moved to return to his car,faint footsteps caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the sound, he saw Daniela walking a small dog. The bell on its collar jingled, its gentle chime breaking the stillness of the dusky evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight pressing on Alexander&#39;s chest seemed to lift, his earlier frustration dissolving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on Daniela as she crouched down to scoop up the lively dog. She smiled as it wriggled in her arms, its fur brushing against her cheek as if it were sharing a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh, light and melodic, carried through the air as she murmured, &#34;Why are you being such a little troublemaker today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander knew he shouldn&#39;t approach her. He&#39;d told himself that before-the last time he&#39;d seen her at the dinner party. But just like then, restraint slipped through his fingers. &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Daniela&#39;s lips gradually faded. She gently placed thedog on the ground, her grip on the leash steady, her face unreadable. &#34;Mr. Bennett.&#34; Her tone was formal, distant-like a stranger addressing someone they barely knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s chest tightened with a sharp ache. &#34;Do you really need to be so cold? You used to call me Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s eyes drifted to the dog instead, her attention shifting away as if his words hadn&#39;t even reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must have heard by now,&#34; he continued, his voice softer, almost pleading. &#34;I&#39;m divorcing Joyce. The details are already being sorted out.&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t flinch; her expression remained like stone, distant and detached. She kept her hold on the leash and took a step forward, her intention to leave clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander panicked and followed, his steps quick to match hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped suddenly, her sharp gaze locking onto himn like ice. &#34;Alexander, do you hold some kind of grudge against me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath hitched at her unexpected question. &#34;L...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your divorce from Joyce has nothing to do with me. Stop trying to involve me in this mess. I want no part in your drama or your love life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth to respond, but she interrupted him again, her tone dripping with disdain.&#34;Frankly, I find it revolting.&#34;</p>
