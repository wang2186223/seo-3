                <p>Katrina asserted with conviction, &#34;Blame it on me. After áll, I&#39;m Joyce&#39;s mother,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed quiet, her attention turning back to the television as she nibbled or her apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pleaded for a long time, even writing a guarantee letter, before Daniela finally relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful, Katrina showered her with thanks. &#34;We&#39;re family, after all. I always knew you had a soft heart,Daniela, far mnore understanding than Joyce.&#34; She then headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain that without financial support, Milo would leave Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything would then revert to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce stormed in, Johan was attempting to hypnotize Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden intrusion caused Johan to jump, disrupting the hypnosis-it was ineffective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Johan harbored resentment, Joyce&#39;s overbearing nature overshadowed his feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With determined strides, she closed the distance to Daniela, her tone laced with frustration. &#34;Why haven&#39;t |received the dividends yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela propped her chin on her hand and glanced at Katrina, who recoiled slightly. &#34;We&#39;re facing some operational challenges, so the dividends are on hold for now. Is there an issue with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Joyce faltered, her haughty demeanor softening slightly. &#34;But the payments were made every five days before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps they were, but that&#39;s not the case now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see no point in repeating myself. Were you not able to grasp what | said?&#34; Joyce&#39;s arrogance crumbled even more, her voice faltering. &#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts, Joyce. Have you forgotten that you&#39;re merely a minor shareholder? Or has the company&#39;s support made you lose sight of your place here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, any trace of arrogance left i Joyce evaporated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan watched,utterly fascinated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had the uncanny ability to sway emotions effortlessly. With just a handful of words, she had left Joyce deflated and defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, clearly upset, protested, &#34;But you can&#39;t completely halt the distributions. We all have emergencies to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, who had been a silent observer, was surprised by Daniela&#39;s tactfulness in not outing her involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Joyce lose her edge, Katrina got up with a steady gaze. &#34;Joyce, enough of this nonsense. The company must make its own decisions. How dare you challenge Daniela&#39;s management? You should be more mindful of expenses. The company&#39;s growth is paramount. Besides, owning such a minor share,why the fuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This statement made Joyce frown deeply. She bit back her rage, knowing better than to lose it in front of Daniela now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, she pulled Katrina aside to the doorway and then burst out. &#34;Mom, what was that about? Were you really taking Daniela&#39;s side just now? What the hell is wrong with you? Remember, I loaned you that eight million. Well, since you believe it&#39;s all for the company, you might as well give it back. I need it back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat of Katrina&#39;s rage burned through her piercing stare. &#34;Have you lost your mind, squandering money on a gigolo? Didn&#39;t I make it clear what that money was for? And now you have the nerve to ask for more?Do you still covet what Daniela has?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp glare, Joyce fired back, &#34;I&#39;ve given up on that. I just want Milo. It&#39;s been days since he last took my calls. Just give me the money!&#34;Katrina&#39;s hands trembled with fury. The thought that her daughter was being manipulated by a man fifled her with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing left! Joyce, I&#39;m warning you! Dump that worthless Milo, or don&#39;t bother calling mé your mother ever again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those Tinal words, Katrina whirled around and stormed back into the villa, slamming the door with such force that it made Johan startle in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela remained engrossed in the television,utterly indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the door, Katrina gazed at Daniela&#39;s composed figure and felt a surge of frustration. Why couldn&#39;t she have a daughter as remarkable as Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was her own daughter ensnared in foolishness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the dreams she had harbored for Joyce crumbled to dust, all her efforts rendered futile.</p>
