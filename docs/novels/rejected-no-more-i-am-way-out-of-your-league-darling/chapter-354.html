                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw, refusing to say/a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride wouldn&#39;t let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a soft laugh, clearly enjoying every second of his discomfort without any rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile, she walked closer and started to undress him. First, she slid off his jacket, then unbuttoned his shirt, and finally reached for the belt on his trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp &#34;click&#34; of the belt buck&lt;le seemed to hit a nerve, echoing in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Alexander&#39;s hand shot up, holding the belt in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce laughed again, teasing, &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Her fingers easily brushed his hand aside.&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve forgotten your brilliant plan to save Bennett Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze burned, his eyes streaked with anger and shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer humiliation coursing through him left him trembling faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smirk grew wider as she smoothly pulled the belt free. &#34;You really should&#39;ve considered all this before stepping into my world, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lingered as her hand glided over Alexander&#39;s firm stomach, fingers lingering just above his waistband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her fingers inched lower, Alexander&#39;s hand shot out and gripped her wrist firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s crooked smile stayed in place, unbothered. She was in no rush, quietly watching and waiting to see how Alexander would respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait.&#34; His face reddened as he hastily gathered his clothes, dressed, and bolted from the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved quickly, his pace frantic, like a man fleeing something he couldn&#39;t face. The moment her hand started to move lower, a sudden vision of Daníela filled his mind. At that moment, he realized he no longer cared about being the CEO of Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild thought took hold of him-he wanted Daniela more than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing else mattered; he&#39;d sacrifice everything just to have</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t accept the idea that they&#39;d keep slipping away from each other forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Alexander reached Elite Lux, Daniela had already left, and Cedric was sitting comfortably in her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian, meanwhile, was completely consumed by the code that was making him lose his mind. He insisted Daniela&#39;s office was his creative haven and vowed not to budge until he solved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Teetering on the edge of a breakdown, Killian was glaring at the endless lines of code when Alexander strode in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted to Alexander the second he entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured as he narrowed his eyes, clearly unimpressed by Alexander&#39;s appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34; Alexander demanded. Cedric&#39;s smile felt like a dagger to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This should have been his life! Yet here was Cedric, the outsider, sitting smugly, having stolen it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Alexander thought about it, the more his mind darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric wasn&#39;t in the picture, maybe Daniela would come back to him. Could they find their way back to what they once had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by this thought, Alexander&#39;s glare hardened as he spat, &#34;Phillips, don&#39;t you have your own office?Showing up here is bad enough, but dragging someone else along? You think Daniela&#39;s foo polite to throw you out, so you&#39;ve just decided to overstay your welcome, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t the type to back down from a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never cared for Alexander, but he chose to remain civil for one reason only. He didn&#39;t want Daniela&#39;s decade-long commitment to Alexander to seem utterly meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped they could go their separate ways with grace. Yet, Alexander had a knack for testing limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you even think you are?&#34; Killian was the first to snap. &#34;Alexander, I&#39;m so done with your nonsense.Everyone knows you sold yourself to Joyce for cash. What now? She kicked you to the curb, and you&#39;ve come crawling back to Daniela? Have you no shame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words hit Alexander like a punch to the gut-it was the one thing he didn&#39;t want to face. A dark look crossed his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t you ever say that again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian stood his ground, unbothered by Alexander&#39;s threat.&#34;Oh,,did I lie? Can you honestly deny selling yourself to Joyce for cash? Everyone in Olisvie knows by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tightened his fists and took a step towards him, full of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised a hand, blocking his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s glare shifted to Cedric instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Cedric met Alexander&#39;s hostility with ease and said, &#34;Joyce spilled the beans herself. She&#39;s even spreading videos of you two in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Alexander like a blow. His eyes.widened, and his face went pale.&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian, standing behind Cedric, called out with a smirk, &#34;Come on, Alexander, stop acting tough.Joyce even made a group chat to make fun of your lack of skills in bed. Weren&#39;t you the golden boy once? Didn&#39;t all those women adore you? Now they can grab an uncensored video of you and Joyce in bed for just five bucks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian gestured towards the screen. &#34;Want proof? I can hack into Joyce&#39;s files and give you a free peek.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stumbled, barely managing to stay upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So everyone saw him serving Joyce in bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Daniela seen it as well? What could she possibly think of him now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she feel hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she look at him with disappointment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of emotions churned inside Alexander&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric watched Alexander&#39;s face shift between shock and despair, then spoke evenly. &#34;She knows. But she didn&#39;t care enough to say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was the plain truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was the first to stumble across the leaked videos and had shown them to Daniela&#39;s driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the driver was watching, Daniela accidentally heard the audio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver quickly apologized, and the car raced down the road in awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried about losing his job for watching such videos on duty, the driver pleaded with Ryan to speak to Cedric on his behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they were discussing the issue, Daniela happened to pass by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric addressed it head-on, explaining the driver&#39;s concerns to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chimed in, &#34;Honestly, Joyce is brutal. Filming that secretly and airing it everywhere? Now everyone knows Alexander stooped so low for money.Crystal-clear footage, too. Imagine being that proud and falling this far. If it were me, I&#39;d just disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, he kept sneaking glances at Daniela, eager to gauge her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric trusted Daniela entirely. Yet, even he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how she truly felt about all this.Because, in the end, she mattered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if the woman he&#39;d finally won over was slipping away?</p>
