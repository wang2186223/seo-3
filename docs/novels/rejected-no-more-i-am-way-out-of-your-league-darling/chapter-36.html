                <p>Daniela shivered, a wave of goose bumps spreading across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s forehead creased, and in a sharp, icy tone,he replied,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce opened her mouth to argue, but before she could, Cedric&#39;s face hardened. &#34;I have germaphobia,&#34;he stated plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood stock-still.Her eyes immediately began to fill withtears. What was he trying to say? Was he suggesting she was dirty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Joyce was about to speak, Daniela raised her hand and pointed to the door. &#34;Alright, time to leave.Your parents have already gone.How about you hurry up and catch up with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce scowled,glaring at Daniela like her eyes could scorch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an angry stomp, she marched out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked away, two tears slipped down her face -tears so raw and vulnerable they would have softened the heart of any ordinary man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric barely reacted. His frown deepened, and his attention turned back to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, locking eyes with Cedric&#39;s intense,thoughtful gaze. She smiled. &#34;What&#39;s thematter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric just stared at her, saying nothing. She looked as lively and glowing as she had the day they first met,but now there was something different-something that caused a faint ache in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing, let&#39;s go,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had lunch at an upscale restaurant. Through the whole meal, Cedric barely spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention never strayed from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peeled shrimp, cracked crabs, and even cut the salmon sashimi for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela savored the food but couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Cedric&#39;s quietness was unusual. Something seemed to be bothering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Cedric passed Daniela a plate of fruit.Smiling,she asked,&#34;Is something bothering you today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed her a slice of juicy watermelon and answered simply, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, choosing not to press him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Cedric set down the damp towel, his eyes lowering for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he said, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him, seeing the seriousness in his eyes,and hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Daniela broke the silence. She looked away, took another bite of the watermelon, and gave a small smile. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric opened his mouth, Daniela set her napkin down, stood up, and flashed a casual smile. &#34;I&#39;m full. I&#39;ll be right back,&#34; she said, heading towards the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric watched her walk away, the spark in his eyes fading with each step she took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was surprised to see Alexander waiting for her when she came out of the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She meant to walk past him without a word, but Alexander held up his hand, stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He likes you,&#34; he said, his voice firm and certain. He was talking about Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Alexander had caught wind of something-maybe from the half-open door or the thin walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the timing had been different,&#34; he continued,&#34;you&#39;d know exactly what Cedric was going to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small laugh, though her face showed a flash of irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harper family had already stirred enough trouble,and she wasn&#39;t in the mood to deal with Alexander now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in the hallway, standing tall in her sleek high heels, and locked eyes with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was flat as she asked, &#34;So what? Mr.Bennett,why does it concern you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face turned serious. &#34;It&#39;s none of my business. But I&#39;ll tell you this-Cedric has big plans.He has a reason for coming after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t hold back another laugh at his words Her voice dripped with sarcasm. &#34;Oh really? Cedric has an agenda? And what about you? What&#39;s your plan?What makes you think you&#39;re in a position to give me advice? What part are you playing in this? Are you saying you don&#39;t have a plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking at him again, Daniela spun around and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood still, his eyes cold and full of dark intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine, he thought with a bitter edge. If she couldn&#39;t see his good intentions, then she&#39;d face the consequences when the time came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stepped back into the private room,her eyes instantly found Cedric. One glance told her he had regained his usual calm demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as she approached him. &#34;Ready to go?lf you are,let&#39;s head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove Daniela home in his car, pulling up in front of her building. She thanked him before getting out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to walk away, Cedric called out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed quietly to herself before turning around slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she did, Cedric had already gotten out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was standing by the car, his expression more serious than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re smart. You must have some idea of what I want to say. I know now isn&#39;t the right moment or the right situation to say it. So for now,just think of me as an old classmate, a friend, or whatever label works for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, his eyes steady and sincere.&#34;I just want you to know, if you ever need help-anything at all, please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he continued, &#34;And one more thing. You&#39;re a good person, Daniela. The problem isn&#39;t you-it&#39;s them. Don&#39;t be upset because of someone who doesn&#39;t deserve you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold breeze swept through the street, carrying a hint of chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood motionless, her long hair flowing gently in the breeze. A faint smile graced her lips-subtle,yet captivating in its charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t often that Cedric-the ever-composed and calculating man,renowned for his sharp strategies and icy demeanor-opened up like this. Yet here he was,speaking so openly, his words carrying genuine emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Daniela said, her voice warm with sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really don&#39;t need to thank me,&#34; Cedric said almost instantly, his gaze resting on her with a hint of uncertainty. There were so many things he wanted to say,so much he wanted to do for her, but he held back, fearing he might push too far and scare her off.Finally, he just said, &#34;If your housekeeper decides to leave, don&#39;t worry about it. I know an excellent housekeeper who&#39;s currently looking for work. I could introduce her to you tomorrow if that works for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could say anything, Cedric quickly added, &#34;She&#39;s already searching for a job, so honestly,you&#39;d be doing her a favor. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes settled on the man standing opposite her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chiseled features and commanding presence radiated confidence and strength. But in his eyes,there was a soft hesitation, almost a fragility, as if he was bracing himself for rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a soft, reassuring smile. &#34;You don&#39;t need to do that.&#34; It had only been three months since her divorce, and her focus had remained firmly on her own priorities. If it had been someone else, she likely would&#39;ve dismissed them without a second thought.But this was Cedric-her old classmate, the one who had always been there for her with quiet,unwavering support.
