                <p>Hackett was overwhelmed by the barrage of complaints. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to face these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commerce association had flourished for years.Each company contributed ten million annually in sponsorship fees, and new entrants paid an additional fifty million as an initiation fee. These funds alone allowed Hackett to live extravagantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, the members, who were either wealthy or influential, frequently sought his favor to secure new business opportunities for financial gain,reputation,or profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The potential mass withdrawal of these companies posed a severe threat to Hackett&#39;s lifestyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understandably, he was not prepared to let go without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hiding for half theday, he eventually emerged,exuding a forced confidence as he approached the agitated crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who here is considering leaving the association? Those wishing to leave, please proceed to register with the secretary now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his directive, the members rushed towards the secretary&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, hands clasped behind his back, clenched his fists nervously,though he appeared composed. &#34;But before you decide to leave, listen to what I have to say. Think carefully about future regrets. If you&#39;re certain you won&#39;t have any, then you&#39;re free to withdraw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Hackett&#39;s enigmatic attitude, the crowd paused,uncertain of their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno interjected from the side, &#34;Hackett, just speak plainly. We&#39;re supposed to be like a family here;there&#39;s no need for such secrecy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett looked around at the crowd and sneered,&#34;Really? Do you still see me as your president? I&#39;ve dedicated myself to guiding us towards success, yet now you question my leadership. If you want to leave,then go-forget all the efforts I&#39;ve put in over the years!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One member stepped forward and asked Hackett,&#34;What exactly do you mean?&#34; Hackett, seizing the moment, continued to act mysteriously,suggesting he held a secret too sensitive to disclose, which only heightened the group&#39;s curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley, observing the tense atmosphere, caught Hackett&#39;s gaze briefly. He gave a slight nod and declared, &#34;Well, if Hackett won&#39;t explain, I will. You&#39;ve all disappointed Hackett deeply! Are you aware of all he&#39;s planned for your benefit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd exchanged puzzled looks upon hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley continued,&#34;Daniela is quite influential, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd unanimously agreed.&#34;Absolutely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she&#39;s also quite arrogant. She once approached Hackett with a condition for joining the association-only if certain members were removed. From her demeanor, it was clear she intended to take over your businesses. This wasn&#39;t about Hackett or any of us initially. The companies facing eviction wouldn&#39;t include any of the eight of us. Yet, out of loyalty to all of you, Hackett still tried to negotiate with Daniela.Consider this; Hackett is not only a senior but also a figure of respect here, and yet, he humbled himself before Daniela to plead on your behalf. Even more remarkably, he knelt before her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was taken aback. &#34;Daniela was that bold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve already made settlements, and she&#39;s still unyielding? The market is huge, how can she manage everything by herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right! So, leaving the association won&#39;t protect us from her,will it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the tension rose, Hackett let out a deep sigh.&#34;That&#39;s precisely my concern. Think about it; even together, we struggle against Daniela. If we split up,wouldn&#39;t the local market become even more susceptible,essentially handing it over to her? Do you really want that to happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd,motivated by Hackett&#39;s words, responded at the same time, &#34;No,we don&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett nodded and responded, &#34;I thought so. The association hears you. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided to reduce the annual fee from ten million to one million during this challenging time, as a sign of our support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This prompted a murmur of disagreement among some attendees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loss of nine million per person was significant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would invest in the association if not for profit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett reassured the group with a confident look, saying, &#34;Furthermore, the association will also lower its entry requirements. Companies with an annual revenue of just ten million can now join us without an entry fee; they&#39;ll only need to pay the annual fee. Plus,the person who introduces a new member will receive a bonus of one hundred thousand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This announcement sparked renewed discussion among the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other seven, sensing Hackett&#39;s strategy, silently applauded him with thumbs-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although they lowered the annual fee and cut the entry fee, there would be more companies joining them. And they could unify these new members against Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela was no longer a factor, wouldn&#39;t the local market be theirs for the taking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, seizing the moment, stood and declared, &#34;We are honest with you, and we ask for your support in eliminating this threat to our market, paving the way for fair competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, filled with excitement, eagerly worked to bring in new members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, news of the association lowering its entry barriers dominated the headlines.</p>
