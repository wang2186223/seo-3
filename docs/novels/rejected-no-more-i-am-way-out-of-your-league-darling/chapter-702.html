                <p>Kohen shrugged it off. &#34;You worry too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Charles McCoy rushed in from Oiscoll,catching Kohen off guard. &#34;Charles? What are you doing here? I was just about to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life here felt too dull. By eleven, Daniela had to be asleep. The house stayed quiet, and Kohen couldn&#39;t adjust to her early nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already packed, ready to head out. But then Charles showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stormed in, voice sharp with anger.&#34;We need to get rid of Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen glanced at Nikolas, then turned to Charles.&#34;What are you talking about? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t hold back. &#34;Dad is getting  bring Cedric into the family. He&#39;s giving Cedric the best villa and setting Cedric up at the company, too.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened. &#34;Dad plans to make Cedric the vice president.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Is that true? Dad&#39;s the president, and he wants Cedric to be the vice president?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles chimed in, &#34;Everyone at the company knows about it. They&#39;re all saying Dad&#39;s going to hand over McCoy Group to Cedric, like he&#39;s the rightful heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles lowered his tone, causing Nikolas and Kohen to lean in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles continued, &#34;Dad had the lawyer over-the one who handles the family assets. They were shut in the study for over three hours. Think about how much could have changed in that time. We&#39;ve given everything to this family, and now, just as the inheritance talks begin, Cedric shows up to take it all.Are you really okay with that? If we don&#39;t deal with him now, what&#39;s stopping him from taking control of McCoy Group and turning against us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas turned pale. His voice was shaky as he said,&#34;There&#39;s something Dad might still be in the dark about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Kohen and Charles turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked pale ashe admitted, &#34;I hired Ghost to take Cedric out, but he failed. He ended up back in Oiscoll for treatment. When he woke up,I asked who attacked him.He said it was Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words came out, Kohen and Charles froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas continued, &#34;Ghost swore that Cedric is the one leading Lone Wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he stopped speaking, both men just stood there,stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen took a moment, then whispered, &#34;That- can&#39;t be. How is something like that even possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles added, &#34;But Cedric&#39;s supposed to be  crippled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas finally seemed to realize something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered, &#34;Even with his leg like that,Cedric still managed to defeat Ghost. Imagine what he&#39;d be capable of if he were completely fine. Would he really struggle to get rid of any one ofus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio went quiet. No one said a thing. They exchanged glances in silence. And behind their eyes,the intent was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your call, Nikolas!&#34; said Charles and Kohen at the same time. &#34;Tell us what to do-we&#39;ll follow your lead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his fists. &#34;Only those who are removed from the equation can&#39;t challenge us.Cedric cares a lot about his leg. Let&#39;s help him-make sure it never recovers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were plenty of ways to finish someone off. And they had time to go one step at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen followed them back inside. In the living room, Daniela was reading through reports. When Charles came in with Kohen, he called out,&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned. &#34;Is the whole McCoy family moving into my house now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stepped forward, smiling. &#34;You&#39;ve misunderstood, Daniela. We&#39;re grateful Cedric chose not to compete for the inheritance. This is Charles McCoy, a brother of mine. He really appreciates Cedric&#39;s decision. He knows Cedric&#39;s leg hasn&#39;t healed. He works in medicine and has access to some of the best doctors. He wants to take Cedric for an evaluation, see if anything can be done to help him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to Charles and asked, &#34;Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded. &#34;Yes. No matter what happens,we&#39;re still family. We&#39;re concerned about his health.It&#39;s a small thing for me, but we hope it helps us all grow a little closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer sounded perfect. Daniela looked away. &#34;He&#39;s in the garden, tending the flowers.You&#39;ll find him there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them headed toward the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before they stepped out, Daniela&#39;s voice rang from the living room-cold and sharp. &#34;If you&#39;re thinking of anything else, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them stiffened, forcing uneasy smiles.&#34;Of course not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued walking to the garden.</p>
