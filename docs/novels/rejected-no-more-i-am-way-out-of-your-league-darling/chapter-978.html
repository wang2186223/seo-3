                <p>As soon as he heard the question, Cedric shifted his gaze toward Hamilton and rolled his eyes without holding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton picked up on it right away. There was something loaded in that glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hope rose in him. For a second, he imagined Cedric might square his shoulders and say with conviction, &#34;I&#39;ll handle this myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, the son Hamilton always praised as exceptional,simply stretchedout his legs, and replied,&#34;You might have gotten the wrong idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued, &#34;Daniela calls the shots on everything. Only when she doesn&#39;t want to take charge, I&#39;ll step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were tough to hear. Even so,Hamilton studied Cedric&#39;s face and saw no trace of shame.Cedric didn&#39;t seem the least bit bothered. He looked like he meant every word A wave of irritation bubbled up in Hamilton&#39;s chest.&#34;You&#39;re a man, Cedric! Don&#39;t you feeI any pride in being a McCoy? This attitude of yours... I don&#39;t know where it comes from. It sure didn&#39;t come from your mother. She wasn&#39;t a pathetic, lovesick fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden light streamed in from the window as Cedric kneaded dough. It gave him the look of someone basking in his own peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his tone light. &#34;There&#39;s no rule that says men should make all the calls. The one who&#39;s right should lead. And just so you know, my mother never got married. I&#39;d say she was a lovesick fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense!&#34; said Hamilton, sounding both flustered and annoyed. &#34;I went to see her later on,and she didn&#39;t even look me in the eye. She told me flat-out she would lost interest after being intimate with a man and she wouldn&#39;t see him again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped kneading. Slowly, he turned his head and looked at Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s ears had gone bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes. &#34;Funny. I remember you telling me you never went back to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a dramatic sigh. &#34;I said that because I was embarrassed. Truth is, I went five times. Five!And the last time, she gave me a look so cold I still feel it. So you&#39;re not like her at all. She treated me like trash after she got what she wanted. Back in those days, she was a top model. Everyone wanted her.She didn&#39;t need a man like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent years pretending none of it happened,telling people he never chased after Cedric&#39;s mother -all to protect his bruised pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trúth was, he had been left behind and didn&#39;t have the guts to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Hamilton,saw the red flush creeping up his face, and knew right away it wasn&#39;t a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if that&#39;s true, maybe we&#39;re not even related.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;That&#39;s nonsense! I&#39;ve conducted a paternity test. You&#39;re definitely my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t look thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling as if someone had punched him in the gut,Hamilton cried out, &#34;Why don&#39;t you take a look in the mirror and see what you look like right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric Let out a half-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave himn a mournful look. &#34;Is it satisfying to know your mother dumped me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric wasn&#39;t feelingtriumphant. He had entered the orphanage when he was young, and whatever memories he had of his mother were faint-mostly of her wearing flashy clothes, doing her hair just right,and carrying a different purse every time. That was about all he remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he figured it would&#39;ve been better if Hamilton hadn&#39;t let her down so badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric never looked for affection from family anyway.To him, Daniela wasn&#39;t just someone he cared for-she was everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she stayed, he had no complaints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget the past. Can you handle things where Daniela&#39;s involved?&#34; Hamilton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer made Hamilton throw up his hands.&#34;D。you even realize how serious this is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While brushing a coat of honey on the pastries, Cedric replied, &#34;She knows what she&#39;s doing. If she believes it&#39;s right, I&#39;m behind her. She always sees things through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid the tray into the oven and leaned back, eyes cast down. &#34;I worked hard just to stay by her side. You wouldn&#39;t want me ending up alone like you,would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one hit Hamilton hard.Cedric added, &#34;She may look easygoing, but when things go south, she won&#39;t hesitate to cut me loose.If that happens, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d even know how to get back on my feet. So, please, drop this. Don&#39;t bring it up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled open the kitchen door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing outside were Brad and Ethan. Cedric had no clue how long they&#39;d been listening. But he didn&#39;t care.He walked past them without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad blinked in surprise. &#34;Cedric says whatever&#39;s on his mind. Doesn&#39;t even bother with saving face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan scoffed, &#34;Who needs pride when your wife&#39;s got power and you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about? If I were in his shoes, I wouldn&#39;t care either. In families like ours, people fight like dogs over scraps. But Daniela? She just points and takes what she wants.Heard her tell Carol she&#39;s planning to hand the whole McCoy Group to Cedric. All these years we broke our backs, and it&#39;s all just a gift-wrapped toy for someone else.&#34;</p>
