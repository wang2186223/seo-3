                <p>Daniela and Cedric stepped into the hospital room and found Josh hunched over the table, scribbling intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on the document before him-the title glared back in a thick, dark letter: &#34;Confession.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela accepted the chair Cedric had quietly placed behind her and sat, hands folded, her attention fixed on the man who had taken her mother&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence draped over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh kept writing, his pen scratching across the page,until finally he set it down and slid the paper across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, this is a full account of everything that happened. If you have questions, ask me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s blunt honesty caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even he acknowledged there was no point in scheming-Daniela saw through everything anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, it was easier just to lay his cards on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back, arms folded, her lashes dropping low over her eyes. The sunlight traced faint shadows across her features, highlighting a beauty that felt untouchable,almost cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke evenly. &#34;All right, let&#39;s hear the terms you&#39;ve got in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh didn&#39;t hesitate, meeting her gaze head-on. &#34;It&#39;s.simple. I want Brad gone. You take care of him for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He searched her face, frustrated by how unreadable she was. With no hint of approval or refusal from Daniela, he went on, &#34;And another thing-I want money. Not just a little. I want every cent McCoy Group made while it was running. By my count,that&#39;s eight hundred billion. Don&#39;t try to act broke.I know you&#39;re sitting on a mountain of cash. Hand over the eight hundred billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft, incredulous laugh. She leaned back in her chair, draping one arm casually over the armrest. &#34;Is there anything else you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nodded, his chin lifted with practiced arrogance.&#34;Of course! You think I&#39;d just hand over this confession easily? Daniela, you&#39;re going to liquidate my assets-and not just that. You&#39;ll help me get out of this country for good. I want a ticket to Elite Lux,and you&#39;ll hand over half the shares to me. I&#39;m used to living well. I won&#39;t settle for misery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laugh was light and unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh pressed on, his voice smooth and coaxing. &#34;You and I both know this is nothing for you. You could have it done in minutes.&#34; He shoved the confession across the table, eyes glittering. &#34;Give me what I want,and I&#39;ll sign it. Then we&#39;re even.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the last word left his mouth, a violent storm burst to life outside. Thunder cracked, shaking the windows, and a jagged bolt of lightning threw harsh light across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overhead bulbs sputtered and, with a sharp pop,the entire room plunged into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh jolted upright, nearly springing off the bed in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed put, her lips barely curving into an amused, enigmatic smile as she observed his fluster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed by his own skittishness, Josh fumbled for composure and forced himself to recline again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? What&#39;s your answer? When do you plan to take care of all this? I&#39;ll hand over the signed confession once everything&#39;s finished.&#34; He pressed further,forcing a veneer of confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing him a glance, Daniela&#39;s gaze drifted toward the window. Her voice came out cool and distant, slicing through the tension. &#34;It&#39;s raining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stared at her, bewildered. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, icy smile flickered across Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s time for me to head home.&#34; Tension rippled through Josh&#39;s frame. &#34;But we&#39;re not done negotiating yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh escaped Daniela. &#34;Aren&#39;t we? I thought everything that needed saying was said. And, just so you know, the deal&#39;s off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s expression went rigid, panic flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want my confession?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. But...&#34; Daniela tapped the paper resting on the table,her tone suddenly piercing. &#34;This is not enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky outside had turned a deep, menacing gray.Josh recoiled, unsettled by the glint in Daniela&#39;s eyes -a cold, spectral malice that seemed to drain the warmth from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I want is...&#34; Daniela&#39;s finger arced forward,hovering just inches from Josh&#39;s face.A soft,wicked laugh escaped her lips, lingering in the air. &#34;Your life.That&#39;s the only confession I&#39;ll ever accept from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Daniela slowly made her exit,leaving the room behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lingered in the doorway, fixing Josh with a steady,unblinking stare. &#34;Did you honestly believe a simple confession would be enough to save you?That&#39;s wishful thinking. Eat well while you still can-soon, you won&#39;t get to choose what&#39;s on your plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric spun on his heel and strode out. Josh sat rigid at the bed&#39;s head, his shoulders drawn tight and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunder crashed again and again, rattling. the windowpanes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gust swept through the open window, sending the paper tumbling upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fluttered through the air, twisting and turning,then Landed soundlessly in the mouth of the trash can.</p>
