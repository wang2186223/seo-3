                <p>Ghost turned away with a cold expression and glanced at Nikolas, his demeanor calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;Be honest with me. Did my father already find out Cedric&#39;s existence? Is that why you&#39;re here to protect him? Are you intentionally spreading rumors about Cedic being part of Lone Wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost handed the gun to Nikolas. &#34;If you&#39;re so capable,then do it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his teeth. &#34;Alright, I admit I was wrong.Fine.You go ahead. I want Cedric dead in five days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,he wwalked into the villa sulkily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became. So, he called Hamilton, keeping his tone casual. &#34;Hi, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton replied, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas responded, &#34;Nothing. Just checking in. Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton answered,&#34;In Hanford, on a work trip.&#34; Nikolas let out a sigh of relief. &#34;Did you bring bodyguards? Is Ghost with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton replied impatiently, &#34;No. Is there anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas responded awkwardly, &#34;That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Hamilton closed his eyes and muttered under his breath, &#34;Idiot! With that kind of intelligence, how can he possibly lead the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas felt a little relieved. He walked into the house and glanced at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat beside Daniela, watching TV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand Cedric&#39;s pathetic demeanor, thinking that Cedric cared too much about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed loudly and retreated to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over, and Cedric asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;With such an impatient fool as the heir,no wonder Hamilton is aging so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far away in Hanford, Hamilton sneezed unexpectedly. Back in his room, Nikolas received a message from Richard. &#34;Mr. McCoy, can you bring Daniela to Room 508, Luxurious Hotel, tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked down at his phone. &#34;Just wait. What&#39;s the hurry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was always by Daniela&#39;s side. How was he able to bring Daniela to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost only needed five days to deal with Cedric.Whether Daniela lived or died didn&#39;t matter to him,and there was no need to cooperate with the Bennett family anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no need to provoke Daniela just for the sake of the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had only just finished tidying himself when a message from Hamilton buzzed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, he dialed Hamilton right away, his voice tight with urgency. &#34;Mr. McCoy, didn&#39;t you promise you&#39;d bring Daniela? Everything&#39;s set here. You can&#39;t back out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, Nikolas had endured one humiliation after another, courtesy of Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Alexander questioning him, his patience snapped. &#34;Alexander, who the hell do you think you are? I&#39;ll work with you when I feel like it, and not a second sooner. Can&#39;t you manage a woman on your own? It&#39;s pathetic, always relying on someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, no stranger to power as a long-time business mogul, had a temper to match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face darkened as Nikolas&#39; words hit him like a slap.&#34;Mr. McCoy, that&#39;s not fair. Aren&#39;t you also trying to get rid of Cedric? We&#39;re supposed to be on the same side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes. &#34;Alexander, am I too nice to you? You want to work with me, but do you even know your place? I&#39;ve already figured out that you&#39;re not the one who helped Daniela with her depression. You&#39;re a fraud! A liar! If you hadn&#39;t made Daniela believe you were her savior, would she have chased you for seven years? Alexander, you&#39;re shameless! I can&#39;t stand someone like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Nikolas ended the call, his finger pressing the button with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spat out a curse, anger boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease gnawed at him. He couldn&#39;t shake the question of why Nikolas came to Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could feel was the distance between him and Daniela growing with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety clawed at him, consuming his every thought. Clutching the Elite Lux badge Nikolas had handed him,Alexander made his way upstairs with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Daniela kept Cedric close by. When she saw Alexander appear, a flicker of surprise crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you make it up here?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced at Cedric, sitting nearby, his frustration simmering. &#34;Daniela, we need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that precise moment, Nikolas pushed the door open, just in time to catch Alexander&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding a corner, he settled in to watch the drama unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela crossed her arms, her posture relaxed as she leaned back in her chair. &#34;Alexander, if you&#39;ve got something to say,say it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela&#39;s glowving face,his voice earnest. &#34;I need to speak with you alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle, but it was laced with contempt. &#34;With your face as it is now, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned by the sharpness of Daniela&#39;s words. &#34;Honestly, is this really the best you can do with your Face?&#34; Daniela continued, her voice tinged with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gasped. Daniela had mastered the art of piercing Alexander&#39;s pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked at Daniela with longing. &#34;Daniela,please give me some time. The plastic surgeon said |can return to my old self in ten years.Please wait for me.&#34;</p>
