                <p>Richard&#39;s face looked worried against the cold,gray sky. He had become the target of too much ridicule recently and was desperately hoping Alexander would find a way to reconnect with Daniela, believing she could save Bennett Group. &#34;Of course. She helped you just like she helped Cedric. You were the one she truly trusted with her heart. This is your only shot at breaking free from Joyce. Go ahead. The future of the Bennett family depends on you now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard drove Alexander to the hospital where Cedric was being treated. &#34;Take the step, Alexander. You&#39;ll find happiness. This time,you have your father&#39;s full backing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a solemn nod before walking into the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Erika narrowed her eyes and muttered to Joyce beside her, &#34;Alexander is so greedy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce just smiled coldly, unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erika glanced at her, her voice filled with concern.&#34;Aren&#39;t you worried? What if Alexander actually ends up with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter rang out,loud and unapologetic. Erika&#39;s expression was a mix of confusion and curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce laughed until her sides ached. &#34;Do you really understand Daniela? She can have any man she wants.Why would she want someone like Alexander? Trust me, she could have anyone, but Alexander will never be one of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander never had the chance to find out if Daniela would feel pity for his current sorry state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even enter, he was stopped by the bodyguards from Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They recognized him right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Alexander stumbled out, battered and broken. His nose and mouth were twisted, one leg clearly injured, and blood streaked his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing under the dark night sky, he cut a figure both pathetic and absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood in front of him, towering like a queen,her sneer sharp as a blade. &#34;As long as you are Alexander,Daniela will never look your way again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to keep himself upright with his hands,Alexander lifted his gaze to Joyce. &#34;What exactly do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips curled into a cruel smile. &#34;I told you, in the  end, Daniela could be yours-but not if you are Alexander. Do you get it? Because as long as you are Alexander, she&#39;ll never forget those ten years when you treated her as if she didn&#39;t matter. She&#39;ll remember your indifference, your disregard, your scorn, and most of all,how you ignored her during the fire.Remaining Alexander means you&#39;ll never have any hope of winning her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion crossed his face. Blood dripped from his mouth, but he didn&#39;t flinch. His voice was desperate as he asked, &#34;But I am Alexander. How could I stop being Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile turned even more sinister. &#34;I have a solution, but it comes at a price. Are you ready to endure the cost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was lost, unable to comprehend her words,but his only focus was on one thing-finding a way to win Daniela&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it! Just tell me how!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce took in his battered form, her smile growing colder and more calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly arranged for a helicopter to whisk Alexander away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The helicopter cut through the sky, leaving a long trail in its wake. Erika, confused, asked, &#34;Where are you taking him?What do you mean he can&#39;t be Alexander anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smirked as she watched the helicopter disappear into the distance. Letting out a soft chuckle,she remarked, &#34;In this world, if you have enough money and the determination to go all in, turning into a different person is surprisingly easy. I never expected Alexander to be willing to pay such a heavy price for Daniela.&#34;</p>
