            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>After a few moments of awkward silence, Hamilton finally blurted, &#34;You couldn&#39;t even run a business right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stood there, speechless. Hamilton, for all his bluster, still fell short when it came to facing Josh head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan couldn&#39;t hidehis surprise-he&#39;d have gladly handed the floor to Daniela if he&#39;d known things would go this way. Hamilton was nothing short of a ridiculous fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a low, genuine laugh, clearly amused by Hamilton&#39;s lack of backbone.He&#39;d always known why Hamilton could never stand up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in their grandfather&#39;s day, their own father was the eldest son but never earned the family&#39;s approval.The real star had been his younger brother, the second son-outshining everyone and fueling a bitter resentment that simmered for decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironically, history repeated itself. Their father, despite having five kids, found his own second son, Hamilton,outshining the eldest when it came to talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to let go of old grudges, their father dumped his pent-up frustrations from the past onto Hamilton, stifling him at every turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton grew up without so much as a word of praise,each slight pushing him further away until he finally left home and crossed paths with Cedric&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of Hamilton, Josh carried himself with the calm authority of an older brother. So watching Hamilton shrink back now, Josh wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you find out for yourself if I&#39;m cut out to run a business? Frankly, I don&#39;t have time to stand around and gossip. I&#39;m leaving.&#34; With that,Josh turned to go, making it clear he wouldn&#39;t waste another second on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; Ethan blurted, refusing to let Josh slip away.There was far too much money at stake to back down now. &#34;Josh, I&#39;ve always respected you. I really hope you&#39;ll pay back what you owe me. No matter what,you&#39;ll always be my brother. I&#39;d hate for money to get in the way of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let go of the last shred of hope that Josh might do the right thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Daniela leaned on her hand, her eyes wide with interest, quietly watching the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you how it iis,′′Josh growled, his voice rising with irritation. &#34;The money&#39;s all tied up in investments. I can&#39;t just pull it out. If you&#39;re really desperate, I can scrape together three million,but that&#39;s it. Make your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s lips tightened with resentment. He looked away,shoulders slumped,his wounded pride visible as he flicked a helpless glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s nerves were raw, his composure unraveling in front of his daughter-in-law. He&#39;d strutted around earlier,insisting he had everything under control.How could he admit defeat now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of groveling for help made his chest tighten with humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he caved, what shred of authority would he have left as Daniela&#39;s father-in-law?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice shot up, edged with panic. &#34;Cut the nonsense! Ethan already said he&#39;s out. Give back everything he gave you, or prepare for the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s lips curled with dry amusement, his patience long gone. &#34;Oh? You&#39;re threatening me now? This I have to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the distance in a single stride, radiating a challenge that left no room for retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, Brad, and Ethan shrank back, as if the floor might swallow them whole. Josh scoffed, &#34;Go on, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got. You want to drag this out with me? I&#39;m dying to see how you plan to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drilled into Hamilton. &#34;You remember what Dad used to say, don&#39;t you? Back when he was still alive, he told you to listen to your big brother and keep your head down. Is that all thrown aside now that he&#39;s gone? You finally can&#39;t hold yourself back anymore,huh? You think you&#39;re ready to challenge me?&#34;He thrust his finger toward his cheek. &#34;Go on-hit me.I dare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the gap in a few quick strides, his presence overwhelming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three McCoy brothers kept stumbling backward until their spines pressed flat against the wall, their faces drawn and helpless, all bravado wiped clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her seat, Daniela reclined, watching the pitiful scene unfold. Every silent glance the brothers shot her way screamed for rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a mocking snort. &#34;What are you gawking at? Thought you were bold enough to challenge me.Go ahead-take your shot. Let&#39;s see which one of you has the guts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a sharp slap split the air, ringing out with authority. All three brothers jerked their heads up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her eyes, still impassive, her expression unreadable. With fierce confidence, she declared, &#34;I have.&#34;</p>
