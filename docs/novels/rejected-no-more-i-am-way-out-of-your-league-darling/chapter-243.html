                <p>A subtle smile played on Cedric&#39;s lips, but he remained silent. In the cinema&#39;s darkness, his gaze met Daniela&#39;s intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the credits rolled, Daniela was still captivated by Cedric&#39;s deep, meaningful look, which seemed to convey words he hadn&#39;t spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela heart thudded wildly in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the ride home, Daniela remained silent until they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then turned to her with a grin. &#34;Your heart&#39;s pounding, honey. We might let our little secret slip if it continues like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a helpless glance at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, bending slightly to meet Daniela&#39;s wide-eyed stare. Moments later, their heartbeats resounded together,filling the quiet night like distant drums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, my heart matches yours,&#34; Cedric joked. &#34;No one will suspect a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed both had momentarily lost their composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching the house, Daniela chose not to enter immediately with Cedric. She walked around outside to calm herself before she opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked up as she entered. &#34;Hey, Daniela, why are you alone? Cedric just headed to his room. Didn&#39;t you both return together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we came back separately,&#34; Daniela replied as she closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned in and whispered to Daniela, &#34;Cedric seemed different today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked away. &#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned closer, lowering her voice so Katrina, who might be eavesdropping, couldn&#39;t hear. &#34;Cedric was in an unusually good mood today. He walked to his room with something in his arms, trying to keep it hidden. When I asked him about it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed her gaze on Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian imitated Cedric&#39;s cheerful demeanor.&#34;He just grinned and told me it wasn&#39;t my business.Something special must&#39;ve happened today; l&#39;ve never seen him so joyful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could respond, Cedric&#39;s door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian, don&#39;t disturb Daniela. She didn&#39;t sleep well last night and is quite exhausted. Let her rest.&#34; He then turned his attention to Daniela, his tone softening. &#34;I need to discuss a project with you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric retreated and closed his door, Lillian stared at his door in disbelief. &#34;Did you catch that? His smile wasn&#39;t just happy; his eyes sparkled with excitement too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to respond, Lillian, still puzzled, spoke up. &#34;And what exactly does Cedric mean? I spoke to you, and he claimed | was disturbing your rest, but wasn&#39;t he bothering you as well by wanting to discuss a project? What is he trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was taken aback by Lillian&#39;s sharp observation. She smiled and ascended the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Daniela&#39;s departure, Lillian leaned towards Ryan and whispered, &#34;Doesn&#39;t Daniela seem off today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, absorbed in his computer, casually dismissed her concern. &#34;She&#39;s as calm and collected as she&#39;s always been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced skeptically between Cedric&#39;s door and the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dining room, Katrina had been observing theexchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela saw Lillian frown, a mischievous thought crossed her mind.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly set her food aside and walked over,leaning in to whisper to Lillian, &#34;Did Daniela and Cedric have a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave her a sharp, cold glance. &#34;They&#39;re perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Katrina smirked. &#34;They usually return together, yet Cedric arrived earlier today alone. Also,he didn&#39;t inquire about Daniela immediately, which is unusual for him. He just headed straight to his room,seemingly indifferent about whether Daniela was here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina settled beside Lillian. &#34;So, they must have argued, right? I&#39;ve always thought Daniela too distant for Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly said, irritated, &#34;And why isn&#39;t Daniela right for him? Do you think someone else would be better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes sparkled with mischief. &#34;Absolutely!My niece, Shirley Randall, is gorgeous, tall, leggy and buxom, which certainly appeals to men. Cedric and Daniela are both too reserved. Honestly, I think bringing Shirley here could spark something with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a thrill at the thought of conflict between Cedric and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian could reply, Katrina strode out to the yard to make a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was a bit too loud, reaching Daniela&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her shower, Daniela preferred not to blow-dry her hair. With a towel in hand, she stood on the balcony, and by chance, overheard Katrina making a phone call below.</p>
