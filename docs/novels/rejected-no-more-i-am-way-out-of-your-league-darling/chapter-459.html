                <p>Natalie stared at Daniela, her eyes brimming with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cupped her chin with one hand,her expression indifferent. &#34;Really? I actually like the bad boy type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie groaned,exasperated. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re not exactly the hopeless romantic type. Money matters,you know.How does Cedric have such a hold on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize it before, but I guess I am a romantic after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sighed, feeling utterly defeated as Daniela&#39;s proud expression lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She departed Daniela&#39;s office, only to be stopped at the door. A hand extended a sleek black card towards her.&#34;Five million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned, her eyes narrowing at the ugly face before her. &#34;Spend a night with me, and it&#39;s all yours.Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed, her chin lifting defiantly. &#34;What a joke!Linden,do you think I&#39;d sell my dignity for five million?Pathetic.&#34; Linden watched Natalie retreat with cold amusement She carried herself with pride.Yet, he found himself drawn to that pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought it would be fascinating to watch her submit someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark, twisted smile crept across Linden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie never thought she&#39;d lose sleep over five million,let alone borrow from friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all avoided the topic, leaving Natalie seething with frustration. In the end, none of them could be counted on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, we&#39;re strapped too. Our allowances barely cover us. But there&#39;s a way to make quick money.Are you interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shot her friend a skeptical glance. &#34;What way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attending those exclusive parties hosted by the wealthy, and staying for three days and nights.A hundred thousand dollars a night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sneered. &#34;So, basically, selling yourself.Those men are vile. They&#39;ll chew you up and spit yo out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie carried herself with a sense of superiority,believing virtue was priceless. Men like that could only dream of touching her. If they thought they could get anywhere near her, they&#39;d better start dreaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You highly regard yourself, but do you want the money?&#34; her friend snapped. &#34;If you&#39;re willing to go I&#39;ll make sure they offer you more money. Natalie,with your looks, you&#39;d make double. It&#39;s a waste not to put it to use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie spat, her voice icy. &#34;I&#39;m not lowering my standards entertaining men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Born into high society, she had seen it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to stoop to those decadent gatherings where the rich reveled in their indulgence and depravity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie strode off, her face set in determination, while Ker friend watched her retreating form with a bitter,almost contemptuous sneer. &#34;You&#39;ll be crawling back eventually,&#34;she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation led Natalie to see Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood before him, head bowed,biting her lip.&#34;Cedric, I&#39;m in trouble. I need to borrow some money.Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stationed herself at the entrance of the Elite Lux building, blocking Cedric&#39;s way. Dressed in a daring,low-cut evening gown with a thigh-high slit, she exuded an air of allure and seduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had to cross this line, it had to be someone as striking as Cedric, not some pot-bellied, balding man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She convinced herself that sleeping with Cedric felt  like a huge win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, his face twisted with a look of repulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, I&#39;m untouched. You could be my first.Teach and guide me in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face held a delicate, innocent allure that effortlessly drew attention. She knew exactly when she appeared at her most captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face remained stone-cold as he gestured to a security guard, who had been staring in shock,and signaled him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Mr.Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throw this woman out. Make sure she never steps foot in Elite Lux again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face drained of color as shock washed over her.&#34;Cedric,I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, the security guard roughly seized Natalie and dragged her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door of Elite Lux slammed shut behind her and Natalie couldn&#39;t believe her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t at all how she had imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the darkness, Linden asked, &#34;Now that Natalie&#39;s been thrown out of Elite Lux, are you really still not going to help me?&#34; Elyse stared across the road at Natalie, her makeup smudged by tears. &#34;Why would I trust you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden smiled, his expression calm. &#34;Because I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s family doctor and she trusts me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes narrowed, a shadow passing over her expression. Maybe Daniela suspected her connection to Brylee&#39;s death.Why else would she refuse to help Natalie with the money she required?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela knew the truth, Elyse knew she would have to have Daniela killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One night,&#34; Linden said, his tongue flicking over his lips. &#34;As long as Natalie willingly spends one night with me,I&#39;ll kill Daniela for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse hesitated, then nodded. &#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden smiled, glancing at Elyse. &#34;Do you think Natalie will obey your request? Oh, let me clarify something.Don&#39;t pull any tricks with masks. I want to confirm it&#39;s really her this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s plan was exposed, and her fury simmered.&#34;What are you implying? Did I trick you before? Isn&#39;t Nina my daughter? Didn&#39;t she sleep with you? Linden,you&#39;ve gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden chuckled darkly. &#34;Killing Daniela&#39;s too risky.I honestly miss the first time. How about you let me have both girls?&#34; But Linden wasn&#39;t done. His grin widened,dripping with mockery as he stared at Elyse. &#34;Or you could join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Elyse&#39;s calm demeanor. Linden let out a hearty laugh. &#34;Alright then, how about this? I still prefer Natalie. If you don&#39;t trust me, how about you and Nina serve me for a night first? Once that&#39;s done, then let Natalie sleep with me. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden grinned wickedly. &#34;I like saving the best for last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s stomach churned with utter disgust.</p>
