                <p>Katrina was worried Daniela might decline. Her voice grew louder. &#34;It&#39;s merely a director position, Daniela!You&#39;re now the CEO of Elite Lux, powerful and established. Are you truly reluctant to bestow such a minor role upon your own sister? Or could it be that you&#39;re worried Joyce might eclipse you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips twisted into a subtle smirk, her poise undisturbed. &#34;Worried? Hardly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes sparkled with unexpected hope. Lately, she had become accustomed to encountering nothing but roadblocks and hadn&#39;t anticipated Daniela&#39;s apparent willingness to cooperate, especially in the presence of the press.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside Daniela, her secretary&#39;s brow furrowed, her gaze shifting between her boss and the eager journalists, poised to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela continued, &#34;A director position? It&#39;s hardly a big deal. I&#39;ve only just come back to the country, and while I&#39;m still laying my groundwork here, if my family insists on putting someone in the company, I&#39;ll graciously accept. After all, whether they share my blood or not, how could I possibly refuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words hung in the air, Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened on her lips. The underlying sarcasm lacing Daniela&#39;s remarks did not go unnoticed, piercing her with its intended sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her poised and gracious air intact, Daniela carried on. &#34;Elite Lux has been a bastion of meritocracy from the start-that&#39;s well understood. But now, my stepmother wants to dismantle years of our foundational values with her shallow speeches. Often, they talk about the challenges of being a stepmother,yet they seldom mention the trials of being a stepdaughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Katrina&#39;s complexion grew noticeably lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention to Joyce with a slight tilt of her head, indicating genuine curiosity, Daniela asked,&#34;Joyce, could you share your educational background with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation,Joyce replied, &#34;I left school before finishing high school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded her with a reflective expression, her voice tinged with courteous sarcasm. &#34;A high school dropout,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lightly tapped her chin, pretending to mull over the information. &#34;That indeed suggests a unique set of skills. I&#39;ll have to consider carefully how we might utilize your talents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a look of revelation crossed her face as she turned her eyes towards Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; she called out with exaggerated sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overly affectionate term caused Caiden to tense visibly. &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Harper Group possibly make room for Joyce? She is your daughter, cherished deeply. Surely,elevating her to the role of president wouldn&#39;t be too difficult, would it? In fact, placing her merely as a director in my company might not even do justice to her remarkablecapabilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words had barely finished resonating when soft laughter began to fill the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, she caught Cedric trying to suppress his amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mock sternness, Daniela admonished him.. Phillips, I&#39;d appreciate it if you could keep up that dignified demeanor of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrugged with a sly grin. &#34;Alright, I wwill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unusual rapport between them caught everyone off guard.Yet, Daniela was not one to let the moment slide without comment. She turned to Caiden and remarked in a humble tone, &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve always known I&#39;m not the brightest-certainly not enough to gain your approval. Yesterday, you were so upset that you struck me. Truth be told, I was as restless as you were last night. After much reflection, I&#39;ve realized something crucial:with my modest abilities, I&#39;m simply not suited to take over Harper Group. So please, don&#39;t burden yourself with thoughts of having another child with my stepmother. Just give the reins to Joyce. She truly is your pride and joy. As for me, I&#39;ll bow out gracefully. I have no intention of vying for the family&#39;s legacy any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters marveled at her generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her head slightly, exhaling a deep sigh. &#34;That slap really put things into perspective for me.I wouldn&#39;t dream of contending for anything anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her declaration ignited a surge of outrage among the reporters. The crowd was outraged. What twisted father would drive his daughter to turn her back on her birthright?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden and Katrina stood there, their shock was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face twisted into a scowl as he shot back, &#34;No way! Joyce can&#39;t possibly run Harper Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;Dad, aren&#39;t you a bit old to cling to power? It&#39;s somewhat unbecoming, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck hard, and all eyes darted towards Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Joyce joined in, her voice tinged with a hopeful whine. &#34;Come on, Dad, give me another shot at the company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a moment of frustration, Caiden sharply tugged his hand away from Joyce&#39;s grip. His patience fractured like brittle glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fury in his voice, he bellowed, &#34;How dare you even suggest that? I entrusted you with the finance department, and you squandered over a million! When I moved you to marketing, you drove away a key client-one we&#39;ve maintained for more than a decade! And in public relations, you ended up entangled with some junior intern! What more can I possibly trust you with? Each moment you spend at Harper Group only hastens our downfall!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was all too familiar with what had transpired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, ever the strategist, had long been persuading Caiden to allow Joyce to&#34;ather experience&#34;at the company, secretly dreading that Harper Group might someday fall into Daniela&#39;s more capable hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the outcome? In less than a week, Joyce had cost the company over ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the incident, Caiden had been steeped in unease. He found it impossible to include Joyce in any client interactions at the company. During one unfortunate meeting, she inadvertently caused a staggering loss of over five million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a dinner gathering, she mistakenly addressed Mr. Bradley as &#34;Mr. Chavez,&#34; and thenconfused the real Mr. Chavez with their competitor, Mr. Norris. That epic fail spread like wildfire in Olisvine, making them the butt of every joke for an entire year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, Caiden felt compelled to confine Joyce at home, pampering her like a cherished but sheltered princess, safely away from the business&#39;s operations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tale was that the client involved in that fateful meeting still harbored resentment. Despite Caiden&#39;s efforts to mend fences by sending several cases of exquisite wine, the relationship remained strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Katrina, this mess was the kind of shame that refused to die, always gnawing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, following a flopped deal to secure a new shop location, Katrina decided to make her daughter a director in Daniela&#39;s company. And Caiden was more than willing to cooperate. After all, they clearly thought Daniela was stupid enough to accept Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unruffled, casually dropping a remark before receding into the background, her eyes observing the ensuing tumult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce latched onto Caiden&#39;s armn, her voice laced with sharp impatience. &#34;Dad! Did you hear that? Daniela just renounced her claimto Harper Group! It should be mine now! You won&#39;t be around forever,you know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Katrina, usually so composed, was caught off guard by the bluntness of the statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters leaped into action, their pens dancing across notepads, cameras capturing every moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded and overwhelmed, Caiden struggled to navigate the relentless flood of inquiries. Joyce continued to cling to his arm, her pleas tinged with desperation. Katrina, gripped by fear that Daniela might reconsider her decision and stake a claim, added her voice to the growing clamor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela had retreated to the fringes of the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood apart, her expression cool and distant, silently observing the spectacle unfold.</p>
