                <p>Elyse stepped away to use the restroom, where she quickly sent a message to the doctor who was courting Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Linden, once Cedric Phillips is gone,I&#39;ll be with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came almost instantly, as if he had been waiting for her to reach out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly typed back, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden responded, &#34;It&#39;s a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then added, &#34;Natalie, I&#39;ll take care of this as soon as possible, and then you&#39;ll be mine. I can&#39;t wait to start a perfect life with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving,Elyse erased the messages and added Linden under a new account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To avoid any problems later, use this backup account to get in touch with me from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered quickly, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Liden messaged, &#34;Can I get a little reward for this? After all, I&#39;m doing something risky for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse felt a wave of disgust but still took a provocative photo of her leg and sent it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eager response came almost instantly. &#34;That&#39;s stunning. I can&#39;t wait for all the days we&#39;ll share together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of him alone made Elyse&#39;s stomach turn.She had met him before-a peculiar, disheveled man who always carried the smell of old, damp clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in order to manipulate him, Elyse forced herself to push aside her disgust and texted, &#34;Me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, he replied with an inappropriate photo of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just at that moment, Natalie stepped in and asked,&#34;Mom,have you seen my phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Elyse swiftly tucked her phone away,returned Natalie&#39;s phone to her, and, with a cool,collected air, she walked out of the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reputation in business was truly well-earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day after the press conference, Phillips Group&#39;s stock skyrocketed, surpassing its previous highs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives, who had been anxious and troubled,finally breathed sighs of relief. The entire Phillips Group not only admired and respected Daniela but now looked up to her with great reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed her lead without question. Within just five days, Phillips Group&#39;s stock soared to new heights,shutting down all doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of optimism swept through everyone in the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen in front of the TV, watching every channel mention Daniela&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had tied the knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had saved Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had not only turned the company&#39;s crisis around but also lifted it to levels of success it had never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Daniela cared for Cedric was nothing short of inspiring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard jabbed a finger at the TV, his voice sharp.&#34;Daniela saved Phillips Group. Why doesn&#39;t she save you? Does she have no heart? How can she watch you be used by Joyce and not even bat an eye? How could she be so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice sent a chill down the room. It seemed like he was teetering on the edge of losing it.Or maybe,just maybe,he had already crossed that line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word had spread all over Olisvine that Alexander was being financially backed by Joyce, and people were making fun ofhim everywhere he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once a respected figure, Richard was now treated like an outcast wherever he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feIt like a shadow, an object of shame. His pride had been buried long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, when Phillips Group&#39;s stock dropped, Richard stayed glued to the TV, secretly hoping it would collapse just like Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after days of waiting, one press conference from Daniela not only revived Phillips Group but sent it into an unbelievable rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he stand watching this happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard exploded at Alexander in fury. &#34;You must have been out of your mind to divorce Daniela! If you&#39;d stayed with her, Bennett Group would still be flourishing.You pushed away such an amazing woman.This is al your fault. Just go get her back, however you need to. Bring Daniela back into your life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched the TV, his eyes fixed on Daniela as she effortlessly took charge of the press conference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of jealousy overtook him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce called Alexander, commanding him to strip. He stayed frozen for a moment,refusing to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lay on the bed, a mocking smile on her lips.&#34;Are you still dreaming? Still imagining that Daniela will come back to you? The moment you bent to me,you lost any chance with her. Maybe she&#39;d risk everything for Cedric, but that has nothing to do with you. Don&#39;t you get it? You and Daniela are finished.You belong to me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stood up, grabbed Alexander&#39;s tie, and yanked it loose,laughingharshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they finished making love, she stretched out on the bed, her expression dripping with smug satisfaction. &#34;Daniela&#39;s probably buried in work. You need to go after her on the business front. Start by pulling some of Elite Lux&#39;s clients over to our side.Once you&#39;ve gained a solid footing, make your move to get closer to her. After that,have the hypnotist do his work on her. Doug won&#39;t wait forever,so it&#39;s time to act quickly.&#34;</p>
