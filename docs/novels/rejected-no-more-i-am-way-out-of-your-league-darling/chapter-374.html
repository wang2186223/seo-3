                <p>Nina paused outside the room, hesitating for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She worried Cedric and Ryan might either leave or drink themselves into oblivion. After all, she&#39;d heard that when men got too drunk, certain functions stopped working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a smile, she slowly eased the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, she came to an abrupt halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was still deep in conversation with Cedric. Nina shut her eyes momentarily,swallowing her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom what could keep two grown men talking for this long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much longer did Ryan plan on hanging around as the third wheel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina approached with a practiced smile, carefully refilling their glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled beside them, playing the gracious host as  day faded into night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one point, Cedric stood to adjust the heater,and Nina&#39;s eyes instinctively trailed down to the exposed skin beneath his loosened collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered for mere seconds before Cedric shifted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina tilted her head with a bashful smile. &#34;Mr. Phillips,it&#39;s truly an honor to meet you. When I learned you frequented Elite Lux, I told my mother I wanted to train under Daniela-just to have a chance to see you more often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his gaze to the window, staring at the moon. The faint fragrance Daniela often left behind still lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself missing Daniela, far more than he was willing to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been speaking for a while now, clearly fishing for a reaction from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, but he remained silent, his eyes fixed on the moon, lost in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cautiously, Nina ventured, &#34;Are you thinking about Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t easy to engage, so Nina chose to steer the conversation towards the one subject that might capture his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started recounting stories about Daniela and her childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina described how deeply connected Daniela had been with Brylee and how everything in her life unraveled after Brylee&#39;s passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned in slightly, his focus sharpening as he listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He displayed no sign of impatience, silently taking in every detail Nina divulged about Daniela&#39;s past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a child, Daniela used to laugh endlessly. Her smile was radiant. But after Brylee&#39;s death, that smile vanished and never returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes met Cedric&#39;s for a fleeting moment, and her heartbeat quickened in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It had to be some deep-seated trauma, like Daniela lost her capacity to love. Even when she was with Alexander, she chased him and did everything for him,yet she never truly let him in. Even then, we suspected she might never fully open her heart to anyone again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s tone carried a calm yet resolute certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, please don&#39;t take it personally. It&#39;s not that she dislikes you; it&#39;s that she doesn&#39;t know how to like anyone. To her, relationships feel too fragile, and  deep down, she struggles to trust anyone. That applies to anyone she might end up with, honestly.Maybe it&#39;s for the best you two aren&#39;t together.She doesn&#39;t coddle anyone, and she&#39;s not one to express her feelings. Whoever ends up with her someday will have a challenging time. My mother always says that even if Daniela marries someone, she&#39;d never fully accept them in her heart. She just doesn&#39;t let her guard down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, innocent smile, Nina added, &#34;When Alexander brought up divorce, Daniela agreed without hesitation and never looked back. When someone ever wants to know if Daniela truly loves him,he could tell her he&#39;s leaving. If she tries to stop him, then she genuinely cares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fingers tightened around his wine glass as he sat in prolonged silence. At last, he asked, &#34;So what you&#39;re saying is, if Daniela genuinely loves someone andhe tries to leave,she&#39;ll undoubtedly try to stop him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina nodded confidently. &#34;Exactly. She bottles everything up. If she ever speaks up and asks someone to stay, it means that person holds a permanent place in her heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina poured herself another glass of wine. After taking a sip, she said, &#34;But honestly, Daniela probably won&#39;t let anyone stay close to her. She&#39;s too guarded. She had loved Alexander for ten years, yet now she&#39;s cast him aside without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shrugged casually. &#34;From what I&#39;ve heard,Alexander only ended up with Joyce because Daniela rejected him. That&#39;s why he&#39;s so desperate to hold on to Joyce-he has nowhere else to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Nina stole a quick glance at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure that after hearing this, Cedric, regardless of his feelings for Daniela, would see it was time to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t Cedric the sharpest man around, famous for steering clear of unnecessary risks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together briefly, Nina said, &#34;You&#39;re an incredible man with no shortage of admirers. Why not explore a bit more? Your ideal match might already be right there,waiting for you to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were heavy with implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt confident Cedric would understand her meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head slightly, she took another sip of her wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight spilled across the floor outside, casting a radiant glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, the three of them drained bottle after  bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina carried most of the conversation, while Cedric appeared lost in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time dawn broke, Nina&#39;s head spun with dizziness. Cedric arranged for a female driver to take her home, while Ryan lay slumped over the table,completely unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes, however, remained piercing and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scanned the room quietly, taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s words echoed repeatedly in his mind. &#34;If you say you&#39;re leaving and Daniela asks you to stay, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll know she truly cares about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fingers clenched tightly around his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he rose and strode towards the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the early hour, he turned on the cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refreshed, Cedric changed into clean clothes,grabbed his keys, and headed straight to the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the engine roared to life, he drove off without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela opened her door, the first thing she spotted was Cedric&#39;s car parked outside.</p>
