                <p>That was the first time Daniela met Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At seventy, he exuded vitality, his hair full and strikingly devoid of grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only hint of his age was his reliance on a cane for stability as he exited his vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, both sharp and discerning, instantly found Daniela across the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes met and held from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of sophistication, Hamilton&#39;s face broke into a smile. Charles rushed to his side, offering support while addressing him respectfully, &#34;Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton acknowledged him with a simple grunt, his focus still intensely on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching her, Hamilton said, &#34;Daniela, to finally meet you does justice to your renowned elegance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight smile, Daniela responded courteously,&#34;Hello, Mr.McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Charles&#39; evident nervousness, Hamilton&#39;s demeanor turned stern. &#34;Still so useless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, Charles collapsed to his knees at his father&#39;s harsh words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s firm hand in family matters was unmistakably evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Charles on the floor and then back at Hamilton, Daniela noted the dynamics at play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile returned as he addressed her.&#34;Sorry, my son has made a fool of himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Hamilton&#39;s commanding aura, Daniela maintained her poise, her smile unwavering and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze toward Daniela grew more appreciative. &#34;I heard Cedric is here. I would like an introduction.&#34; Initially, there was a touch of geniality in his voice.Then, his gaze turned to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen had a large, transparent sliding door that made its interior entirely visible from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Hamilton caught sight of the son he had always pictured as a perfect elite, now grounded in a more domestic role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a neatly tailored apron, Cedric expertly handled a chef&#39;s knife, cutting a simple cucumber into slices so precise they resembled art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A profound quiet settled across the living room at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, Cedric&#39;s voice carried over.&#34;This knife traveled with me from home. I had it specifically tailored for my hand. It&#39;s wonderfully precise, and the quality of the blade is exceptional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression soured at these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, still on his knees, shut his eyes, anticipating his father&#39;s outrage. Yet, Hamilton&#39;s response was unexpectedly mild,albeit disapproving. &#34;Why would a man waste his time in the kitchen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, quick to defend Cedric&#39;s choice, responded with composed assurance, &#34;If it brings him joy, then it is worthwhile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela, his smile tightening slightly. &#34;It seems he has picked up some peculiar habits abroad. A McCoy should not merely become whatever he pleases.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her own country, Daniela might not have intervened, confident in Cedric&#39;s ability to defend himself. However, being overseas heightened her protective instincts towards Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;He&#39;s my husband. His choices require only my approval, not anyone else&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her statement, not just Charles, who remained kneeling, but also Hamilton&#39;s secretary turned to look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her delicate appearance, she displayed formidable courage. She boldly challenged Hamilton,standing firm in her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scrutinized Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;l&#39;ve been informed that you two are divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the current rumor, is it?&#34; Daniela asked.&#34;Well, until he signs the divorce agreement, it holds no weight. I&#39;m quite sure he won&#39;t sign it, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s laughter followed her assertion. &#34;You&#39;re that sure of yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded in affirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression twisted into a sardonic smile.&#34;Women cling to emotions, believing that capturing a man&#39;s heart is akin to conquering the world.Yet men aspire beyond, forever chasing more. Cedric is just like the rest. If I offer him enough wealth, he might change his mind about not divorcing you. And if he disagrees, it just means I don&#39;t offer enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile gleamed with assurance, outshining Hamilton&#39;s skepticism. &#34;We shall see, won&#39;t we?&#34; At that moment, the kitchen door slid open. Clad in a black apron and gripping his bespoke knife, Cedric called out, &#34;Beef for lunch sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect,&#34; Daniela responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked back into the kitchen, acting like he hadn&#39;t seen Charles on his knees or Hamilton standing there the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies,&#34; Daniela said, her voice devoid of any real regret. &#34;My husband isn&#39;t acquainted with any of you. In his world, I&#39;m all that matters. Should that discomfort you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was expecting Daniela to offer a compromise, perhaps suggesting, &#34;If that bothers you,I&#39;ll have him adjust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela&#39;s next words took a different turn.&#34;Then it&#39;s something you might néed to adapt to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s pleasant demeanor suddenly stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a beat, then, with a clenched jaw, he said coldly, &#34;Would it be alright if I joined you for</p>
