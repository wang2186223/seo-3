                <p>Cedric looked at Daniela and asked, &#34;But this clue matters a lot to you, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her laptop and replied, &#34;It matters to me,but not to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In some ways, she and Cedric weren&#39;t all that different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was never clear how much money was truly enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, having just enough to live on was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care for luxury. She could enjoy a high-end restaurant or eat from a stall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she really wanted was a quiet life without noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never planned to drag Cedric into the chaos she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her world was messy,unpredictable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was nothing like the easy, bright future Cedric should&#39;ve had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deserved a smooth life, one filled with comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need her to get there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could do it on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I want to be someone who matters to you,&#34; said Cedric, his voice sincere. &#34;You&#39;re my wife, Daniela.What you care about-I care about too.I don&#39;t want to feel like you&#39;re shutting me out. Can you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept typing. &#34;I see that. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric closed her laptop and added, &#34;I mean it. If it&#39;s for your sake, I&#39;ll go back to the McCoy family. Why don&#39;t you believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked him in the eye. &#34;I believe you, but that won&#39;t happen. We&#39;re two separate people. Everyone should handle their own life first, then look out for others. You&#39;ve got your priorities mixed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone stayed even, but there was weight behind her words. &#34;You need to think about yourself. This situation is dangerous. I don&#39;t want you pulled in because of me. Do you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric chose to get involved, it had to be his decision, not something he did out of obligation to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want him risking anything on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t budge on this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows pulled together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice dropped a little lower. She looked straight at him and said, &#34;Cedric, if you act on your own,I will leave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she lowered her head and kept working on her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed beside her in silence for a long time, should handle their own life first, then look out for others. You&#39;ve got your priorities mixed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone stayed even, but there was weight behind her words. &#34;You need to think about yourself. This situation is dangerous. I don&#39;t want you pulled in because of me. Do you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric chose to get involved, it had to be his decision, not something he did out of obligation to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want him risking anything on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t budge on this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows pulled together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice dropped a little lower. She looked straight at him and said, &#34;Cedric, if you act on your own,I will leave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she lowered her head and kept working on her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed beside her in silence for a long time, but she never once glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped he would take the time to think things through on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he stood up. His voice came out soft,with a trace of pain in it.&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;stayed rooted in place after saying that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after some time did he finally walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before leaving, he said quietly, &#34;You&#39;ve never seen me as someone who truly belongs in your world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept typing without pause, her focus unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol walked in from outside and glanced behind her as she changed her shoes. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s going on with Cedric? Is he upset or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t stop working. She kept scanning the data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol sat down. &#34;Did you hear me? He&#39;s outside by himself, sitting in the pavilion. I tried to talk to him,but he looked really off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;Let him sort it out on his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a nod. &#34;Bythe way,we found Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hands paused over the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s trying to get her hands on explosives.I guess she&#39;s planning to blow you up like the previous bombing incident. What do you think we should do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone stayed calm. &#34;Assign someone to monitor her. Any word on Winslow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed that Caiden, Joyce, and Natalie were just cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real danger was Winslow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew who M really was.</p>
