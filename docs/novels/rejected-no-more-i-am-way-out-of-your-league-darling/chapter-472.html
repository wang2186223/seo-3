                <p>Thirty minutes had passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric furrowed his brows, clearly annoyed. &#34;How much longer must I wait? Why doesn&#39;t Kenny just have my wife move into his tech department?&#34; Under her breath, the secretary whispered,&#34;Kenny would appreciate that, but aren&#39;t you the one who would hate it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware that Cedric was genuinely angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After forty minutes, Cedric&#39;s expression turned stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His observant secretary exclaimed with a dramatic sigh.&#34;Oh dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyebrows knitted together even tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the secretary said, &#34;Kenny is so careless. How could he leave the documents that needed signing up here? I need to take them down to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she finished speaking than the documents disappeared from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Cedric walk towards the elevator. With a smirk, the secretary followed him, saying.&#34;Mr Phillips, please excuse my honesty. As a man,you shouldn&#39;t be too proud. Your wife offered you a way out earlier, but you turned it down. Now, you&#39;re chasing after her yourself. Isn&#39;t that just asking for trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric briefly closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary struggled to hold back her laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In negotiations, Cedric was always composed,yet now he couldn&#39;t remain seated for forty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was amazing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not only a titan in the business world but also very skilled at managing her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary admired Daniela deeply once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exited the elevator quickly, adjusting his tie as he entered the tech department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the server room, Kenny was smiling at a screen filled with code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked around but didn&#39;t see Daniela anywhere</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, what brings you here?&#34; Kenny asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face showed clear annoyance. &#34;Where is Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny gestured upstairs. &#34;The finance manager  needed her. He was puzzled by a tax incentive policy and required her expertise for some financial framework design. So, he took her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression grew darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed upstairs, finding Daniela in the conference room, explaining the tax framework to the finance manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could get close, the finance manager hurried over, pleading, &#34;Mr. Phillips, please! I don&#39;t need my bonus this month. Just let me work wvith your wife for a while,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes. &#34;I married my wife to cherish her, not to let her handle your ordinary tasks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance manager looked shocked and disheartened. &#34;Mr. Phillips, what are you saying?How can you refer to the work of the finance department as just ordinary tasks? Please, let her assist me. Do l need to get on my knees?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a deep breath before pulling up a chair and sitting down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have accepted Daniela&#39;s peace offering earlier. Now, he had to wait at the door like a bystander. How irritating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the afternoon, every Phillips Group employee who walked past the finance department witnessed their CEO, dressed in a suit, sitting on a bench with his arms crossed,eyeing everyone with a cold gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary had to leave for a while to attend to some matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours went by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unable to sit still any longer, stood up and peeked into the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fantastic!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire finance department was there, focused on Daniela&#39;s presentation on her new financial model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had never felt such regret in his life. Had he known,he would have never started a company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cedric made a quick trip to the restroom, the people in the conference room changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance department had made way for the marketing department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, could you go over your spiral market competition concept once more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was packed to its full capacity with the marketing department. When the secretary returned, he found Cedric squeezed at the doorway and thoughtfully offered him a chair, whispering, &#34;Mr. Phillips, maybe we should head back to your office? It seems like this session isn&#39;t going to wrap up any time soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face was unreadable. He scoffed, &#34;Head back upstairs? If I do, the next group to come in will be the admin department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the admin manager arrived with a notebook followed by a team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, visibly irritated, pointed to a spot behind him and told the smiling admin manager, &#34;Line up over there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the crowded room, Cedric didn&#39;t feel like leaving. Eventually, someone cleared a spot for him in a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat there, his expression stern, observing Daniela as she stood at the center of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was remarkably insightful. She simplified the company&#39;s complex issues and used short stories to make her points relatable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gloomy expression, Cedric said to his secretary.&#34;Isn&#39;t Daniela just saying the same things as I said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was surprised. &#34;Mr. Phillips, your explanations are highly professional. They&#39;re enlightening once we understand them, but what your  wife shares feels like a sudden revelation for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was indeed the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was outstanding, like the luminous moon in the sky,shedding its light gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s explanations, however, were like the soft rain of spring, subtly enlightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally,everyone favored Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd appropriately told Daniela,&#34;lt would be wonderful if you worked at Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This suggestion was met with nods of agreement from everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a cold laugh from his corner, his smile chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the workday drew to an end, the group was still hesitant to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave his secretary a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary quickly understood. &#34;Everyone! It&#39;s timne to close up for today.&#34;</p>
