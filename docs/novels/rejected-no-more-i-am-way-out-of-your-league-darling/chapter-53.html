                <p>Joyce was crying uncontrollably. Katrina, unable to bear seeing her daughter like this, felt as though her heart was breaking into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without caring about her pride, she dropped to the floor,her body trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing her head back, she let out a loud, heart-wrenching wail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden, after all these years of marriage, do you have any idea how many people have laughed at me behind my back? How many have pointed fingers and whispered about me? I put up with all of it-because l love you! I loved you so deeply that I endured the pain. You have no idea how proud I once was. But for you, I surrendered it all-my pride, my dignity, my sense of self-worth. You said that if I married you,you would take care of everything outside the home,while I would be in charge of everything inside. And I trusted you. Throughout the years, I&#39;ve treated Daniela like my own daughter. I gave her more love and attention than I ever gave Joyce! Tell me,how many stepmothers would sacrifice so much for their stepchild? When I decided to marry you, everyone told me it would bring nothing but trouble, that being a stepmother would be nothing but heartache. But l turned a deaf ear to them, all because I love you. And what about Joyce? Hasn&#39;t she treated you well? From the moment she became part of this family, she called you &#39;Dad.! She&#39;s always been respectful and kind to you, year after year! And Daniela? Has she ever called me &#39;Mom&#39; even once? Not a single time!I let it slide, convincing myself it wasn&#39;t important. But today,Daniela crossed the line! She humiliated both Joyce and me in front of everyone. I&#39;m too old to endure this kind of shame. I feel like I might as well just disappear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head back dramatically, as though she intended to smash it against the vase she was holding in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she could act, she shot a meaningful glance at Joyce. Without hesitation, Joyce flung herself against a nearby pillar, wailing dramatically. &#34;I might as well die too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, visibly shaken by the drama, stormed out in frustration. He grabbed a phone from a passerby, his mind racing with anger. Once the call connected, his voice thundered through the receiver. &#34;Daniela! If you want to avoid your father dropping dead in your posh building today, you better get down here now! You&#39;ve got five minutes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela had just put pen to paper on a long-term deal for an incredibly lucrative contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mood was cool and composed, unaffected by the chaos unfolding below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she opened the message she had sent to Caiden the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to head downstairs, Cedric arrived at her office. She asked him to wait a little while inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her secretary, arriving late, carelessly mentioned something about Katrina and Caiden being downstairs. Without wasting a second,Cedric turned and quickly took another elevator, heading straight for the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, ever close behind, followed Daniela every step of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator descended, the chaotic scene in the basement came into view. Katrina was seated on the floor, crying uncontrollably, while Joyce clung to a pillar, her sobs just as theatrical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood nearby, hands firmly on his hips, his head lowered as though he were fighting to keep his fury in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp click of Daniela&#39;s heels on the floor immediately caught Caiden&#39;s attention. His gaze shot up, his cold, furious eyes locking onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That face-so eerily similar to the one that had tormented him for years. The face of the woman who had once made him feel insignificant and weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest swelled with rage. Without a second thought, he stormed towards her and slapped her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the entire basement, bouncing off the cold walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chatter of shopkeepers, the footsteps of passersby, and the hum of the crowd all vanished as people froze, their attention now drawn to the sudden noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood rooted to the spot, her eyes wide with shock, unable to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, stepping out of the elevator just as the slap echoed, felt a tightness in his chest. Without thinking, he sprang into action and rushed towards the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the heavy silence that followed, one person remained composed. It was Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood firm, her eyes steady and unwavering.Her hands had initially balled into fists, but she slowly relaxed them, choosing calm over reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of hurried footsteps echoed behind her,and before Daniela could fully grasp the situation,she was enveloped in a warm embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, the burden in her chest lightened. She looked up, her eyes catching the man&#39;s collarbone, his strong Adam&#39;s apple, and the familiar scent of his cologne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent stirred something in her, as if she had smelled it before. Yet, she couldn&#39;t quite place where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! You ungrateful bitch! You&#39;re just as cruel as your mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining her composure, Daniela pulled away from the embrace. Noticing it was Cedric, she whispered quietly,&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned to face Caiden-the man who claimed to be her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face contorted with fury, his hand shaking as he pointed an accusatory finger at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always wanted you to be nothing like your mother.I dreamed of you being obedient and compassionate.I imagined you as gentle, kind, and pure-not corrupted by the murky manipulations of the business world. When you were after Alexander, you were so innocent, so soft, like a helpless little lamb!How did you turn into someone so heartless, so driven by nothing but greed and power?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed fiercely at Katrina. &#34;This is your mother!&#34;His finger then swept over to Joyce. &#34;And this is your sister! And yet, you&#39;ve turned on both of them! Yes,you&#39;re the CEO of Elite Lux now, but does that mean you have the right to crush your family&#39;s dignity?To disgrace us in front of the world? Daniela! Do you have any idea how much you&#39;ve hurt them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood there, silent, her eyes fixed on the man before her-the man who had just slapped her, right in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She longed to ask him if he realized the pain he had caused her, if she was unworthy of his affection and care, or if he only valued the manipulated, lesser version of her from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These questions had haunted her ever since her mother&#39;s death, since Katrina brought Joyce into the Harper family and took control, and since the countless meals Daniela spent with the servants while her father enjoyed his dinners with his new family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked herself time and again. Was she not also a Harper?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, Daniela didn&#39;t ask-not because she couldn&#39;t, but because she didn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap had already spoken volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asking would only deepen her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she had grown accustomed to living without her father&#39;s affection or care and standing alone,bearing the weight of blame and criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine, if this was her fate, then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, standing tall. Her cheek burned,swollen and red from the slap, but her stance was unshaken, and her movements flowed with elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Caiden&#39;s gaze, her voice steady and frosty. &#34;I never said the 18th to 20th floors were for Joyce. From the start, I told Alexander it was the basement level. I even informed you about this yesterday. If things got out of hand, it&#39;s because you allowed it to happen. Why didn&#39;t you ask Joyce why she made those bold claims before checking the facts? Why didn&#39;t you question Katrina for not teaching her daughter to be self-aware? My money doesn&#39;t come easily, so why should I give away valuable real estate? You&#39;ve always shown favoritism.I&#39;ve spent so many years trying to earn your approval, trying to be the daughter you wanted-obedient,well-behaved.But now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her eyes bloodshot and filled with a mixture of deep sorrow and overwhelming fatigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s stomach twisted. He couldn&#39;t understand why, but an unfamiliar dread crept over him, a sensation he hadn&#39;t felt in years. It reminded him of the time Daniela&#39;s mother had almost rejected him-the time when he feared losing the only chance to improve his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice wavered as he asked, &#34;What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a fragile smile. Her usual radiant beauty now seemed shattered. &#34;Now I realize you&#39;re no different from Alexander. No matter what 1do, no matter how much I give, I&#39;ll never get the one thing I truly want from you. And if that&#39;s the reality,then I don&#39;t see why I should keep making the effort.You wanted to sever ties with me. Fine. I&#39;m on board.Starting today,immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened, her posture resolute. &#34;For me, this is a matter of finality. I&#39;lI have my lawyers prepare the documents and send them over. After that, there&#39;s no need for us to meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Caiden&#39;s gaze for a brief moment before turning and walking away without saying another word.</p>
