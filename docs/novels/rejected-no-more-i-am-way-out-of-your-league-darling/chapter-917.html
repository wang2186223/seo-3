                <p>Hamilton rarely gained the upper hand with his brother;Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton always spoke plain truth while Josh played clever games. Back then, Josh would shrug and say,&#34;You&#39;re the head of the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, Daniela handled Josh with ease, and Hamilton loved every second of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take all the time you need to think this over,&#34; said Hamilton, grinning. &#34;I&#39;m off. Got a bottle of champagne waiting for me at home, and I can&#39;t wait to pop it open. You&#39;ve really outdone yourself this time, bringing in a whole crowd to mess with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly impressive!&#34; His voice dripped with sårcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slipped into his car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stood frozen and yelled, &#34;Hamilton, you ungrateful fool! Did you forget what Father made you promise before he died? Hestold you to protect this family. Now you&#39;re turning your back on us. You&#39;re a disgrace to the McCoy name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s words cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat cozy in the living room, listening. She glanced at Nikolas and asked, &#34;Your dad is so humble before his siblings? Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be the one calling the shots?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a quick nod. &#34;Yeah. Outside these walls,he calls the shots. At home though...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton made it back home. Yet his thoughts stayed far behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept asking Joseph, &#34;How did it go? Did he really send people to clean up Daniela&#39;s place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph nodded. &#34;Yes. At first, he put up å fight. He claimed he&#39;d rather die than do it, even told Daniela to kill his son if she dared. But in the end, he gave in and ordered Brad to handle it.&#34; Hamilton let out a soft laugh. &#34;He finally met someone he can&#39;t push around. They like to play tough at home, but Daniela won&#39;t move an inch.Maybe now they&#39;ll learn something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph chuckled too. After the laughter faded, he leaned in and whispered, &#34;Daniela and her crew are strong. But don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re in Oiscoll. The McCoy name still runs deep here. They crossed Josh,and he&#39;ll hold on to that grudge forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stayed calm. &#34;For now, Daniela can&#39;t topple McCoy Group. It&#39;s too big for her to shake overnight.She knows the McCoy family had a hand in her mother&#39;s death, so she clings to that rage. Let&#39;s see how far she rides it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet deep down, Hamilton doubted Daniela would ever cause real damage. They lived in Oiscoll, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy name carried weight here. Could she really tear McCoy Group apart? It felt laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, at dawn the next day, Joseph pounded on Hamilton&#39;s door like his life depended on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hated losing sleep more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled up, face dark with annoyance, and yanked the door open. Kevin stood there, panting and slick with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton barked, &#34;Joseph, you ought to remember how lam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy! It&#39;s bad. Really bad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton eyes stayed flat. &#34;Whatever it is can wait.My sleep can&#39;t. At my age, rest is everything. You know that, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph bobbed his head. &#34;Yes, sir,but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No excuses.&#34; Hamilton spun back toward his bed.&#34;Tell me after I get up...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could shut the door, Joseph blurted,&#34;Trhis morning, McCoy Group&#39;s stock price tanked the moment the market opened!&#34; The words punched Hamilton still.  A beat passed. He faced Joseph again, his voice cracked with doubt. &#34;Did you just say McCoy Group&#39;s stock plummeted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph gave a stiff nod. &#34;Yes. When trading started,the stock nose-dived to a record low. The company is in chaos right now.&#34;</p>
