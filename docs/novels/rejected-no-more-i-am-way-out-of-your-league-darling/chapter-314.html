                <p>The moment Joyce finished speaking, the debt collectors erupted in laughter, full of scorn. &#34;What nonsense! Cedric wouldn&#39;t even look at you! Tell the truth, or you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling the truth. There was a time when Cedric showed interest in me. That&#39;s why he moved into the Harper family&#39;s villa. Daniela couldn&#39;t handle it and returned there too. If you don&#39;t believe me, go see for yourselves-they&#39;re both living in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mixture of truth and fabrications, Joyce added, &#34;If you&#39;re still uncertain, jus ask Cedric yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The debt collectors knew that Cedric had taken up residence at the Harper family&#39;s villa, but rumors about Cedric&#39;s romantic interests were scarce. They had no clue who he was involved with if anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew better than to cross Cedric or Ramon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, I know I owe you. But you&#39;re better off going after Daniela. Take her down, and you&#39;d be doing Cedric a huge favor. She&#39;s a constant headache for him, and trust me, he&#39;d owe you for that. Why wouldn&#39;t he? Besides, Daniela is loaded. Forget about the hundred million. If you handle her like you did me, she might cough up a billion just to keep the peace. And you&#39;d have Cedric&#39;s gratitude. A win-win, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice was firm, and her eyes shone with a purposeful resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric and Daniela are still business partners. He can&#39;t just ignore her, not completely. I get that this complicates things for you. So, here&#39;s my idea. I&#39;ll make sure Daniela ends up at the hospital during work hours. On her way there, that&#39;s when you can act. What do you think? At that time, Cedric will be caught up in an international deal. He won&#39;t be watching her. You should have no trouble making your move then,right?&#34; Joyce finished explaining and locked eyes with the group, her gaze intense, awaiting their response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they agreed, she could use them to get rid of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Joyce&#39;s eyes, Daniela had always been too proud, too untouchable. Seeing Daniela being kidnapped by these people would be satisfying, perhaps even sweet revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce daydreamed of the chaos that would follow once rumors of Elite Lux&#39;s CEO being kidnapped for 48hours surfaced. Daniela would have no choice but to resign to protect the company&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, no one would dare compare Daniela&#39;s respectability or talent to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t shake the thought that everything she&#39;d suffered, Daniela must experience in kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then would the bitterness consuming her heart begin.to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the debt collectors finally departed, a cold, malicious smile crept onto Joyce&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for her phone on the bedside table, she dialed Daniela&#39;s number without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get here, now. The doctor says I need another surgery, and you&#39;re paying for it. If you refuse, I&#39;ll call Cedric.And if neither of you shows up, I&#39;ll go to the media and claim you were the one who hurt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went silent the moment Joyce finished speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sat in the hospital bed, her mind suddenly clouded with doubt about whether Daniela would really show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uncertainty gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity of worry, Joyce decided to send a text instead to Daniela.三saw Cedric at the hospital. If you don&#39;t show up now, I&#39;ll go find him myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce understood that fabricating something too extreme would backfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she pushed her lies too far, Daniela would uncover the truth in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do now was wait, silently hoping that the debt collectors would take care of Daniela. If they succeeded, Daniela would be out of the picture, and she would no longer feel so overshadowed,sn ordinary, in comparison.</p>
