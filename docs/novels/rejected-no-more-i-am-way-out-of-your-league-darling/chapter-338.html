                <p>Ultimately, Alexander sold off every/valuable thing his family owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After careful calculation, he found himself still lacking over a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To gather the remaining million, he humbled himself,going so far as to beg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the entire city of Olisvine, no one was willing to lend him even a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the promise of repaying double, not a single person agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to lend you the money, but my father has made it clear. You married Daniela, then started something with Joyce. People already questioned your integrity. Then, you divorced Daniela and married Joyce. Now you&#39;re still chasing after Daniela. A man like you isn&#39;t someone we want to be connected with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kept in touch with you quietly before, but afteryour visit to Daniela&#39;s office was exposed, everyone started saying you have no morals when it comes to money. My family warned me that if I kept dealing with you, they&#39;d break my legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just being honest with you now. All the big families have received similar warnings. Your reputation is shot, and you&#39;re not going to get the money. Just let it go, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood there, frozen, a cold chill creeping down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t realized just how badly his reputation had taken a hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow, defeated nod, he turned and walked out into the pouring rain, feeling utterly lost and empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Alexander found himself at Daniela&#39;s doorstep, asking for a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if you see me as a beggar, you still wouldn&#39;t give me that much,would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Physically drained and mentally worn, Alexander had come face-to-face with the worst of human nature in recent days, and now, facing Daniela, he was no longer the confident man he once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was busy, and when her secretary came to call her for a meeting, she dismissed him with, &#34;I can&#39;t lend you the money,&#34; before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Alexander didn&#39;t give up. He waited downstairs at Elite Lux, his pride hanging by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it was hard, he preferred swallowing his pride in front of Daniela rather than begging Joyce for the million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela came out of the building, Cedric was by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were chatting, exchanging light smiles-the kind she used to give him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of jealousy and regret washed over Alexander. &#34;Daniela, do you have a moment?&#34; Daniela raised an eyebrow in surprise. Alexander seemed more humble than she&#39;d ever seen him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l&#39;ve already said everything I needed to,&#34; she replied, curious about why Alexander was coming to her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was aware that the upper-class circles had turned their backs on him, and she had no intention of making things worse, nor did she plan to offer any assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she was intrigued. Why did Alexander believe she would lend him money and continue to come to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he thought she still cared for him, it was downright absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I really need to talk to you,&#34; Alexander said,his urgency clear. A new partnership was in the works, and any delay could disrupt everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that happened, the Bennett family would be on the brink of bankruptcy. In moments like this, pride and arrogance could be set aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just five minutes. Give me five minutes, please. It&#39;s too crowded here. Let&#39;s step aside for a moment.I promise, after this, I won&#39;t trouble you again. Is that alright, Daniela?&#34; His voice was soft, his eyes pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just five minutes, or I won&#39;t feel at peace. I know you&#39;re frustrated, but please, just five minutes to wrap this up,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t sure why he was saying any of it.His thoughts were jumbled, his words lacking logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he moved to reach her, Daniela stepped back. She walked a few steps to the side with Alexander, Cedric trailing behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, no longer caring, blurted out, &#34;I know you won&#39;t just give me the money. How about we make a deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at him with indifference, her expression as if he were just another stranger. &#34;What kind of deal are you proposing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this business works out, I&#39;Il give you a twenty percent commission. That&#39;s about five million. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coolly, &#34;I refuse. Elite Lux doesn&#39;t deal with small projects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had expected that response before approaching her. He bit his lip and glanced briefly at Cedric, who was standing a few steps away.He turned back to her, taking a deep breath before asking, &#34;What about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was taken aback, confused by his sudden words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give myself in exchange for the million. I don&#39;t mind serving you, even alongside Cedric. Whatever you want from me, I&#39;ll do it. No time limit, no boundaries. I just need that million. Does that work for you?&#34; Daniela was stunned. She never expected Alexander to make such a proposition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once-proud Alexander, who used to refuse to tip less than a thousand, had clearly fallen far since his divorce from Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela... The outfit I wore to your office the other day... You didn&#39;t notice it, but I can wear it again if you prefer. I&#39;ll do whatever you ask, as long as I get that million. A million isn&#39;t much to you. I&#39;m willing to stay by your side, even if you end up wvith someone else later. I won&#39;t make a fuss or cause any issues.You can think of me as someone at your service.Does that sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric turned his head, he caught sight of Alexander kneeling before Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself slowly, his forehead gently resting against the tip of Daniela&#39;s high-heeled shoe.His body language screamed complete submission.</p>
