                <p>&#34;Guilt?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;Why should I be burdened by that? The winners decide what&#39;s written in the history books. Since when does the victor owe anyone regret? That&#39;s absurd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept his composure. After taking in Hamilton&#39;s attitude, he realized further conversation was pointless. &#34;We&#39;re not here to congratulate you. Cedric wanted us to make it clear-he&#39;s not letting this go.You&#39;d be wise to stay on your guard. Maybe you haven&#39;t heard, but Alexander&#39;s now paralyzed. If you want to avoid things spiraling out of control, an apology is in order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton faltered, surprise flickering across his face.&#34;Alexander,paralyzed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stepped in to confirm. &#34;That&#39;s right-Cedric did it himself. You might know Daniela only as Clarinda, but remember, Cedric is the Lone Wolf&#39;s leader. He&#39;s always watched out for her from the shadows,ensuring no one dared to touch her. But you crossed the line. Alexander&#39;s fate should serve as your warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flickered briefly before Hamilton recovered, a sneer twisting his lips. &#34;And what of it? This is my turf.If they&#39;re upset, let them stew. Daniela might have had some luck lately, but let&#39;s get one thing straight-here,I call the shots. Do they really think a bit of newfound success will shake me? You guys are still naive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contempt colored every word as Hamilton spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, storm clouds pressed low over the city,the sky outside almost suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Kohen stepped into the room, grinning.&#34;Look at you two, Damon, Nikolas-braving this storm just to return home, yet you don&#39;t even try to lift Father&#39;s spirits. Why waste time with all these warnings? Cedric and Daniela are outsiders, and yet you&#39;re scolding your own father on their behalf? I just don&#39;t get it. Nikolas, weren&#39;t you always Father&#39;s loyal son? Now, just because Daniela tossed a few crumbs your way, you&#39;re suddenly on her side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury lit Damon&#39;s eyes. &#34;You can drop the manipulative act! Father and Alexander set a trap for an innocent woman-how can you defend that? If you&#39;re really so bold, prove yourself in business, not with underhanded schemes. This kind of stunt only makes you repulsive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t hesitate. He strode over and struck Damon across the face. Without pause, he spun and landed a blow on Nikolas as well. &#34;If your only reason for coming home is to stir up trouble, then don&#39;t bother staying-get out!&#34; Kohen tried to soothe their father. &#34;Don&#39;t let it get to you, Father. Nikolas and Damon just aren&#39;t thinking clearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s anger flared hotter, his face mottled with rage. &#34;Both of you, out of my sight! Nikolas, you&#39;re not family anymore. Why are you even here? Go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas offered no argument, simply turning on his heel and heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon fell in step behind his brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind, Kohen called out, &#34;Damon, Father didn&#39;t mean you! Why are you leaving too? This will only push him further!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their car tore away from the house, a satisfied smirk appeared on Kohen&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton settled heavily onto the living room couch,already dialing the hospital on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital&#39;s findings aligned perfectly with Nikolas &#39;account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calculating glint entered Hamilton&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected Cedric to make a move in Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This defiance was something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela&#39;s greatest vulnerability was her terror of heights,then Cedric&#39;s, without question, was Daniela herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Hamilton still schemed to use Daniela&#39;s phobia against her, he realized she and her circle would now be wary,especially with Alexander already rendered powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed new pawns-people who could earn Daniela&#39;s confidence, blend in unnoticed, and strike only when the timing was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts replayed Nikolas and Damon&#39;s earlier outrage, their loyalty to Daniela clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed to have won their allegiance, and by all signs, she looked after them in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton knew his sons better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single command from him, and neither would dare defy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no sense searching outside the family-his answer was right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he joined forces with his two sons, there was no doubt they could overpower Daniela in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had weaknesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Nikolas, it was his ambition, that unyielding hunger for status and control. Damon, on the other hand, could never resist something new and bristled at the thought of limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet neither of these tendencies posed the greatest danger to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The true weakness in their armor was the memory of their late mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin played at Hamilton&#39;s mouth, his gaze shimmering with the promise of devious plans to come.</p>
