                <p>Facing others, Elyse was always bold and assertive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came to Daniela, she knew to mask her emotions with careful restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze, spread her hands slightly, and wore the perfect look of a helpless victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had seen this expression far too many times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were younger, every time Elyse wanted something from Brylee, she would put on the same act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Brylee, out of sisterly love, always gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you have to help me and Natalie this time!&#34;Elyse pleaded, her voice dripping with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in her chair, her expression unreadable.Her tone remained calm. &#34;What happened?&#34; At that, Elyse&#39;s face twisted with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Daniela was playing dumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With rumors flying everywhere, how could Daniela possibly not know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she pretend she hadn&#39;t heard what people were saying about Natalie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse cursed Daniela inwardly. If she could take Daniela down right now, she&#39;d already be running Elite Lux. How dare Daniela act superior to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But on the surface, she remained composed, forcing a smile. &#34;Daniela, we&#39;re family. If you refuse to help Natalie this time, Natalie and I have to take our lives!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in her eyes as she broke into heart-wrenching sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, played her role even better. &#34;Aunt,don&#39;t be upset. Just tell me-what exactly happened to Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse swallowed her pride and forced herself to explain, &#34;Joyce framed Natalie. Now the whole internet is tearing her apart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod, picked up the tablet beside her, and met Elyse&#39;s eyes with a serious expression.&#34;Is that so? Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t just sit back and let Natalie be bullied. Let&#39;s see what people are actually saying online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very top was the hashtag #TheBitchNatalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, in a calm, precise voice, she began reading the comments aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Natalie act like she was way out of any ordinary guy&#39;s league? How did she end up in bed with Doug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, let&#39;s be clear. That wasn&#39;t in bed. They were having sex inside an elevator!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would Natalie do this? Such a beauty, wasted.Look at her, crying like that.What a shame.&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t pity her. She had no issue fooling around with Doug, a married man. Now Joyce is a widow, and Natalie&#39;s just a home-wrecking slut who deserves what&#39;s coming to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone should hate Natalie! Get rid of her already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued reading with the smooth detachment of a news anchor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Elyse heard her daughter being called a &#34;bitch,&#34; she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, stop! Stop reading! These people online are just spewing garbage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela put the tablet down and tilted her head slightly, feigning surprise. &#34;Oh? Is that so? Then I suppose all these photos, videos, and gifs flooding the internet are fake? if that&#39;s the case, we should sue these media outlets immediately.Would you like me to call a lawyer for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse wrung her hands together and hesitated.&#34;Well... it did happen, but Doug was the one who seduced Natalie! She&#39;s virtuous, completely innocent. How could she ever be interested in someone like him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished, a sharp laugh came from Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes darkened as she turned to glare at Nina before quickly looking back at Daniela. &#34;Doug set the whole thing up. That scoundrel deserved to die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied Elyse, watching how easily she shifted the blame onto someone else. Her voice was calm as she asked, &#34;So, what exactly do you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Isn&#39;t Joyce your stepsister?()-Tell her to stop spreading rumors online. I&#39;ll have Natalie issue a statement, and she just needs to stay quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spread her hands with an easy shrug. &#34;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, a flicker of malice flashed across Elyse&#39;s face, but she quickly smoothed it over. &#34;Why not? Elite Lux is far ahead of the Fairburne family in wealth and influence. What, are you afraid of them?Daniela, you&#39;re not someone who backs down that easily,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Doug died. And it happened while Natalie was with him. You expect me to use power to cover this up? That doesn&#39;t seem right, does it? Besides, as you said, Joyce is my stepsister. I can&#39;t help you crush her, can I? My father wouldn&#39;t be happy about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression twisted. &#34;Daniela, ifyou don&#39;t want to help, just say it. Why bother making excuses? Everyone knows you cut ties with your father ages ago. Who are you trying to fool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression darkened with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face turned cold in an instant, the last traces of amusement vanishing. &#34;So,since I&#39;ve cut ties with Caiden and my mother passed away long ago, that means I have no reason to help Natalie,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was sharp, carrying the weight of authority.  A chill ran down Elyse&#39;s spine, as if she had been doused with ice water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back slightly. &#34;Since you also don&#39;t see us as family, please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stepped forward, raising a hand toward the door in an unmistakable gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face burned with humiliation. She shot a glare at Nina, then at Daniela, before stomping her foot in frustration and stormning out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been waiting downstairs. The moment she saw Elyse&#39;s furious expression, anxiety flashed in her eyes.&#34;How did it go? What did Daniela say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out a sharp breath. &#34;That woman&#39;s a bitch.She refused to help you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Natalie&#39;s composure cracked. Tears spilled down her face as she choked out, &#34;What are we supposed to do now? Mom, I can&#39;t show my face anywhere! You have to find a way to erase everything online! And then-find a way for me to marry well.&#34; Elyse scoffed, &#34;In this situation? Who wNould even dare to marry you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; would.&#34; A cold voice cut through the air from behind them.</p>
