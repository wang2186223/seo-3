                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face grew hard, his eyes narrowing as he stared down at Ethan, who sat slouched on the floor.&#34;Do you honestly think I&#39;m a pushover?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharpness in his tone matched the flicker of threat in his eyes. &#34;I only ever cut you slack because you&#39;re my brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethanblinked,confused. &#34;Wait.Aren&#39;twe stillbrothers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a short, bitter laugh. &#34;I&#39;m beginning to think we&#39;re not.&#34; That response hit Ethan like a slap.leaving him frozen and wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued without softening, &#34;I&#39;ve always looked out for you. I never asked for anything. Even when you kept dragging Father into it just to shut me down, I let it pass. But I&#39;m not the eldest. It&#39;s not my duty to keep everything together. For years, I&#39;ve worked like a dog, never complained.I did it all for the McCoy name. And what did you give back? Look at Daniela. At least she bothered to factor in the McCoy legacy when she gave Brad his shares. What did any of you do? During the asset division, did a single one of you ever think about me? No. Now that Daniela&#39;s made something of herself, here you are. If she was  just some nobody, would you even be sitting here saying I&#39;m your brother? I treated you with respect.and you trampled it I&#39;m done being polite If you won&#39;t leave, I&#39;ll have someone throw you out From now on, I couldn&#39;t care less about this so-called brotherhood,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stared, stunned. And truth be told. Hamiltom wasn&#39;t lying. When they split the family assets, they never once paused to consider everything he had done for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s voice cracked as tears streamed dowm his cheeks. &#34;I know we treated you unfairly. But please.don&#39;t take it all out on me. I wouldn&#39;t have come if t had anywhere else to go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;So you gor conned, and now you&#39;re here begging me to fic it?Maybe you meant to look for Josh instead He&#39;s the one who set this off, isn&#39;t he? l&#39;ve spent years protecting McCoy Group. Can you even imagine what it would&#39;ve been like if I kept most of the assets like Josh did? You&#39;d be sharpening knives behind my back Josh has taken so much already. Why is everyone suddenly quiet now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was plain. The McCoy family onlly picked on the ones who wouldn&#39;t fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sat there,sobbing. At first his voice barely made a sound, then it grew louder and louder. By the time Daniela came down the stars,Hamilton had grabbed Ethan by the collar and was halfway to the door. &#34;Out. Don&#39;t you ever show your face again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan dug his hands into the couch leg and refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing was turning into a sorry spectacle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan caught sight of Daniela coming down the stairs and instantly lit up with a jolt of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wriggled free and rushed toward her, desperation rising in his voice. &#34;Daniela, please. I need your help Will you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t flinch. Her face remained unreadable. &#34;Help you?&#34; Her tone was sharp. &#34;Did you hear something l didn&#39;t? What makes you think I would? And just who do you think you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan responded without hesitation, I&#39;m a McCoy.Cedric is, too. We&#39;re family. You should help us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled before she could. &#34;She doesn&#39;t even take me seriously, and you expect her to care about you? Give it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan dropped back down to the floor. &#34;I&#39;m mot leaving, Daniela, if you don&#39;t help me. I&#39;ll stay night here Daniela&#39;s laughter rang out-clean and cutting. It startled all three McCoy brothers at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan looked up, confused. &#34;Why are you laughing like that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned forward until their eyes met.&#34;Are you trying to pull a fast one? Do you even know who l am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s gaze shifted. He wanted to speak. He nearly blurted, &#34;Aren&#39;t you the famous mercenary leader? I&#39;m not afraid of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela added, &#34;Do you want to end up like Mason?&#34;Ethan&#39;s face went pale. The name alone sent a chill up his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile widened slightly. She passed him without another glance and sank onto the couch.Her voice came out calm, almost amused. &#34;That said, it&#39;s not completely off the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes lit up immediately at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned to her and spoke quickly. &#34;You don&#39;t need to get involved just because of me.&#34; He felt something tighten in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan pushed himself off the floor and grinned.&#34;Ignore him. You&#39;ve got to help me. We&#39;re family.&#34; Hamilton scowled and said again, &#34;You really don&#39;t owe any of us anything. Don&#39;t let me be the reason you agree to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re thinking too much.&#34; Daniela kept her tone neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stiffened. &#34;Wait. Then you mean...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned against the armrest and reached for the remote. The screen flickered on as she said, &#34;I can take your money back from Josh. You keep twenty percent, I&#39;ll take the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan went still. He turned to Hamilton slowly. &#34;I get twenty percent? How much is that, exactly?</p>
