                <p>Huey couldn&#39;t fathom how a woman like Daniela could be so strong. The impact left him feeling dizzy, as if his head was spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He struggled to his feet, looking rather pitiful. &#34;Daniela, I need to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sat stiffly in a chair, watching as Cedric fed Daniela a piece of cake with a spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you two finished?&#34; he asked, baffled. Weren&#39;t they married for years now? Their affection was reminiscent of a couple still in the honeymoon phase, making Huey feel even more pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped closer to him. &#34;Go ahead. What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Huey was about to speak, Ryan walked in, leaned down, and whispered something in Daniela&#39;s ear before handing her a tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasted no time looking at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey noticed a flash of displeasure in her eyes, but she masked it almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; Daniela said. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey replied immediately, &#34;Hackett killed Marcus!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked onto Daniela as he spoke, but she didn&#39;t even flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to suppress his suspicion, he asked, &#34;You knew about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela handed him the tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey glanced down and saw a record of a large sum of money transferred by Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused. Huev asked. &#34;What does this mean? Did Hackett hire a hitman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Daniela replied. &#34;I checked all the surveillance cameras along the route and they were erased.Hackett&#39;s transfer was sent to a high-level hacker organization abroad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey quickly understood. &#34;So, Hackett did it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric strolled in with a glass of freshly squeezed juice and glanced at Huey before saying, &#34;Do you even need confirmation? The first person he&#39;d want dead is you, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey felt a cold sweat drench his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew the truth about tha day on the rooftop better than Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey suddenly dropped to his knees, his voice thick with desperation. &#34;I beg you, Daniela! Please, help me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Save my family! Hackett threatened me with my family just yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey quickly added, &#34;I know why you&#39;re after us. You must have found out the truth about what happened back then. But please, give me a chance. I can help you take them down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;You think I need your help dealing with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy for her. That was just the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey trembled with anxiety. He pulled out his phone and called his driver, instructing him to bring something up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Lillian and the others assumed it was a gift or a check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to their shock, it was a child!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rosy-cheeked little one smiled at Daniela before rushing into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my youngest granddaughter. Though she&#39;s only five years old, she&#39;s bright and obedient. I&#39;ll take responsibility for what I did, but my family is innocent.If not for me, then for this child. Please save my family.I know you have power and influence. To you, my company or money means nothing. But I beg you,think of it as a blessing for vour unborn child. Please?&#34; Cedric&#39;s blank expression shattered in an instant, his eyes darkening with a fierce, murderous edge. &#34;Who told you that my wife is pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey quickly explained, &#34;It was an accident! I saw her test results at the hospital. But I swear, I haven&#39;t told anyone! Whether you help me or not, I&#39;d never expose your wife&#39;s pregnancy. You saved me on that rooftop that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression softened slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey continued, &#34;I beg you. Punish me however you want, but please,&#39;save my family. Hackett is out of control. If he dared to kill Marcus, what wouldn&#39;t he do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When someone reached the end of their rope, there was no line they wouldn&#39;t cross. They would stop at nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey could accept his own death, but he had to protect his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, of course, didn&#39;t need his help to deal with the rest of them. Wiping them out would be effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his words lingered in her mind. &#34;Think of it as a blessing for your unborn child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey pleaded, &#34;I know we&#39;re the reason you lost your mother at a young age. But look at the child in your arms. Doesn&#39;t she remind you of yourself as a child? She&#39;s so adorable. You wouldn&#39;t want her to grow up without a mother, just like you did, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey took a deep breath. &#34;And you wouldn&#39;t want her to lose the chance to grow up at all, would you? If you help my family, it&#39;ll be a good deed. And that kindness will come back to you. Your child will live a long, safe,and healthy life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s desperation was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent for a long moment before finally saying,&#34;Alright. But once this is over, you have to turn yourself in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey nodded without hesitaton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniola wantod no timo oollina the comnanv&#39;s ledal team and inetructed Hueu to writo a full ponfocrion detailing everything that happened that year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she summoned her bodyguards and instructed them to watch over Huey&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Huey stood to leave, he turned to Daniela and bowed several times. &#34;Thank you! Thank you for giving me this chance. I regret everything I did to your mother. I&#39;ll spend the rest of my life atoning for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey left, carrying the child in his arms. Across the street, someone watched the scene with a sinister gaze.</p>
