                <p>Cedric walked into the roomn and saw Daniela seated at her computer, diving into research about Johan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the phrase &#34;world-class professional hypnotist&#34; popped up on the screen, Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a smirk when she came across the line, &#34;acommission fee starting at eight million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became clear that Katrina had likely borrowed money from Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had anticipated this moment for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up her phone, she stepped out onto the balcony and dialed the finance department at the robotics company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suspend all dividend payments,&#34; she ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina was sprawled on the living room couch downstairs, leisurely watching TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce texted her, &#34;Mom, you said you&#39;d figure out a way to pay me back soon. Don&#39;t forget your promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reclining comfortably, Katrina typed back with a serene smile. &#34;Don&#39;t you trust me? Once Daniela&#39;s gone,everything she owns will go to Caiden. You&#39;ll get far more than eight million. In fact, Elite Lux will be yours entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina responded confidently,&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina hit the send button, Johan appeared, descending the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes, he remarked, &#34;Daniela has formidable psychological defenses. She&#39;s not easy to hypnotize.&#34; Katrina leapt up in frustration. &#34;Are you joking? I thought hypnotists could hypnotize anyone with ease!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan squinted, responding calmly, &#34;Not at all. Hypnosis comes with specific requirements-a quiet,enclosed space. I can&#39;t even get near Daniela&#39;s room. And as for Cedric, he might seem insignificant,but he shows up the second I try to approach her. Are you certain he doesn&#39;t have feelings for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Katrina hadn&#39;t repeatedly insisted they shared no romantic relationship, Johan would have sworn that Daniela and Cedric were married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unspoken bond between the two was like an invisible fortress-impenetrable to outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible,&#34; Katrina declared with unwavering certainty.&#34;Cedric likes men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan&#39;s brow furrowed in disbelief. &#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity in Cedric&#39;s gaze whenever he looked at Daniela painted a very different picture. Whether they were married or not, there was no denying they were a couple. How could he possibly like men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He admitted it himself,&#34; Katrina replied, her voice steady. &#34;He likes Ryan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Johan was caught off guard. It was rare for him to misread people, yet Cedric had managed to throw him off entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever the case, make sure Daniela is dealt with quickly.&#34; Katrina hadn&#39;t forgotten her promise to hand Elite Lux over to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a company as powerful as Elite Lux in Joyce&#39;s hands, the Bennett family would have no choice but to acknowledge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric was battling his own frustrations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan&#39;s constant appearance around Daniela left him with no opportunity to sneak upstairs at night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked him to sleep in his own bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had a sleepless night, yearning for her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With dark circles under his eyes and a growing irritation, he decided it was time to confront Johan. But Daniela had other plans. She dragged Cedric out for a movie, hoping to lighten his mood. By the time they reached the concession stand, Cedric, with a tub of freshly bought popcorn in his hands, noticed Daniela grinning mischievously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with that look?&#34; Cedric asked, tilting his head as he followed her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corner of the theater, a woman wearing a mask was giggling flirtatiously with a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows lifted as he recognized the woman. &#34;Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked, her tone carrying a hint of amusement. &#34;Well, I knew Joyce would cheat on Alexander, but this is faster than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the lights dimmed and the movie began, Cedric followed Daniela into the same screening room as Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce and the man slipped into the most secluded seats in the theater, making it clear that the movie wasn&#39;t their main focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,with mischief in her eyes, chose a seat behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, they heard Joyce&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, be gentle. Milo, that hurts. More, I need more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression grew as dark as the pitch-black cinema screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mortifying whispers persisted throughout the film, testing Cedric&#39;s patience to its very limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, lounged in her seat with her multidimensional glasses on, munching popcorn. It was hard to tell if her attention was on the big screen ahead or the awkward live drama unfolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, the credits rolled, signaling the end of the movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had come with the simple plan of holding Daniela&#39;s hand and stealing a kiss in the dimly lit cinema,but the evening had derailed far from his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the theater, Daniela glanced at Cedric, and his sour expression was impossible to miss. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to keep tailing them?&#34; Cedric asked, his voice tinged with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. Their little affair is practically an open secret. Let&#39;s just wait until Alexander catches wind of it,&#34; Daniela replied nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her eyes landed on Alexander, walking down the opposite corridor. Dressed sharply in a tailored suit, he was surrounded by a group of polished executives, clearly fresh from sealing an important deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unaware of her surroundings, Joyce was engrossed in playfully sharing candy mouth-to-mouth with her companion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander,fresh from sealing an important deal, was strolling through the corridor on his way to grab a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he headed to the restaurant, something-or rather someone-caught his eye. HHis stride faltered slightly,and he turned his head for a clearer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
