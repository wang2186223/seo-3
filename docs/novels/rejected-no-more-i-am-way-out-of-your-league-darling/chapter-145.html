                <p>Alexander finished his outburst,his anger spent,but he didn&#39;t move. He remained rooted to the spot while staring at Daniela, as if silently daring her to respond,giving them both one final chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly raised her gaze, her tone steady.&#34;Alexander, I never really blamed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, taken aback by her unexpected words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t come back for you. I was the one who chose to love you in the first place. That was my mistake.I fell for the wrong person. So no, I don&#39;t blame you at all.I understand that I can&#39;t control how someone else feels. You treated me badly because you simply didn&#39;t love me, and that&#39;s fine. It hurt, and I spent a long time questioning myself. I tried everything for you.l learned to drink, I learned to race cars, and I even tried to embrace Joyce, whom I once looked down on. We only get so many years in life, and for a decade, I chased after you. Those were the years of my youth that I can&#39;t get back. I always tried to make things between us as comfortable as possible because,even then, there was so much I admired about you. I hoped one day those memories would be worth holding on  to. But today, you&#39;ve ruined it all. You&#39;ve shattered everything I worked for. Your behavior has exposed the worst of human nature. All the things I gave up,the sacrifices I made... They mean nothing now. And whenever I think of the past, I&#39;ll remember that | loved someone who wasn&#39;t worth it. Do you know what that feels like? Your very existence disgusts me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was measured, each word deliberate and controlled. Despite the calmness in her tone, the weight of her words cut through him, one after another, each sharper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood still, his gaze locked on her, seeing nothing but the disgust in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, a security guard appeared and escorted him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Daniela sat alone in her office for hours,as if she were mourning the loss of a part of her youth that had been broken beyond hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Daniela&#39;s office, Alexander wandered back to the hospital in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached the entrance, he ran into Joyce and Katrina, who were out for a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lighting made it hard to see, and Alexander&#39;s  face was streaked with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a startled cry and staggered forward.Katrina screamed,&#34;Help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce collapsed, her abdomen hitting the ground, and she screamed out in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hospital staff rushed over with a stretcher to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander attempted to step in,but Katrina pushed him back with all her might. &#34;Get out of here! Who do you think you are? You scared the future Mrs. Bennett!Stay right there! You&#39;ve terrified my daughter, and you will pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hurried after the stretcher, her steps frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood there, alone, in the chilly night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found the situation both absurd and pitiful,but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Joyce once said she loved him? Yet here she was, too scared to even recognize him, and had been so frightened that she fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t Katrina want him as a son-in-law? Now she didn&#39;t even know who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were no different from Daniela, claiming to care but only looking out for their own interests. These women, so quick to turn away, deserved nothing but punishment for their hypocrisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the anger, Alexander pushed forward,seeking the on-call doctor to tend to his injuries.Afterward, he made his way to the maternity ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, not recognizing him, swung at him in a blur of anger. But before she could make contact,Alexander&#39;s voice stopped her. &#34;Daniela runs Dreamscape Research Institute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina froze,stunned by his words.&#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rose from his seat, his expression serious. He was deeply concerned, more than anyone, about the safety of the child growing in Joyce&#39;s womb. His eyes narrowed, and he demanded sharply, &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a heavy sigh. &#34;I&#39;m Alexander. I just learned that Daniela is in charge of Dreamscape, the one with the heart repair technology that could save the baby. I went to her today, begging for help, but she and Cedric had me beaten senseless. You&#39;ve seen how much I care for Joyce and her child. I gave up everything, including my marriage to Daniela,and even fought with both her and Cedric. But despite all that, I couldn&#39;t get the technology in time to save the baby. I&#39;ve failed you.&#34; Alexander&#39;s swollen, bloodied face only seemed to reinforce the truth in his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words hung in the air, a newborn&#39;s cry echoed from the delivery room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor entered, beaming with a smile. &#34;Both mother and baby are doing well. It&#39;s a boy, though his heart condition isn&#39;t ideal. He&#39;ll need his first procedure in two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Caiden heard that, he grabbed the doctor by the shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, you mentioned that Dreamscape&#39;s cardiac repair could save the baby from surgery. Is that true?&#34;Caiden&#39;s voice was strained, his eyes locked on the doctor. Desperation filled his gaze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor nodded. &#34;Yes, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the doctor could finish his sentence, Caiden and Katrina rushed off, clearly furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor shouted after them, &#34;But we don&#39;t know who runs Dreamscape!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed behind, his eyes fixed on the baby.Without hesitation, he reached forward and lifted the newborn from the doctor&#39;s arms. The baby let out a sharp, wailing cry that echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smile spread across Alexander&#39;s battered face,his expression twisted in the dim light, as a chilling grin formed.</p>
