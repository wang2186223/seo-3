                <p>The living room was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was deeply concerned with Cedric&#39;s well-being, more than anyone else in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent a sleepless night, tormented by the fear of losing his three hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dawn, he picked up an umbrella and went outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still out there, enduring the torrential downpour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stormy weather felt harsh, with the wind driving the rain like needles against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden tried to persuade Cedric earnestly. &#34;Cedric, listen to my advice. Don&#39;t be so stubborn. The world is full of wonderful women. Why are you so fixated on Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, his stance unyielding in the rain, his suit completely drenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this, Cedric?&#34; Caiden yelled over the roar of the rain. &#34;You give me the three hundred million,and I&#39;ll introduce you to a woman even more beautiful than Daniela, someone who shares her charm.How about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric did not reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Caiden returned inside, casting a reluctant glance back at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At breakfast, Joyce questioned her father,&#34;Dad, why do you seem more concerned about Cedric than Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce addressed her. &#34;Daniela, Cedric is your friend. You left him outside, and Dad had to check on him with an umbrella. Aren&#39;t you embarrassed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned icy, making Joyce recoil slightly Today, Daniela appeared quite formidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then looked at Caiden with a half-smile and questioned,11SO1why are you more worried about my friend&#39;s well-being than lam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, caught off guard, was unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t interested in hearing Caiden&#39;s explanations. After breakfast, she went outside to dispose of the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed by Cedric, his rain-soaked hands reached out and grabbed her sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still mad?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice was low, unusually humble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held the umbrella and asked, &#34;Have you decided whether to tell me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suspected that Daniela might have discovered the money he transferred to Caiden, and he felt the chances were significant. However, he wasn&#39;t willing to risk telling her himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reasoned that his lack of honesty, compared to Cáiden&#39;s deceit, might seem more forgivable to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always prioritized Daniela&#39;s needs over his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wrong. Please forgive me, I&#39;m begging you,&#34; he admitted, offering his apology first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply glanced at him, said nothing, and returned to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, observing anxiously from upstairs, mouthed to Cedric, &#34;Don&#39;t hide it anymore. The secret is already out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric pushed open the villa door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela started uup the stairs, Cedric, soaked from the rain, followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela left her room door open. Cedric apologized. &#34;I was wrong. I didn&#39;t mean to keep it from you. I just thought I could handle it myself.Please don&#39;t be mad at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His apology did not seem to have an effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing a puddle of water on the floor, Cedric added, &#34;I&#39;ll take a shower and come right back to make a sincere apology!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he quickly went downstairs, took a rapid five-minute shower, and hurried back upstairs without even wearing slippers.</p>
