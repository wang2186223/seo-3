                <p>The wine was served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce extended her hand to pour Lillian some wine,but Lillian quickly covered her glass, stopping her.Joyce stared at her in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you&#39;re the host, you should be drinking,&#34;Lillian said, stretching out the sentence as she glanced at Alexander. &#34;Or maybe Mr. Bennett will handle this for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was about to reply, but Lillian interrupted with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is between women. If a man steps in, things could get tricky. My family has enough people who can handle their drinks. Should I bring a few over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander froze, his hand pausing in mid-air. The wine was on the table, and the money was already spent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gritted her teeth, clearly irritated, but then lowered her head and downed three glasses in quick succession. &#34;There! Happy now? Can we get to the business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched her, a smirk spreading across her face. She was still seething over the fire video-just the thought of it made her blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Joyce actually think three glasses would fix everything? No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, we&#39;ll discuss business, but only when I feel like it,&#34; Lillian replied, her grin growing. &#34;Go ahead and continue drinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had been protected her whole life. Her mother never let her drink, and even in situations where pushy elders insisted, it was always Daniela who stepped in to drink for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, after only three glasses, Joyce&#39;s vision was starting to blur. Her head was spinning, and her temper flared with every ounce of discomfort.Slamming her hand on the table, she snapped, &#34;Are you making fun of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian crossed her arms and laughed. &#34;Yes,I am.What are you going to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face turned bright red with a mix of rage and embarrassment. She tried to get up from her seat,but the alcohol had already taken control. Her legs buckled, and she stumbled back, collapsing heavily into her chair and leaning against the table for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scoffed dismissively before turning her attention to Alexander, subtly tilting her chin in his direction. &#34;Mr. Bennett, it&#39;s your turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached for her glass to pour herself wine,Daniela, still focused on the contract in her hands,extended her arm and covered Lillian&#39;s glass. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t drink on an empty stomach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her words were soft, the meaning was clear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had a sensitive stomach when it came to alcohol. Daniela knew Lillian was teaching Joyce a lesson and wasn&#39;t actually planning to drink, so she&#39;d allowed her to enjoy herself a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, seeing that Lillian was beginning to overdo it, Daniela decided it was time to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reason for her to let Lillian hurt herself for someone who didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Alexander&#39;s point of view, though, things looked a lot different. To him, Daniela&#39;s intervention felt familiar, as though she was looking out for him once again, just like she used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled those times when he&#39;d gotten so drunk that he passed out, and Daniela would drive al the way out to pick him up. She&#39;d carefully carry him,taking one slow step after another, all the way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory brought a subtle softness to Alexander&#39;s expression. His usually sharp eyes grew gentler, a hint of tenderness appearing as he glanced at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him for a second before turning away. &#34;No more drinking. If you&#39;ve got something to say, say it now.&#34; She checked the time on her watch and added, &#34;I&#39;ve got another meeting soon, so you&#39;ve got five minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded, surprisingly cooperative this time.&#34;Joyce wants the floors in your building-the ones she mentioned earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian snorted derisively, clearly unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, on the other hand, stayed completely calm and unaffected. &#34;They&#39;ve already been given to someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused for a second, clearly caught off guard.&#34;What? To whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded flatly, &#34;Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Cedric Phillips?&#34;Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Yes. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked at Joyce, who was drunkenly slouched in her seat, and asked, &#34;What about the other floors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela considered briefly before answering,&#34;There&#39;s still one spot available. It&#39;s in the basement,right by the restroom. Are you interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression soured. &#34;This is insane. The wine&#39;s here, Joyce is wasted, and all you&#39;re offering is a spot near the restroom? She&#39;s running a clothing store.Who in their right mind would want to shop next to a restroom? That&#39;s completely ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grabbed her contract and stood up. &#34;Well,if that&#39;s the case, there&#39;s nothing else to talk about.That&#39;s the last available space. It&#39;s at market price-15, 000 dollars per square meter-and the lease is only for one year. If you want it again next year,you&#39;ll have to bid for it like anyone else. And Mr. Bennett,don&#39;t make such a fuss over one bottle of wine.Mentioning it is just going to make you look petty and small.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she spun around and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, practically beaming with satisfaction,chuckled to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After years of watching Daniela go out of her way for him, this moment brought Lillian a deep sense of enjoyment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained seated, his eyes following Lillian as she trailed after Daniela, even throwing her a thumbs-up in admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze then turned to Daniela, who was chatting with someone from Clayton Renovation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, keep talking, Daniela. It won&#39;t change anything. Clayton Renovation doesn&#39;t have the resources for a project like this. Eventually, you&#39;ll have to come crawling back to me. Huh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander settled the bill for the wine before driving Joyce back to her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was already waiting by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was out in the garden, pretending to water the plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander stepped out of the car with the thoroughly drunk Joyce, Katrina rushed over.When she saw her daughter&#39;s intoxicated condition, her face contorted with both shock and fury. &#34;How on earth did she end up this drunk? It&#39;s got to be Daniela! She&#39;s never let go of her grudge against us,and now she&#39;s making Joyce pay for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander handed Joyce over to Katrina, his mind flashing back to when Daniela had stopped Lillian from drinking. His voice remained calm as he corrected, &#34;It wasn&#39;t Daniela. It was someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was beside herself. &#34;Who would do this?Alexander, what about the shop? Did you manage to work things out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished asking, Alexander&#39;s phone rang.He nodded and answered vaguely, &#34;Yes.&#34; Had meant to suggest they go check the location and see if it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>worked for their needs, but for some reason, he didn&#39;t go further and just left it at that one word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant he said it, Katrina&#39;s face lit up with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Calden, who had been pretending to water the plants, dropped the act and quickly walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them stared at Alexander, their eyes full of expectation.&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
