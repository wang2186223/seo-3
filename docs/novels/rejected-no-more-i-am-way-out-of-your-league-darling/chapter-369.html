                <p>Cedric turned on his heel and walked away as soon as he finished speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood rooted to the spot,her gaze fixed on his retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what did I tell you? Someone like you could never capture the interest of a man like Cedric!&#34; Elyse showed up beside Nina, her face calm and completely unsurprised. &#34;Men like him? They&#39;re drawn to women who shine, not ones who stumble in their shadow.You&#39;d do better waiting for Daniela to come back-save yourself the embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lower lip, her fists curling tightly at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at Elyse with sadness. &#34;Mom, do you really think I&#39;m destined to fail at everything? Am I always inferio to Natalie in your eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s response was cold and cutting,her calmness cruel. &#34;Isn&#39;t the proof right there? You&#39;re not just a disappointment to me, Nina. Even Cedric thinks so.&#34; With that,Elyse turned away and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stayed behind, her shoulders trembling as tears spilled freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently,she made a vow-a vow to prove everyone wrong, to show them that she wasn&#39;t just Natalie&#39;s lesser sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Daniela returned home, leaving Dark Night to her subordinates to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa&#39;s entrance, Caiden was waiting. The moment he saw Daniela approaching, his words tumbled out. &#34;The police said Katrina was stabbed to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden spoke, he carefully studied Daniela. &#34;You don&#39;t seem surprised,&#34; he ventured cautiously,his voice tinged with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Caiden was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze flicked over him, his emotions plainly written across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped off her shoes and asked, &#34;What exactly are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden swallowed hard. There was something about her-a quiet menace that simmered just beneath the surface. Usually well-concealed, today it seemed more apparent, now bubbling closer to the top. &#34;I don&#39;t mean anything by it. I just hope you don&#39;t get the wrong idea,&#34; he replied, avoiding her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;The wrong idea about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched at her tone. &#34;I know you never liked Katrina. You always thought there was something suspicious about your mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was eager to distance himself from the situation. &#34;But I swear, whatever happened,I wasn&#39;t involved. It had nothing to do with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was fixed on Daniela, as he waited for her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela entered the room and poured herself a glass of water. &#34;Is that so? You&#39;re absolutely certain it has nothing to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes went wide with shock in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head slowly, her clear, steady gaze locking with his. &#34;Do you think Katrina had something to do with my mother&#39;s death? And who do you believe is responsible for Katrina&#39;s murder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a low chuckle, her tone laced with audacity. &#34;Or is it that you think I killed Katrina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came out with unnerving candor. Caiden froze, caught off guard by her bluntness. He had expected evasion, maybe deflection-not this direct confrontation. His eyes darted nervously, guilt flickering. &#34;I don&#39;t know. All I know is that it has nothing to do with me. If you&#39;re planning to stir up trouble, don&#39;t drag me into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Caiden spun on his heel,intent on fleeing the suffocating tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he hadn&#39;t taken more than a few steps when Daniela&#39;s voice echoed behind him. &#34;You can&#39;t outrun the consequences of your actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit him like a blow to the back, forcing him to halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver crawled down his spine as he stood frozen in place. Slowly, almost unwillingly,he turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he saw made his blood turn to ice. Daniela stood with unwavering confidence, her arms raised, hands mimicking the shape of a gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that precise moment, a gust of wind barreled through the hallway, slamming the door shut with a deafening bang. The sound reverberated like a gunshot, perfectly accentuating her mock gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath hitched, and the chill of terror settled deep into his bones as Daniela&#39;s smile widened. He stood there, rooted to the spot,words failing him as dread coursed through his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Daniela turned and strode gracefully into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric returned later that evening, he found Daniela already home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back,&#34; Daniela greeted him, her smile warm and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lingered by the doorway. &#34;You came home earlier than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The banquet was draining. I needed some time to myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood at the door, quietly watching Daniela.After a moment, he stepped inside. &#34;Katrina is dead.Did you hear about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;I saw it on the news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t seem surprised,&#34; Cedric observed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile didn&#39;t falter. &#34;Why should I be? I was there when it happened. I saw everything unfold with my own eyes. Isn&#39;t it natural that I wouldn&#39;t be shocked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This doesn&#39;t add up,&#34; he replied.</p>
