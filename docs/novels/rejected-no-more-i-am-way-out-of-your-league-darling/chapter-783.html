                <p>No official source stepped up to report the incident Still, the rumors spread quietly across the industry They were vivid, detailed, and hard to ignore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning, word had it the comatose employee had ingested food contaminated with parasites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wvasn&#39;t just a question of hygiene anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had turned into a full-blown food safety crisis</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As one of the biggest names in Oiscoll&#39;s dining scene,McCoy Group was hit hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day alone, their dining division lost millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damage didn&#39;t stop there. The trust crisis rippled outward. Other sectors took hits, too. Sales dropped across the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Hamilton stopped Nikolas just as he was leaving a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton handed him a report. Nikolas took one look and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This can&#39;t be right. No one should&#39;ve passed out! All we did was add laxatives-to slow them down. That&#39;s it. How could someone fall unconscious? And now they&#39;re throwing around words like &#39;safety concerns&#39;?They&#39;re calling for a shutdown? That&#39;s absurd! Our food uses fresh ingredients. There&#39;s no reason for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked as he turned to Hamilton. &#34;This isn&#39;t my fault, Father. It has to be Daniela. She&#39;s the one doing this. She&#39;s framing me-trying to ruin me! You can&#39;t believe her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t move. He stared straight at Nikolas.&#34;You still don&#39;t get it, do you? What matters isn&#39;t what you did. It&#39;s what people think you did. McCoy Group is on every move you make. That means every mistake you make stains all of us. And trust me,Daniela isn&#39;t done. This loss won&#39;t be the last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood still. He didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hamilton predicted, another rumor began to circulate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said the patient in a coma had taken a turn for the worse. His condition had grown even more serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside her company building,Daniela stood before the press. Her face was pale, her expression tight with pain. &#34;I&#39;ve never wanted much. I just hoped for a fair place in this industry. McCoy Group has ruled for years We&#39;re new, still building. Is there really no space for us?Why must it all belong to them? I used to think compromise was the answer. But after seeing my staff hurt like this, I see things differently now. I won&#39;t back down. Starting today, I&#39;ll stand at the front line. No matter the struggle, I&#39;ll grow from it. My company&#39;s chain dining business begins now We don&#39;t just take dining seriously-we treat it with care. We&#39;re not in this for prestige or profit. We&#39;re here to give every ordinary person a proper meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the business world, nothing mattered more than trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s speech struck a chord with the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, her dining venture launched with a roar. It entered the Oiscoll market with force and didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to be a setup! It&#39;s asetup!&#34; Nikolas had been blindsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed his hand on the table, his voice breaking apart. &#34;This is all Daniela! She planned this! How else could it happen so fast? Our crisis just broke, and suddenly she&#39;s ready to open shop? She was waiting for this.Waiting to strike the moment we fell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was spiraling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything Daniela had done now looked like part of a trap. She had backed him into a corner, drained every ounce of leverage he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stood there, breath ragged, something finally sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had played it quiet, but she had planned it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly understood why Charles always flattered Daniela and why Hamilton always thought he couldn&#39;t outsmart Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like a fool standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood in the high-rise of McCoy Group, facing the building across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had made her move bold and clean. On the very first day of operation, she struck hard.McCoy Group&#39;s dining business took a hit it couldn&#39;t hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela wasn&#39;t done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers about McCoy Group&#39;s downfall started swirling again. Their name was losing weight fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged through Nikolas. He stormed into the other building and confronted Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will it take for you to stop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected a single misstep to cost the company this much. But Daniela wasn&#39;t even paying attention. She was buried in charts and numbers. She wasn&#39;t the one spreading rumors. It was Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, watching Nikolas rant in front of her. &#34;Can&#39;t you see your own limits? You&#39;re not my opponent. You never were. If you want to talk,bring your father. Tell Hamilton to come and apologize to me. Maybe then, we&#39;ll consider moving on.&#34;</p>
