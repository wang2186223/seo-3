                <p>Cedric quickly discerned the true nature of the man standing before him: Hamilton was cunning and manipulative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adeptly stirred the crowd, inciting them to express desires he covertly shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing interest in their manipulations, Cedric&#39;s eyes sought Daniela, his look silently pleading for her insights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Cedric, the McCoy family meant nothing; his sole concern was to back Daniela&#39;s choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Cedric&#39;s need, Daniela positioned herself between him and te crowd, facing Hamilton with a slight smile. &#34;Mr. McCoy, you&#39;ve certainly put together an impressive family event. However, you never once hinted at a DNA test before our arrival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded with a grin, &#34;Isn&#39;t this the outcome everyone is looking for? If Cedric is uncomfortable,we can forgo the test. Don&#39;t worry about it, Cedric. It&#39;s trivial. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s demeanor was starkly different from his visit to Daniela the previous day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he had been distant and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he portrayed himself as a caring father in front of the audience, his tone gentle and soothing, devoid of any coercion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol whispered under her breath, &#34;He&#39;s just a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite appearances, Hamilton was merely escalating the situation to its limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted into chaos once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas intervened promptly, questioning, &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Are you frightened, or do you simply lack the courage?&#34; Kohen added his voice to the fray. &#34;Or could it be that you&#39;re an impostor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon interjected, &#34;Clearly, he&#39;s not genuine. Otherwise, why would he fear a simple test?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen burst into a derisive laugh. &#34;Surprised today, weren&#39;t you? You came unprepared, and now you&#39;re scared, right? No one needs to prepare for a DNA test-it only requires a strand of hair. If you can&#39;t even provide that, you&#39;re surely an ipostor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton moved away, positioning himself at the periphery of the gathering, observing the unfolding drama with a calm detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, his secretary whispered, &#34;Mr. McCoy, you&#39;ve already had the DNA test done secretly, right?Why stage this public display today? Aren&#39;t you concerned that something might go wrong during the test,even if Cedric agrees?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was well aware that the DNA results could be manipulated to suit their needs, regardless of Cedric&#39;s actual lineage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the crowd, Hamilton, wine glass in hand, responded in a relaxed tone, &#34;Craftiness is essential to be part of the McCoy lineage. I.am on the lookout for an heir. If he can&#39;t handle a challenge like this, he&#39;s not worthy of being the heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of cold determination flashed across his face as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others around him were eager to see Cedric commit to the DNA test, stirring the crowd into a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shouted that if Cedric was really a McCoy, he wouldn&#39;t be afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioning herself as a shield, Carol stood in front of Daniela and Cedric, protective and alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela appeared composed amidst the chaos. She turned to Cedric and asked calmly, &#34;Is joining the McCoy family something you aspiré to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stakes were incredibly high, involving assets in the billions and the succession of the McCoy dynasty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt compelled to pose the question. Just as Cedric was forming his reply, Daniela added, &#34;Setting aside my interests, do you actually desire a place in the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric maintained his cool demeanor. Meeting Daniela&#39;s gaze, he offered a smile. &#34;Are you implying that you have control over the DNA test results?&#34; he asked with an air of nonchalance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much to his astonishment, his wife gave a nod. &#34;Yes, if I choose to intervene, I can manipulate the outcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused, taken aback by her admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was well aware of Daniela&#39;s sharpness in business matters. Now, they were under the watchful eyes of everyone gathered, and the McCoy family would undoubtedly use their own people and equipment for the test. It was clear they intended to mislead the test results. Yet Daniela said she could manipulate the outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Cedric asked in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another nod, Daniela responded, &#34;Indeed, I could even declare everyone here as part of the McCoy lineage if I wished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s astonishment was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, Daniela reassured him, &#34;Don&#39;t believe me? Watch this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the crowd grew louder and the atmosphere tensed, Daniela raised her voice and said boldly, &#34;Let&#39;s do the test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s final remark brought an abrupt silence to the previously noisy crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned to Daniela, their faces etched with astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;What, getting cold feet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scoffed, &#34;That&#39;s absurd! I&#39;ll have the equipment brought in immediately. Let&#39;s get on with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Promptly following his instructions, medical staff entered, swiftly setting up the testing gear. Hamilton approached Cedric with a consoling smile. &#34;This procedure might seem needless, but it&#39;s useful t quell the rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then addressed the assembled crowd with a grave demeanor. &#34;Cedric is undoubtedly my son. Afte today, let there be no further questioning. He should no longer be subjected to such disturbances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he ended his speech, a significant change was noticeable on the faces of his five sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father had never shown such unequivocal support for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became evident that Hamilton held Cedric in high regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were his intentions to transfer the leadership of the McCoy family to Cedric after the DNA results wer disclosed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brothers instantly tensed, viewing Cedric as a formidable rival, their glares filled with hatred.</p>
