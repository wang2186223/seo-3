                <p>Alexander&#39;s head spun with a reckless abandon, oblivious to the curious stares piercing through the crowded room. He extended his hand towards Daniela, his voice laced with a hopeful desperation.&#34;Would you grant me the pleasure? It&#39;s merely a dance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s complexion turned ghostly. &#34;Alexander, don&#39;t provoke me into violence right here! You&#39;re Joyce&#39;s husband.Do you realize the whirlwind of rumors and trouble your invitation could spawn for Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was fully aware. Yet, at that moment, he couldn&#39;t care less. He yearned to dance with Daniela,a desire so fervent he felt he&#39;d pay any price for just one dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I&#39;m not looking for another dance partner tonight,&#34; Daniela responded, her voice steady and unwavering. She offered an apologetic nod, but her expression remained resolute, devoid of genuine regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Alexander pushed, unwilling to let the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother with another reply; instead, she tugged on Cedric&#39;s sleeve and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander caught the subtle interaction, his heart splintering in silent agony. &#34;When you chased after me before, you weren&#39;t this attached. Daniela, are you with Cedric now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, her grip on Cedric&#39;s hand firm as they turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood abandoned in the center of the dance floor, his heart turning to ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had chosen Cedric. He wanted desperately to tell her,&#34;1fyou still harbor any old feelings,I would divorce Joyce for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the opportunity slipped through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps, Daniela no longer held any space for him in her heart.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt the weight of the surrounding gazes, and a profound sadness enveloped him. Had Daniela truly written him off? Off to the side, Joyce took a bitter sip from her drink, her lips curling into a grim smile. Alexander was indeed regretting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander exited the celebration from the dance floor and headed straight to a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s car lurked at the bar&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited like a predator in the shadows until she saw Alexander being propped up by his secretary, drunk and unsteady. Only then did she emerge from her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was taken aback. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce maneuvered Alexander towards her car, the secretary intervened hastily. &#34;Mr. Bennett asked to be taken back to the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot the secretary a frosty glare. &#34;What company? Alexander is married to me. It&#39;s my call where he spends the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s anxiety peaked. &#34;This isn&#39;t right. Mr. Bennett explicitly said to take him to the company&#39;s lounge. Please don&#39;t complicate this. If he wakes and realizes I didn&#39;t follow his directions, I&#39;ll be in a tight spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was unmoved by the plea. She forcefully pushed Alexander into her car, climbed in, and without a moment&#39;s hesitation, sped off into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gasped, &#34;This is not good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was well-known that since his marriage, Alexander hadn&#39;t shared a bed with Joyce. Now, in his inebriated state, he wouldn&#39;t even recognize if the person beside him was Joyce or someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary wasted no time and rang up Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard blurted out, &#34;This is bad!&#34; He then called Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce was unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had not only powered down her own phone but also Alexander&#39;s. She whisked Alexander away to a friend&#39;s secluded villa and ushered him into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his muddled state, Alexander thought he saw Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked as he called out, &#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lifted her gaze, a sly chuckle escaping her lips, and murmured,&#34;γes.&#34;</p>
