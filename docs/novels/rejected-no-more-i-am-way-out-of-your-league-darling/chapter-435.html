                <p>Elyse stood frozen,completely paralyzed by fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly stepped out of the car, rushing to support Elyse, who looked like she was about to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re overthinking this. There&#39;s no way it was murder. So many people saw your mother jump from the building that day. You saw it too, didn&#39;t you? And your father is insane. How could anyone take the words of a madman seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s sharp gaze moved from Elyse to Natalie. &#34;Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie straightened.&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over the years, while you were abroad; your mother always said how hard you worked. I&#39;ve been busy, and honestly, I&#39;ve felt guilty about that. My mother really liked you. She once told me she wanted to cover all your school expenses. So, was it difficult for you? Did you struggle to afford your studies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest second, something flickered in Natalie&#39;s eyes. &#34;It was fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a cold smile. Without another word, she straightened and turned to the driver.&#34;Marco,take me home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slipped into the darkness, disappearing down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse watched it drive away, she fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, frantically stuffing valuables into a bag, Elyse murmured,&#34;Daniela knows something. I&#39;m sure of it! We have to leave-right now. If we disappear, she&#39;ll never be able to find anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing off to the side, Natalie retorted, &#34;She has no proof. Even if she&#39;s onto something, she can&#39;t do anything without evidence. And think about it-if she really knew the truth, would she still be this calm? At most, she&#39;s just suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s panic only grew. &#34;Just suspicious? How can you be so sure? Think about what she did today-taking us to see Caiden,testing us with all those questions, and then making that veiled threat. She&#39;s using Caiden as a warning-she&#39;s telling us to surrender!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed. &#34;I don&#39;t care what Daniela thinks. Mom, you were able to kill Brylee, take control of Harper Group, and fund my studies and luxurious life abroad. Now, I have the ambition and confidence to get rid of Daniela, seize control of Elite Lux, and rise to the top. I&#39;ll make sure the Dury family enjoys wealth for generations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse studied Natalie&#39;s resolute expression and sighed. &#34;This time, it won&#39;t be so simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela got home late that night and found Cedric already waiting for her. &#34;Where were you? You took so long.&#34; He knelt down and change her shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina walked downstairs and froze in shock. Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As strong as Cedric was, he was always so humble around Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela wasn&#39;t surprised-she was already used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he straightened up, Daniela threw herself into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, and she leaned in, aiming for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he playfully dodged, making her stretch onto her tiptoes. He laughed and turned his head away just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to give up, Daniela chased after him, but this time, Cedric suddenly leaned down and gave her a deep,silent kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at the staircase, Nina saw everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their playful moment, Cedric wrapped his arms around Daniela&#39;s waist and asked with a smile,you tired now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms and carried her upstairs. As they passed Nina, he didn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spare her a glance-it was as if Daniela was the only persor in his world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut, and only then did Nina shift her gaze away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, when Daniela arrived at the office, Natalie was already there. She saw Daniela and called out, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her head, her voice steady and clear. &#34;This is the office. You should address me as Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, clearly reluctant, pursed her lips and complied. &#34;Ms. Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say a word or even glance at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, full of pride, was furious and spent the entire morning fuming with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden walked up to Natalie, his voice affectionate as he called her&#34;honey&#34; and reached out for her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the wave of disgust she felt, Natalie allowed him to hold her hand for the first time. With a cold,piercing gaze aimed at Daniela&#39;s office, Natalie turned to Linden and asked bluntly,&#34;When can you get rid of Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes lingered on Natalie&#39;s neck with desire. &#34;How about giving me more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly brushed off his hand, glaring at him with clear disgust. &#34;That&#39;s enough. I&#39;ve already slept with you twice,but what have you done for me? Daniela is still safe and sound!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden rushed to comfort her, trying to close the gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie pulled her hand away coldly. &#34;If you&#39;re not willing to do anything for me, then we should end this.We&#39;re nothing but strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s face fell, his voice desperate. &#34;Give me one more chance. I swear I&#39;ll make a move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming,Natalie snapped, &#34;Enough! Don&#39;t waste my time. If you can truly handle Daniela, then maybe I&#39;ll be with you more, but if you&#39;re just fooling me, I&#39;ll be disgusted by even being near you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a bit frustrated, Linden said, &#34;I want to make a move, but Daniela&#39;s never asked for my help as her family doctor, not even once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze deepened as she heard his words. &#34;If there&#39;s no opportunity, then create one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at Natalie&#39;s breast, Linden nodded eagerly. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
