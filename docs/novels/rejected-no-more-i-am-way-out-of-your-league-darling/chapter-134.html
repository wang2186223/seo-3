                <p>Joyce had been waiting to hear from Katrina for quite a while, but no response came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Munching on an apple, she turned to Katrina with wide-eyed astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom? What&#39;s happening? Don&#39;t you want Alexander to be your son-in-law anymore?&#34; Previously,whenever Joyce mentioned Alexander, Katrina would quickly concur with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were always singing his praises, pushing me towards him, right?&#34; Joyce queried, her expression a mix of surprise and bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, meticulously peeling an orange, avoided eye contact, lost in her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that Joyce showing any sign of weakness could be exploited by Alexander. It was crucial to be open with her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Joyce was the sole heiress to the Harper family fortune, they had no reason to feel daunted by anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Empowered by this thought, Katrina&#39;s confidence surged. She caught a glimpse of Alexander standing in the doorway from the corner of her eye, a slight smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refocusing on Joyce, she responded, &#34;Alexander was a suitable match previously. However, since he&#39;s lost the Elite Lux project, he&#39;s no longer at his peak.His renewed interest in you? It&#39;s merely because his prospects with Daniela fell through, and now he&#39;s recalling your worth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips puckered in a pout at Katrina&#39;s blunt words. &#34;Mom, do you really have to say it that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina remained unapologetic. &#34;I&#39;m merely stating the facts. We are not anyone&#39;s backup plan. If he&#39;s genuinely interested, he should adhere to the proper channels-a formal proposal, a meeting between both families, and plans for a proper engagement and marriage. Yeah, we&#39;re rich, but we&#39;re not dumb enough to let anyone screw us over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce came to understand that Katrina truly had her best interests at heart. She pressed her lips tightly together, choosing not to continue the argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Katrina extended the peeled orange towards Joyce. &#34;You&#39;ll be a mother soon.If Alexander truly cares, it&#39;s time our families had dinner together and discussed a date for the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Katrina&#39;s attention snapped to the doorway, her expression unreadable. &#34;Alexander?How long have you been there? I didn&#39;t notice you.Did you catch all that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stole a timid glance at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair, styled in a rebellious, slightly tousled manner, was just the way she liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence lingered uncomfortably long, prompting Joyce to coax him, &#34;Alexander, please, say something. Don&#39;t you see what my mother is getting at? She wants us to set a wedding date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander understood the implication behind Katrina&#39;s words perfectly. Yet, he remained silent,casting a brief, telling look at Joyce&#39;s swollen belly before he turned away and strode towards the doctor&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Katrina and Joyce were rooted to the spot,utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34; Joyce turned to Katrina,confusion clouding her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, equally baffled, speculated that perhaps Alexander&#39;s pride was getting in the way of his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Richard, who was privy to Alexander&#39;s intentions, knew precisely the turmoil unfolding in Alexander&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had taken a significant blow because of the failed bidding, yet certain matters still needed to be addressed. &#34;I know you&#39;re biding your time until Joyce&#39;s baby is born. Just when the surgery is about to take place,you&#39;ll spring the news on Katrina. You&#39;ll tell her that Daniela&#39;s breakthrough research can save the child without any surgical intervention, promising a complete recovery. Daniela might falter at first, but she&#39;ll come through eventually. Is this your grand plan? To make her feel disgusted as payback?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s deduction was not merely a guess.It was a conclusion drawn the instant Alexander showed an unusual interest in Joyce&#39;s unborn child. &#34;But think this through, Alexander. This maneuver willirreparably fracture your relationship with Daniela.You could have feigned ignorance, yet you opt formanipulation. How does alienating her benefit you orBennett Group? lf Daniela were a nobody, i&#39;d say takeyour shot, But here in Olisvine, she&#39;s a force toreckon with. Cross her, and do you really think she&#39;l!let you walk away unscathed? And let&#39;s not overlookthe fact that Daniela has harbored feelings for youover all these years. Her love isn&#39;t fleeting. lf youproceed with this plan, you&#39;ll extinguish any hope for reconciliation. Can you live with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander kept his mouth shut, but Richard&#39;s irritation boiled over. There was no way he was putting up with this crap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fallout from this could be absolutely devastating.Thinking about the golden opportunities they had blown made him wish he could travel back in time just to beat some sense into his dumbass self.</p>
