            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>After a considerable delay,Alexander&#39;s response finally arrived. &#34;On my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s excitement was palpable. She spun around to face Katrina, her eyes sparkling as she brandished her phone triumphantly. &#34;Mom, Alexander&#39;s almost here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile was warm, filled with tender affection. She reached out, gently smoothing back a loose curl from Joyce&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;re about to become his wife, darling. It&#39;s time to put away childish things. How are things at Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce managed a nod, though her eyes darted away, betraying her nerves.going really well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of Joyce&#39;s discomfort, Katrina pressed on. &#34;Daniela really threw me for a loop this time, appointing you as a director. Forge strong bonds with your team, and when the time is right, invite them to join Harper Group. With that caliber of talent, our company could rival Elite Lux in no time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce offered another nod, this one tinged with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was keenly aware of her own qualifications-or lack thereof. Director? The title meant nothing to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if she was the toilet director? The paycheck was hefty, the duties were a breeze, and the grunt work stayed firmly with the team below her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, the job title wasn&#39;t exactly glamorous, but to outsiders, she was a director. As Daniela had pointed out,holding the title of director at Elite Lux carried a certain cachet. It didn&#39;t matter which department she oversaw. What really counted were the sizeable paycheck and the glittering prestige that came with the role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce shared the news with her circle of friends, envy was the unanimous response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, the position was ideal-lacking in stress and devoid of any rigorous mental strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a welcome change from the high-pressure sectors of finance, marketing, or risk control that Caiden had previously thrust upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she bother mastering those fields? She was destined to marry into the rich. She wasn&#39;t crafted for the grind; she was fashioned for a life draped in luxury and ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathering wasn&#39;t extensive, with the Harper family consisting only of the families of Caiden&#39;s siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people werelavishing Joyce with compliments, buoyed by Caiden&#39;s evident partiality towards her and Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce,you&#39;re truly remarkable! A director at Elite Lux and soon to be the wife of the CEO at Bennett Group.You&#39;re all set for life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Andit&#39;s no surprise, considering who her mother is. She&#39;s every bit as intelligent and stunning as Katrina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, during my last trip to Elite Lux to catch up with Daniela, I didn&#39;t spot her anywhere. However, I did notice you lounging by the restroom, snacking. It was during working hours, wasn&#39;t it? Shouldn&#39;t you have been busy working?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce halted mid-reach across the table, her fingers poised in the air, as if frozen. After a tense moment,she managed a strained chuckle and replied, &#34;Oh, that? My tasks for the day were all wrapped up, so I was just taking a little breather. Plus, at Elite Lux, nobody really has the nerve to question my schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter cascaded through the room, and several relatives nodded and gave Joyce approving thumbs-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve really outdone yourself, Caiden-such a clever and accomplished daughter! Speaking of which, why isn&#39;t Daniela here tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality of severing ties with Daniela to secure Joyce&#39;s position was a secret Caiden had kept close to his chest;he lacked the courage to divulge it to the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s tied up with work,&#34; Katrina interjected, her face lighting up with a practiced smile that masked the underlying tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt Harper,Caiden&#39;s brother, saw an opportunity in the prestige and power of Elite Lux, especially now that his daughter had completed her college education. &#34;Caiden, seeing as Daniela managed to secure a role for Joyce, perhaps she could also find a spot for my daughter? It doesn&#39;t need to be something high- level-just a managerial role would suffice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden could respond, Ronald Harper, Caiden&#39;s another brother, eagerly jumped into the conversation. &#34;And while you&#39;re making arrangements, Caiden, maybe Daniela could also help find positions for my son and daughter-in-law?&#34;(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young couple at the table sprang to their feet, their smiles a blend of warmth and formality. &#34;Thank you,Uncle!&#34; they chimed in, their eyes alight as they addressed Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their rare appearances at family events-often excusing themselves due to hectic schedules-here they were, punctually seated and instantly transforming the once sparse dinner into a bustling affair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, flashing a grin at Caiden, boasted with a touch of pride, &#34;Caiden, you&#39;re well aware of how capable they are. One&#39;s already mastered the role of a department head, and the other excels as an executive assistant. I suggest you have Daniela consider my son for managing a branch office and appoint my daughter-in-law as her assistant. For a pivotal role like executive assistant, it&#39;s prudent to keep it within the family. My daughter-in-law is not only efficient but also exceedingly dependable-she would significantly ease Daniela&#39;s burdens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ronald concluded his proposition, a chorus of glasses clinked in a toast to Caiden, accompanied by broad, approving smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden exchanged a glance with Katrina, who returned a cordial, rehearsed smile and was just about to reply when Ronald interjected, &#34;Caiden, your children have certainly carved out impressive paths for themselves, but we must support one another. It&#39;s only when the entire family prospers that we truly embody strength. You shouldn&#39;t monopolize the success, leaving the younger ones to fend for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt immediately joined in, topping off Caiden&#39;s drink with a hearty splash and turning a chastising look to Ronald. &#34;Ronald, what are you implying? Caiden has always been our guardian angel. He&#39;s the first to spot any opportunity and make sure it&#39;s offered to us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Ronald&#39;s and Wyatt&#39;s view, if Caiden could extend his generosity to Joyce, who wasn&#39;t even his own flesh and blood, how could he possibly overlook his own siblings and their children?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t see it as a favor-it was an expectation, plain and simple. Caiden was supposed to manage it all,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>as if it were his duty, without them saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere fact that they had to voice their needs already felt like a favor to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, hadn&#39;t their families extended their help to Caiden in times past? He was indebted to them. This was merely settling scores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gulped down his drink, the sharp liquor searing his throat. With a heavy exhale, he conceded, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, smiles blossomed on the faces around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joyce, seated next to Katrina, pulled gently at her sleeve. &#34;Mom, dealing with Daniela won&#39;t be easy these days. She won&#39;t go along with this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, these relatives had never shown Daniela any kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now they expected her to secure jobs for their children? Daniela was no longer someone to be trifled with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina appeared unfazed by this. She decided to let them manage Daniela on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that mattered to her was ensuring Joyce&#39;s engagement to Alexander was secured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning Joyce into Alexander&#39;s wife-that was the ultimate goal, the one thing that truly mattered.</p>
