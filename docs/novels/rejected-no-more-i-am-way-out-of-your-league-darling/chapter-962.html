                <p>Hamilton shut his eyelids, annoyed that Ethan failed to grasp such elementary calculations. Perhaps Ethan was never fit to control that volume of funds in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied curtly, &#34;You gave Josh nearly thirty billion, right? I can get it back. You&#39;ll have six billion.and I take the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The figure slammed into Ethan like a sledgehammer. &#34;Six billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fortune once stood near thirty billion. But Daniela only promised to give him six billion. An urge to unleash a torrent of profanity gripped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela remarked with composure, &#34;I&#39;m offering more than Josh ever did, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, dusk crept in, and the flickering screen reflected across Daniela&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped the station without emotion, her speech still casual. &#34;I&#39;ve offered more than enough. You&#39;ve got sixty minutes-no grace period.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton recalled that in sixty minutes, Daniela usually sat down for her evening meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sixty minutes?&#34; Ethan&#39;s tone turned panicked.&#34;Why not be direct and tell me to pick? How are you all so cold? Do you seriously feel nothing,asking that of me?Daniela,you and Josh might as well be twins! Hamilton,can&#39;t you say something to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton absorbed his words and silently proceeded to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered,Ethan looked to Brad. &#34;Any suggestions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad answered, &#34;Josh didn&#39;t exactly refuse you equity.If the loss feels overwhelming, maybe the right move is to return to Josh&#39;s side? From thirty billion to six-quite the drop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan lowered his gaze. &#34;Could you try reaching Lara?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Brad initiated the call, Ethan stepped away and said into the receiver, &#34;Hi? Lara, it&#39;s mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows,the landscape was in plain sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan walked in circles with the phone, raking his fingers through his hair, his tone broken in places.&#34;I can&#39;t be certain Daniela&#39;s reliable! What if she burns through every cent of that six billion? You&#39;ve got no clue-I&#39;m strapped, and I can&#39;t take risks! Ugh, I&#39;m overwhelmed! What&#39;s the move? There&#39;s only six billion left!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice echoed from the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad looked over and noticed Daniela still lounging on the couch, gaze fixed on the program, appearing serene yet evidently in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Ethan returned, tossed the mobile at Brad,and approached Daniela. His expression dropped as he neared her. &#34;Can we rework the terms? Let me have a little extra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t shift. The stark television glow cast a cool sheen across her features, giving her an air of detachment. &#34;There&#39;s no space for renegotiation.That&#39;s my final figure. Maybe put your confidence in Josh-maybe then you wouldn&#39;t be stuck in this dilemma. I&#39;m not going to pretend I&#39;m some saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan grasped that Daniela must have caught parts of his outdoor chat. Growing more upset, he asked, &#34;If I manage to recover it and invest it in new McCoy Group, can I get as many shares as Brad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? Why not let me in?&#34; Ethan was on the verge of snapping. &#34;Why is it that the doors always slam shut when it&#39;s me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured slightly. &#34;Move aside-you&#39;re obstructing the screen. The investment terms now differ from earlier. Any more delays, and no offers will remain. And truthfully, I have no need for your six billion, do l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan couldn&#39;t argue. After all, Daniela had wealth beyond reason. She really didn&#39;t require the funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then if the money&#39;s irrelevant, why even offer us a seat?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard that,Daniela chuckled softly,raising her gaze slowly to meet his. &#34;Why,you wonder?&#34; Her grin deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I have no idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To make you all crawl, of course. Weren&#39;t you always so smug? Thinking you outranked me just becauseI&#39;m female-or because men believe they&#39;re naturally above women? Well, I&#39;d love to see you groveling for scraps under me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever she had in mind. Daniela never hesitated to voice it. She never hid her intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t be handed much stake, and there&#39;ll be no authority over the company&#39;s operations. Everything will be locked in legally. Without me, McCoy Group goes under. That means your only hope is that I stay alive for decades. I know some of you were tied to my mother&#39;s death, and I still have to find out who caused the explosion. I plan to uncover everything. I want fear in your hearts, but not enough for you to act on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set a trap for them and was determined to watch each one of them walk right into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family stood speechless, Hamilton included, even as he worked in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all stared at Daniela, whose striking features echoed someone from the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that person lacked Daniela&#39;s ruthless edge, and perished in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now her daughter had stepped into the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And none of them stood a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t conceal her goals. She made no attempt to sugarcoat. She declared outright that she was manipulating them, and how they handled it was entirely their call.</p>
