                <p>Cedric frowned but stayed silent. He stood there, his eyes carefully watching Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People often had things they could not get when they were young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when they finally have the means, they strived to make up for that regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t always about deep affection; sometimes, it was simply the persistence of obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was their way of flaunting their newfound success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had encountered many individuals like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t judge if it was right or wrong-it was just a personal choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he knew Daniela was different from the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to form, a moment later, Daniela asked, &#34;Are you serious right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept across Cedric&#39;s face, the tension within him loosening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, still kneeling on the floor, remained motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to give you money and watch you wear something like that? Alexander, what are you even thinking? I can&#39;t make sense of it, and frankly, I couldn&#39;t care less. It doesn&#39;t just annoy me-it disgusts me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela turned and walked away. She made her way over to Cedric and asked, &#34;Do you have a spare pair of shoes in the car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric fetched a pair from the trunk, and once Daniela changed into them, she tossed the heels Alexander had touched straight into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then climbed into the car without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric made a move to follow but hesitated for a brief moment before heading towards Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, using his knees for support, gradually rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you understand where you messed up?&#34; Cedric inquired. &#34;She&#39;s not Joyce, nor you, nor anyone from that crowd outside. Daniela has a sharp mind, and by using tactics like this, you&#39;re completely underestimating her. This will only end poorly for you. With Daniela, it&#39;s already too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering his words with cold finality, Cedric turned away with a sense of dignity and left without a glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, lost in thought, unable to shake off Cedric&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him a while to gather himself before he made his way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he walked in, Richard was there, pacing nervously.&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander simply shook his head in response. Richard was in a state of panic. &#34;What now? The loan&#39;s interest is piling up every day. Are we really going to declare bankruptcy? Daniela is being SO cold to you. It&#39;s just a million! She won&#39;t even lend a hand? I&#39;ll go talk to her myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a hollow, bitter laugh. &#34;You&#39;re going to ask her for help? Dad, you were never exactly kind to her in the past. Why would she lift a finger now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was left speechless, unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander dragged himself upstairs, each step feeling heavier than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to him now that Daniela wouldn&#39;t offer any help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes carried a cloud of despair as he made his way back to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat there in silence for what felt like hours, his mind replaying memories of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had once protected him, brought him home  late at night, and was always the first to step up when the company was in jeopardy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was thanks to her that Bennett Group had flourished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, her constant support had blinded him to the true extent of her contributions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe her deep affection for him had made him forget that she had the power to walk away as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the divorce, and despite Daniela&#39;s firm stance that their relationship was over, Alexander could never fully accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he clung to the belief that a part of her still hesitated to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He convinced himself that as long as that flicker of hesitation remained, she wouldn&#39;t simply stand by and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, confronted with the undeniable truth, he found it hard to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, his eyes fell on the contact list on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was filled with names-people he had reached out to over the past weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one name stood out, untouched. He hadn&#39;t dared to call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that making this call would mean crossing a point of no return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as much as he hated to admit it, it seemed like there was no other choice left.</p>
