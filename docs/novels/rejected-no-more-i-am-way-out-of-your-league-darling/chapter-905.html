                <p>The car jerked to a stop with a teeth-rattling screech.Hamilton shot Carol a sharp look. &#34;We&#39;re not there yet.Why are we stopping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without answering, Carol pushed open her door and stepped out into the rain. &#34;Stay put.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, she swung back in and hurled something onto the back seat. After a brief pause,Nikolas spoke up, his voice uneasy. &#34;You know what?I&#39;ve been thinking-maybe you shouldn&#39;t go to the hospital after all. Mason isn&#39;t easy to deal with. If he&#39;s in a bad mood, he could make things ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Carol twisted in her seat to study Nikolas, her lips curling into a cold, almost predatory smile. Her perfect teeth flashed, sharp in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about that smile made Nikolas shiver. An invisible hand seemed to grip his spine, leaving  goose bumps in its wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just go pick up?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, rain battered the car, drumming furiously against the glass. Carol tore back onto the nearly empty road, accelerating like she had a score to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flowers,&#34; she said, her voice as frigid asthe downpour. &#34;You said Mason&#39;s a tough one to deal with, right? Thought I&#39;d soften him up wvith some flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton twisted around to check. Sure enough, a pristine bouquet sat on the seat behind him. But then his eyes widened in alarm. &#34;White lilies? Who brings white lilies to a hospital visit? Carol, maybe you don&#39;t realize-white lilies are only used for fuInerals here in Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warning had barely left his mouth before Carol slammed on the brakes, jolting the car to a stop just outside the hospital entrance. She slipped on her raincoat, grabbed the bouquet from the back seat, and stepped out with the flowers cradled in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A relentless downpour battered the city, but inside the sleek private hospital, the world felt eerily muted and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lingered by the door, unease prickling along his skin as he watched Carol step into the hospital room. She didn&#39;t have the look of someone here to make amends; in fact, the hard set of her jaw suggested she&#39;d come to settle a score.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here, Nikolas?&#34; Mason asked as he lounged against the pillows, hands encased in fresh bandages. Two impeccably dressed women lounged beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked up, locking onto Carol with sudden focus. Instantly, his expression sharpened with irritation. &#34;You just stroll in here in a raincoat? Do you even know where the hell you are? This is the VIP ward, not a bus stop for lost strays. Nikolas, who is this? Get her the fuck out of my sight right now!&#34; Carol slipped off her raincoat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s words died in his throat. For a split second,his eyes widened, surprise flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lacked Daniela&#39;s striking glamour, but something in her steady gaze-unyielding, wild, honest-threw him off balance. Suddenly, Mason found himself mesmerized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anger melted away, replaced by a reckless curiosity. He let his gaze linger, unashamed, tracing the curve lines of her figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, gripped by a wave of regret, silently cursed himself. He hadn&#39;t realized Mason could stoop this low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tense set to his jaw, he stepped between them, subtly blocking Mason&#39;s view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Carol a look, his voice low but urgent.&#34;Forget it. There&#39;s no need to apologize. Let&#39;s just leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,momentarily thrown, stared at him. Wasn&#39;t he the one suggesting they should apologize?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squared her shoulders and thrust the bouquet at Mason, holding his gaze with icy composure. &#34;We&#39;re already here, so we might as well see this through.Leaving now would just be rude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Mason spotted the white lilies, his expression soured, shadows gathering on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit back his anger, letting out a derisive huff.&#34;Good thing you&#39;re pretty damn good-looking.Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t even waste my breath. Daniela and Cedric really screwed up this time-don&#39;t think I&#39;ll just let it slide. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s stare roamed over her, hungry and unashamed. Nikolas immediately stepped forward again, blocking Mason&#39;s view with a protective glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason only laughed, eyes glittering with lewd intent.&#34;But if you and Daniela both spend the night with me,maybe I&#39;ll think about forgiving her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was livid, words already on the tip of his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Carol shot him a sideways grin, her tone light and wicked. &#34;Is that so? Well, I might need to give your offer some thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas whipped around, stunned. &#34;Carol, what are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, her smile never faltering. &#34;Here&#39;s an idea. How about you let Daniela off the hook?She&#39;s not cut out for this sort of thing. How about l step in for her and see if I can give you what you really need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s eyes brightened, greedy anticipation replacing his sour mood. His hands were useless,but the rest of him was more than ready for action.Letting someone like her slip through his fingers?Now that&#39;d be a damn shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal!&#34; Mason barked, waving off the two women sitting at his side. Then he fixed Nikolas with a look of open hostility. &#34;You too. Get lost. Don&#39;t ruin my fun.&#34; Nikolas tightened his grip on Carol&#39;s hand, refusing to move. &#34;You&#39;re coming with me, Carol.&#34;</p>
