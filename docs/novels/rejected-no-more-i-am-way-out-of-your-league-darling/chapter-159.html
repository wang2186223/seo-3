                <p>The driver struggled to make sense of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,having worked for Phillips Group for years,he had seen Cedric evolve into an impressive and authoritative individual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really how he intended to charm a woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel Powell, the driver, felt drained just observing the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped out of the car, Miguel let out a heavy sigh. &#34;Mr. Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped in his tracks. &#34;Yes? What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel massaged his temples. &#34;Have you ever even tried to impress a woman? You&#39;re going about it all wrong! Seriously, did you just tell her, &#39;I&#39;ll be watching you&#39;? To anyone else, that&#39;d sound downright creepy -like a stalker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared blankly, bewildered. &#34;What?&#34; Could his words really have been taken that way? Miguel sighed again. &#34;You scared Ms. Harper so much that she stayed completely silent for the rest of the trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scoffed,rolling his eyes. &#34;Her? Scared? No way.She&#39;s the most fearless person I know. Honestly,if anyone&#39;s scared, it&#39;s probably me, not her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he slammed the car door and strode off towards the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he vanished into the hospital, MMiguel shook his head. To him, Cedric seemed less like a man wooing someone and more like someone ready to start a confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had barely stepped out of the elevator when Cedric came charging up the stairs, slightly winded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow, her frown deepening.&#34;Was it absolutely necessary to tail me so closely?You should at least think about your reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping for breath, Cedric placed his hands on his hips. &#34;I&#39;m only here because you left me no choice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stern expression eased as a hint of amusement glimmered in her eyes. &#34;And how, exactly, did I force you? I haven&#39;t done a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play innocent! I know how you are. You keep  everything inside and never open up. Fine, Daniela,&#34;he muttered, flinging his suit jacket over his arm,frustration coloring his voice. &#34;Mark my words-one day, you&#39;ll come to me and tell me everything on your own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she pushed open the hospital room door,Cedric trailed in behind her. By then, his entire demeanor had changed-his jacket was back in place, and his expression was icy and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was seated inside the room. He hadn&#39;t anticipated Cedric tagging along, and the sight of them together left him with an odd feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one thought circling his mind was-could Daniela actually be thinking about being with Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes flickered briefly towards Caiden.Without another word, she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital belonged to Cedric, and as soon as he arrived, the director rushed to greet him in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending doctor started explaining Caiden&#39;s condition. &#34;He&#39;s suffering from severe inflammation,though the exact cause remains unknown. We&#39;re treating it while conducting further investigations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it life-threatening?&#34; Daniela asked, her tone measured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor shook his head. &#34;It doesn&#39;t seem to be life -threatening at this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a curt nod, her voice polite but distant.&#34;I appreciate your efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stole another glance at Daniela. Seizing a moment when no one was watching, he stood near the door and discreetly snapped a photo of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spotted it right away. He marched out of the room towards the doctor, reaching for his phone, but the man effortlessly evaded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a frustrated sigh. &#34;Fine, keep the photo,but don&#39;t you dare post it anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell Steele, the doctor, smirked and waved his phone teasingly. &#34;Too late. Quick fingers-I&#39;ve already shared it in the group chat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Cedric grabbed his phone. As expected, his group chat was now flooded with endless notifications, his friends mercilessly teasing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression turned stormy as he typed a curt,icy reply. &#34;Cut it out, or I&#39;m leaving the group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell laughed and shook his head. &#34;Cedric, with a  temper like that, do you honestly think you&#39;ll win her over? No wonder you&#39;ve been single for over two decades.At this rate, you&#39;ll end up growing old alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the second time that day his attempts-or failure-to woo a woman had been ridiculed.Cedric could feel his irritation boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell cast a look toward the hospital room,one brow lifting in amusement. &#34;You&#39;ve set your sights pretty high, haven&#39;t you? She&#39;s the head of Elite Lux, and her wealth could probably buy an entire nation. So, what&#39;s your angle? Marrying into her family or settling for the role of a hidden admirer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s mouth tightened in frustration as he murmured, &#34;That&#39;s assuming she&#39;d even consider letting me marry in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell stopped in his tracks, his eyes going wide with disbelief. &#34;Hold on, are you still Cedric? Did you seriously just say that? She must really be one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled and began making his way towards the hospital room,but Cedric reached out and yanked him back by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell turned back, puzzled. &#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clenched his jaw. &#34;Don&#39;t go saying anything dumb. She&#39;s shy.&#34; Russell arched an eyebrow as he leaned slightly to peer into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela radiated authority, like a queen overseeing her domain, while two nervous women in the corner looked as though they barely dared to draw breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shy?&#34; Russell asked, clearly unconvinced. &#34;Are we even talking about the same person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not shy in that sense,&#34; Cedric replied with a weary sigh. &#34;She avoids forming deep connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stemmed from losing her mother at a young age.Deep down, she believed relationships were fleeting.So she naturally kept her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had watched her closely for years. Daniela unconsciously maintained a distance from everyone.Beyond a select few senior members at Elite Lux, she rarely let anyone get close. She was always courteous but emotionally distant, never revealing her true self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her firm emotional barriers weren&#39;t intentional-they were instinctive, buried deep within her psyche.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly why he had held back from making any moves for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t picked up on the possibility that Katrina&#39;s schemes could endanger Daniela&#39;s life, he wouldn&#39;t have said what he did earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Russell, I need you to help me wwith something,&#34;Cedric said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell slid a piece of gum into his mouth and offered another to Cedric, who shook his head in refusal.&#34;What&#39;s it about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to pull up something in the system for me.Find Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s file. I want to see what her official cause of death was recorded as.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell stopped chewing mid-motion,his eyes drifting instinctively towards Daniela. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re in for a tough journey.&#34;</p>
