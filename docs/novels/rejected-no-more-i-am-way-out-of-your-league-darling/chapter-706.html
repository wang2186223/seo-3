                <p>Daniela stood at the top of the steps, her gaze coId as she looked down at Nikolas. &#34;I don&#39;t quite understand you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, visibly agitated, snapped, &#34;What don&#39;t youunderstand? You think because of your status now,everyone should grovel before you, that you can act all high and mighty. That&#39;s not how you should behave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a step forward, but Daniela noticed the displeasure etched on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the two clashed, it could easily turn into a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gently pulled Cedric back, positioning herself in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her attention to Nikolas, her voice calm but firm. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re so eager for Cedric&#39;s leg to be treated. What&#39;s your real motive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked like he was on the verge of losing his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed on, &#34;You say it&#39;s for Cedric&#39;s benefit? But why do you care so much about him? Is it because he&#39;s your brother? But I haven&#39;t seen you show him much respect. So why are you putting in all this effort for his leg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed her gaze on Nikolas&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; anger slowly ebbed away under Daniela&#39;s probing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted uncomfortably, but he forced himself to meet her gaze. &#34;Is it wrong for us to care about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coolly, &#34;It&#39;s good that you care about him, but it&#39;s a bit strange. If you&#39;re worried Cedric might pose a threat to you, why are you so eager to heal his leg? If his leg is healed, won&#39;t he be even more suited to lead McCoy Group? Cedric doesn&#39;t want to go back to the McCoy family, but do you really believe that? You&#39;re rushing to bring doctors and equipment here. I have serious doubts about the professionalism of all this. I&#39;ll personally handle Cedric&#39;s examination and surgery. We don&#39;t need your doctors or equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will ensure your brother&#39;s health.How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was unable to answer a single question. All he could do was tremble and mutter, &#34;The doctors</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles found are excellent. You don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled knowingly. &#34;Is that so? I used to be the world&#39;s richest person, and now Elite Lux is thriving.My medical research institute has the most advanced resources. Can Charles compare? He&#39;s still too inexperienced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Nikolas found himself outwvitted by Daniela. He was burning with frustration. He desperately wanted to retort, but nothing came to mind. In the end, he kicked a flowerpot in frustration and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, Daniela told Tasha, &#34;Next time he shows up, make sure he deals with the grass before he comes in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shut his eyes, the sting of humiliation seeping deep into his bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Daniela simply vanish from his life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck him like a bolt of lightning, sudden and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela.:.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next day, NVikolas visited Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Richard&#39;s eyes grew wide, his body jerking upright in disbelief. &#34;Kill Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas took a sip of his coffee and asked, &#34;Are you afraid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded slowly, his voice edged with hesitation. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas almost choked on his coffee, his voice laced with disdain. &#34;Coward!&#34; &#34;The Bennett family is known for its integrity. We don&#39;t resort to murder,&#34; Richard shot back, his pride flaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;Really? Is it that you don&#39;t engage in such acts, or is it because the benefits involved are not enough? Richard, as long as Daniela draws breath, Alexander will remain nothing more than a laughingstock. You know this, don&#39;t you? You must also realize that she will never marry Alexander. If she remembers the past and aligns herself with Cedric, do you honestly think you&#39;ll be able to live the good life in Olisvine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas watched as Richard lowered his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep satisfaction bloomed in Nikolas, like a flower thriving in dark soil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted his clothes, smirking as he spoke. &#34;Even when Alexander had surgery to resemble Cedric,Daniela never loved him. Do you think she&#39;ll suddenly fall for him now, when he&#39;s so ordinary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard hastily replied, &#34;But Cedric&#39;s leg...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a hearty laugh. &#34;It&#39;s just his leg, not his dick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face drained of color, his resolve weakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, if I could handle this alone, I wouldn&#39;t need your help. You&#39;ve got connections with Daniela. She&#39;ll sit down for a meal with you. If you kill her, you free Alexander from his miserable unrequited love, and he&#39;ll rise to unmatched success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s resistance wavered, the temptation sinking in like a hook in his flesh. &#34;What&#39;s in it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smiled knowingly, as if he had foreseen this very question coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could resist the pull of profit, except for that naive fool Cedric!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas almost choked once more. He fixed his gaze on Richard and said, &#34;If you kill Daniela, I&#39;ll make Bennett Group the nation&#39;s top company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gritted his teeth, the urge to agree gnawing at him. Yet after a long pause, he murmured, &#34;I need to think it over.&#34; Nikolas didn&#39;t linger any longer. He stood, eyes sharp. &#34;Is that so? Think it over. Opportunities like this don&#39;t come often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded, escorting Nikolas out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Kohen, his eyes focused on the road ahead, asked, &#34;Do you think it will work? Will Richard agree?&#34;</p>
