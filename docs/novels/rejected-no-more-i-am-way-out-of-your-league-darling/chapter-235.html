                <p>Katrina wondered if Daniela gave the shares to Joyce because Caiden knelt before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Daniela really be this soft-hearted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina knew she would never get the truth from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Cedric asked Daniela the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Katrina and the maids had gone to bed, it was just Cedric and Daniela left in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that he asked, &#34;You had this all planned out, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a question, but more of a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was going over financial reports from one of the branch offices. She shot Cedric a brief look before offering a small smile. &#34;Yes,&#34; she confirmed. &#34;You knew Joyce would lose it and reveal her true colors?&#34; Cedric pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up from the reports, Daniela replied,&#34;Yes. Joyce has always been stubborn and arrogant -she just knew how to mask it. Back when she was chasing after Alexander, she played the part. But now that she has what she wants, along with the shares l gave her, her true nature was bound to surface.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a slight nod. He had already figured that much out. &#34;But that can&#39;t be all ofit,right?&#34; he pressed, sensing there was more to the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Joyce were worlds apart now. There was no reason for Daniela to get involved with Joyce, let alone go through the trouble of scheming. But somehow,she had done exactly that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why, though?&#34; Cedric asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela placed the tablet down carefully, letting out a soft sigh before meeting Cedric&#39;s gaze. &#34;Cedric, has anyone ever told you that being too clever can make you less charming?&#34; Normally, Cedric would have laughed at such a remark. But this time, something felt different. He stared into her eyes, repeating his question with unyielding resolve. &#34;Why?&#34; This was the second time he had asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pursed her lips, pausing for a beat before speaking. &#34;One day, you&#39;ll understand, but not right now. I don&#39;t want to deceive you, so I&#39;m asking for your trust. Please let me keep this to myself for now.Can you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t ready to back down just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still couldn&#39;t grasp the full extent of her reasoning, but he knew it wasn&#39;t as simple as it seemed.Whatever had pushed Daniela to come back to this villa and relinquish shares worth a fortune was something significant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way it had anything to do with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had the distinct feeling he was on the verge of discovering the truth, yet the truth slipped through his fingers, hidden behind a wall he couldn&#39;t break through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anxiety grew, but he knew better than to interfere with Daniela&#39;s carefully laid plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me-no matter what your plan is, no matter what you&#39;re trying to achieve, you will never put yourself in danger. Not now, not ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked him in the eye and nodded.&#34;promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, she lowered her gaze, and pretended to focus on her tablet. As soon as Cedric turned away,she absentmindedly touched her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian walked in from outside and caught Daniela&#39;s subtle gesture. Ryan leaned in towards Lillian and whispered, &#34;Did Daniela lie again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those close to Daniela knew well-whenever she lied,her hand would instinctively reach for her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This habit had been with her since childhood.When she was young, her mother had once jokingly told her that lying would make her nose grow longer.That innocent joke had stuck with her ever since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes stayed glued to her tablet, yet her thoughts were miles away from the screen. She didn&#39;t take in a single word of the report she was supposedly reviewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce believed her priceless shares granted her an untouchable power. As time went on, her arrogance would only grow, testing the patience of the Bennett family and pushing them to their breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Katrina would step in, attempting to calm the situation with money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there would be the inevitable clash between Katrina and Caiden over financial matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be Daniela&#39;s cue to act. She would take Joyce&#39;s shares from her. Once that was done, chaos would flood the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Daniela had to do was be patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to wait for the right time. When the truth was revealed-when the one responsible for her mother&#39;s death was finally exposed-Daniela would tear them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the strategy she had set in motion, and Cedric didn&#39;t need to be part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the gentle glow of the living room lights, her eyes drifted to Cedric&#39;s handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts inevitably turned to their childhood.It was Cedric who had lifted her from the shadows, and guided her carefully through the murky depths of her depression, step by step. Now, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to involve him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deserved a life of peace, free from the turmoil she was facing.</p>
