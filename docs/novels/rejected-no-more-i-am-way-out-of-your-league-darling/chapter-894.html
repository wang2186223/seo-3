                <p>Hamilton was absolutely thrilled about the turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing brought him more satisfaction than having a son as impressive as Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d recently been on the phone with the king of Loglil, who couldn&#39;t stop singing Cedric&#39;s praises and called him a one-in-a-million talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their conversation, the king even floated the idea of an official dinner with Hamilton and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went so far as to suggest that if Daniela refused to give up any property, Cedric should simply walk away -there would always be a place for him in Loglil to shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such recognition was nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of acknowledgment that spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,Hamilton had called Daniela over, determined to convince her to divorce Cedric so he could pursue a future with the princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even arranged a substantial compensation package, intending to make Daniela&#39;s decision easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the front door of the villa swung open, Hamilton caught the sound but didn&#39;t bother to glance up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely contained pride, he said, &#34;Daniela, surely by now you&#39;ve seen just what my son is capable of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon were ready to step inside. But Hamilton&#39;s self-important tone brought them up short,leaving them rooted in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It couldn&#39;t have been more obvious-Hamilton&#39;s praise was reserved for someone else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, a silent look of discomfort passing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was entirely swept up in the wave of outside admiration that had come Cedric&#39;s way in recent days. All around him, people credited Cedric&#39;s success to the McCoy blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton accepted this narrative without question, clinging to it as absolute truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soaking up every compliment, he continued his one-sided address, not once looking to the door. &#34;Daniela,let me be clear about why you&#39;re here. You and Cedric are a mismatch. His abilities are meant for greater things. It&#39;s time for you to end this marriage. Cedric will walk away empty-handed. Everything he&#39;s earned will stay with you. On top of that, I&#39;m offering this check as a parting gift. Take it and leave Oiscoll for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He presented the check without ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon couldn&#39;t stay silent-he stormed forward, voice raised. &#34;Dad, what are you doing? You can&#39;t just throw money at Daniela and expect her to walk away from Cedric! That&#39;s beyond unfair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep scowl formed as Hamilton glanced toward the door, only to realize Daniela wasn&#39;t even in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His earlier good mood slipped away. &#34;Why are you all here? I asked to see Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s protest was firm. &#34;Dad, I really don&#39;t get why you&#39;re pushing so hard. Cedric and Daniela are happy together. There&#39;s no plotting or scheming between them. Divorce is the last thing on their minds!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know nothing,&#34; Hamilton retorted. &#34;The only reason they&#39;re still together is because I haven&#39;t raised the stakes high enough yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flourish, Hamilton brandished the check for everyone to see. &#34;Take a good look. This is what I&#39;m putting on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s eyes went wide as he read the amount. &#34;A billion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could deny that was an astonishing sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric walks away with empty hands, and I&#39;m offering Daniela a billion, no strings attached. She stands to gain everything from this divorce. What else could she possibly want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon could barely process what he was hearing. A billion-such a staggering figure!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the lavish spending among the brothers over the years didn&#39;t even come close to that amount. He suddenly saw just how much Hamilton valued Cedric-an affection that ran impossibly deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Damon refused to accept it. &#34;Dad, you can&#39;t just throw money around to break up a marriage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no patience for pointless debates. Someone get Joseph in here! I want Daniela brought to me at once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave the order, gesturing for the housekeeper to fetch Joseph immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Nikolas interjected, &#34;Don&#39;t bother sending anyone. Daniela isn&#39;t coming. She doesn&#39;t wish to see you. You&#39;d do better to spend your energy on the real problems facing McCoy Group instead of chasing the impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton dismissed Nikolas&#39; words without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned breath, Nikolas shook his head. &#34;If that&#39;s your attitude, I&#39;ve got nothing left to add.&#34; He turned and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon followed after him, leaving the space quiet until Joseph finally slipped in. &#34;Mr. McCoy, I&#39;ve observed something. Nikolas and Carol-Daniela&#39;s assistant-seem far closer than one might expect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brows drew together, his tone turning cold.′′|sthat so?&#34;</p>
