                <p>When Cedric saw Hamilton&#39;s message, the faint smile on his lips dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCoy Group held substantial economic influence in Oiscoll, with countless business deals ultimately tracing back to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During a recent deal, just after Cedric finalized the agreement, he was told the other party&#39;s leadership had changed. The new head was none other than Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered,&#34;I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;I&#39;ll go.You&#39;ve been worn out lately. The opening ceremony is mostly for show;it won&#39;t take more than fifteen minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt there was no reason to tire Daniela with something so trivial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela&#39;s worry, Nikolas offered,&#34;I&#39;ll go with Cedric.I know that company well,and it&#39;s near Sunrise Company.It&#39;s hot outside-no need for you and Carol to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas figured there was no need for a big group at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>such a minor event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day. as Nikolas saw the princess of Loglil step out of the car,it hit him-he had underestimated the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s absence at the opening ceremony puzzled Nikolas. He&#39;d expected Hamilton to have an extended talk with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,Hamilton stayed away entirely, sending only a junior manager in his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That eased Nikolas&#39; tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, as the biggest shareholder, stepped forward to cut the ribbon. Just as he stepped down, someone rushed and bumped into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric steadied the person gently and said, &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caused the person to pause. Cedric looked up, surprised, to see a young woman standing before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back two paces and raised his hand politely.&#34;This way,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing anyone here,Cedric assumed the woman hurrying toward the stage was a staff member. So he courteously moved aside. &#34;Thank you.&#34; The young woman slowly raised her eyes,cheeks tinged with pink, but she didn&#39;t hurry away. She glanced up at Cedric and smiled softly. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re very tall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman smiled once more, her face flushed, and whispered,&#34;We&#39;ll meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t catch the meaning behind her words.From a distance, Nikolas watched, nearly choking back surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried forward, but before he could reach them,the young woman had slipped something into Cedric&#39;s hand and vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced down at the object now resting in his palm. It looked like a badge of some kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas arrived, panting heavily. &#34;Oh no! I rushed here,but I&#39;m too late. You&#39;re in deep trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned. &#34;What do you mean? That staff member just now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then realized something. &#34;She&#39;s not a staff member.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed the item to a nearby staff member.&#34;Excuse me,that young woman forgot something,&#34;he said,nodding toward her as she walked away. &#34;Could you please give this back to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member eagerly took off after her. Near the entrance, he caught up and handed the item back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, they saw the woman glance back,eyes glistening with tears, as if wounded by a lover&#39;s betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clicked his tongue. &#34;Cedric, she gave it to you,and you handed it right back. That must&#39;ve been humiliating for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave him a sharp look. &#34;You&#39;re always ready with the sarcasm.What was that,anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shook his head with a sigh. &#34;She&#39;s the sole princess of Loglil. What she handed you was the royal emblem-a symbol of her interest and a wish for you to become her husband. What you just declined wasn&#39;t just a token. It was a sign of power, wealth, and ultimate authority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at Cedric, whose face stayed composed. &#34;Now that you know, do you regret it?Want me to help you win her back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric showed no sign of interest and turned to walk away.&#34;If you&#39;re that keen, you can be her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sighed deeply. &#34;You think I wouldn&#39;t want that? Father once arranged for all five of us brothers to be candidates for the princess, but she rejected every one of us. Father was furious. Now that the princess has chosen you,Father won&#39;t let this opportunity go.</p>
