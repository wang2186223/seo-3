                <p>Daniela was buried in data, her focus unwavering,when a knock at the door broke her concentration.She lifted her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol announced, &#34;Cedric&#39;s here. He&#39;s brought some of your favorite homemade dishes.Should I let him in?&#34;Daniela placed her pen aside,expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped aside, allowing Cedric to enter.He lingered at the doorway, waiting for Daniela&#39;s approval before stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at the dining table, Daniela watched as Cedric carefully unpacked the food, lining up each dish with quiet precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them were homemade pickles-bright, crisp,and brimming with tangy freshness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a bite, savoring the sharp yet refreshing taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent,hesitation flickering in his eyes.He feared speaking would either disturb the moment or worse, Daniela would bring up divorce again. So,he chose silence, settling into the seat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela never felt the need for words during meals.Silence suited her just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she was done, Cedric cleaned up and left,not lingering a second longer than necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening,he returned again-this time with freshly prepared side dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing from the side, Carol couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;These dishes are not just well-made-they&#39;re exquisite. Daniela doesn&#39;t eat much, but she loves variety. Did you make these yourself, or did someone else do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carol spoke, Cedric caught the subtle flicker of Daniela&#39;s gaze in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded with sincerity,&#34;I made them myself.I can cook just about anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Daniela had been pregnant, battling relentless morning sickness, it was Cedric who had taken care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew her preferences better than he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, as always, ate in silence. As soon as she was done, Cedric tidied up and quietly made hisexit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Cedric was gone, Carol&#39;s cheerful demeanor faded. &#34;Daniela, is he just a really good actor? I can&#39;t see through him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing. She simply took a slow sip of water, then turned back to her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Cedric showed up once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Daniela didn&#39;t touch the food. She leaned back,watching him with a slow, knowing smile.&#34;What&#39;s this, Cedric? Have you developed a habit of playing delivery boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, sunlight spilled into the room, golden and soft, wrapping everything in its gentle warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handsome man flushed, a deep crimson creeping from his cheeks to the tips of his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I listened to you,&#34; Cedric murmured, his voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms folded, Daniela studied him-bathed in the sunlight, looking almost unreal. In that moment,she understood why she had been drawn to him in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was unexpectedly shy when she teased him What do you mean? Daniela arched a brow She knew he meant her offhanded tsk at the aurtion but played along</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s long lashes trembled under the sunlight.his hesitation making him look almost fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the auction,&#34; he finally admitted,embarrassment lacing his voice. Maybe he knew she was pretending not to remember, but that didn&#39;t matter. &#34;You didn&#39;t want me to bid, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head. &#34;Did l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words lingered in the air, the blush on Cedic&#39;s ears deepened, trailing down his neck and disappearing beneath the collar of his crisp white shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; His voice was soft but certain, carrying a quiet,unwavering clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t refute it.&#34;So,you now expect a reward?Is that why you keep bringing me meals?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on his face. &#34;How long are you planning to keep this act going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric parted his lips as if to speak, then hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the subtle tremor of his lashes, Daniela said evenly,&#34;The reward ends now. Don&#39;t come tonight.&#34; Disappointment flickeredacross Cedric&#39;s fare unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela, with no memories to tether her, wasn&#39;t someone who could be easily moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she said no more,she meant it-no exceptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, Cedric carefully set down the food before asking, &#34;If I listen next time,will you reward me again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned and walked away without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Cedric left, Carol strolled in, looking thoroughly entertained. &#34;Whoa! Who would&#39;ve guessed? The ruthless dark horse of the business world, reduced to this? Daniela, even I&#39;m strugglingto handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who dominated boardrooms with an iron grip was smiling like a lovesick fool in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either he was an exceptional actor, or he was hopelessly in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol couldn&#39;t tell which was the truth.</p>
