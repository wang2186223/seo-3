                <p>Elyse let out a deep sigh after hearing those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I just don&#39;t get it. You&#39;ve changed so much.You used to listen, but now you&#39;re always so emotional. I&#39;m your mother, and I won&#39;t hold this against you, but you really need to reconsider. I&#39;m your mother, after all. If my life is getting better,shouldn&#39;t you be happy for me? It would make things easier for you,wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie squinted at Elyse,her gaze sharp. &#34;So, you&#39;re admitting Daniela has helped improve your life, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the question was asked, Elyse froze for a brief moment. Quickly regaining her composure, she put on a stern expression. &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about,&#34; she said, hurrying after Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing something was wrong, Natalie turned to Nina.&#34;Nina, I&#39;m sure Mom&#39;s hiding something from us.Want to team up and find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina scoffed, &#34;Now you want to team up? It&#39;s too late for that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Natalie could respond, Nina turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood still, calling out to Nina&#39;s disappearing form.&#34;Fine! If I find out Daniela gave Mom something.you won&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina spun around,flipping Natalie the bird,making her seethe with anger. In her frustration, Natalie kicked a nearby tree,only to hurt herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden stood off in the distance, observing as Natalie climbed into a taxi alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela was about to enter her car, a familiar face caught her eye from the corner of her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her gaze and saw a face that was the spitting image of Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had told her he had an international meeting that evening and might not be able to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved enthusiastically, calling out, &#34;Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure hesitated for a moment in the dim light before crouching and entering the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood frozen, her mind swirling in confusion as she stared in the direction of the car for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got your attention, Daniela?&#34; Lillian poked her head out to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her gaze on the car as it continued to distance itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; she replied as she climbed into her own car,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must have been an illusion.&#34; Inside the car, Daniela couldn&#39;t shake the thoughts of what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was practically glowing with excitement.&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re so generous! You just bought that massive piece of land like it was nothing.Are you seriously planning to build me a retirement home there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was sitting in the front, with Daniela in the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse twisted her neck slightly to look back at Daniela,still beaming. When Daniela said, &#34;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy with it, Aunt Elyse,&#34;her smile only widened,and she even hummed joyfully in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed silent throughout the entire ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up to Elyse&#39;s lavish mansion. Elyse exited the vehicle, bending slightly and flashing a smile at Daniela. &#34;Take care on your way back, Daniela.&#34;Her voice oozed with exaggerated flattery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied Elyse&#39;s overly ingratiating expression under the streetlights and reminded her coolly, &#34;I&#39;ve kept my promise to provide for your retirement,Aunt Elyse. I hope you&#39;ll keep yours as well. If the Harper family comes asking for handouts every month.I won&#39;t be able to keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s words, Elyse waved her hand quickly. &#34;Of course, Daniela. You&#39;re the best to me. I won&#39;t tell anyone about this.&#34;Daniela gave a subtle glance towards Natalie, who was eavesdropping from a distance, nodded slightly, and then told the driver, &#34;Drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as the car disappeared into the distance, Elyse continued waving at the dissipating exhaust fumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so overcome with joy that she couldn&#39;t help but dance, but when she turned around, she was startled to find Natalie standing quietly behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you sneak up behind me, Natalie?&#34;Elyse gasped,surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes, studying her closely.&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Do you have secrets you&#39;re hiding from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse toyed with her hair nervously. &#34;You&#39;re imagining things, my dear. What could I possibly be hiding?I&#39;m exhausted tonight, so I&#39;m heading to bed. Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie trailed Elyse into the house, her eyes focused intently on her profile. &#34;Mom, remember you once said you wanted to have Daniela killed? I&#39;ve already reached out to Cealmaur. If we pay them enough.they&#39;ll take care of it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cealmaur, the world&#39;s largest mercenary group,was infamous for its assassination services, charging the highest fees but also boasting an unblemished record of success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they took on a mission, the target never lived more than 24 hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was momentarily lost in thought. &#34;Really? How much would it cost?&#34; she asked, sipping her water while mentally calculating the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela were to die, all her wealth would go to Cedric. She thought it would be wiser to have Daniela fulfill her promises first, ensuring her own future was secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had handed her such a massive plot of land without even blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relying on Natalie or Nina wasn&#39;t nearly as dependable as counting on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the wheels turning in Elyse&#39;s mind, Natalie answered, &#34;They quoted one hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse almost choked on her water. &#34;How much did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing had even unfolded, and they were already demanding such a steep price from her.</p>
