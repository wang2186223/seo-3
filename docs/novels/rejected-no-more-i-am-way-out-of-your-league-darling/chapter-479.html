                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes blazed with anger. &#34;Well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nina appeared out of nowhere,her lips curled in a mocking grin. &#34;Are you suggesting that Natalie&#39;s relationship with Linden isn&#39;t genuine? That they have no plans to marry? Mom, I&#39;m quite confused. What&#39;s the purpose behind all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she finished speaking than Elyse fixed Nina with an intense glare,her teeth clenched as she hissed a warning. &#34;Ninal Have you lost your senses?Utter another word,and you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remained composed. &#34;I&#39;ve long been dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emotional death came the day Elyse forced her into Linden&#39;s bed and the public disgrace she endured on her wedding day, kidnapped and displayed throughout the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stumbled out of the hotel after Linden had his way of her. Her eyes were full of shame,telling a story that words couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing more humiliating than being forced to sleep with someone she found very disgusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie stepped out, she caught sight of Elyse &#34;When is Daniela going to pay you? What else does  she want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse appeared distressed. &#34;Daniela mentioned you need to marry Linden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes grew wide in shock. &#34;What? Is she insane? Marrying Linden would destroy my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had indeed been intimate with Linden,but what of it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have her hymen repaired and pretend to be a virgin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to marry? To someone like Linden, who would so easily agree to a divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How would she climb the social ranks once again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her teeth. &#34;I absolutely refuse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, who was picking his teeth, stepped out of the hotel and overheard Natalie&#39;s words. He let out a quiet laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled Natalie close and kissed her forcefully.&#34;Still as stubborn as ever, aren&#39;t you? Soon, you&#39;ll come crawling back to me, just like last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Linden walked away, his words still lingering in the air,a look of success spread across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned sharply to Elyse, her tone full of blame.&#34;Mom,you don&#39;t understand how horrible Linden is! He tortured me all night long! He&#39;s even more rotten than Doug.&#34; As she spoke, Natalie rolled up her sleeve to show many marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Elyse, experienced as she was, couldn&#39;t suppress a gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse examined the marks on Natalie&#39;s arm, then stared off into the distance, falling silent for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she spoke. &#34;Natalie, darling,there are only two ways out of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at her eagerly. &#34;What are they? Mom,I can&#39;t endure another day without money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden had even made her pay for the motel,leaving her penniless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had brought her to a run-down motel, its walls heavy with the smell of musty cigarette smoke,almost suffocating her with the foul smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Natalie truly grasped the full extent of the terror that came with poverty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie longed with all her heart to regain the life she had once known, wishing she would never again find herself caught up with a bastard like Linden, praying for the nightmare to finally end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie,&#34; Elyse whispered, gazing at her daughter&#39;s face. &#34;One option is to marry Linden. Let Daniela offer you a generous dowry, purchase our old villa,and transfer it to vou This would provido.some</p>
                
                
                
                <p>security,and we could strategize further from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Natalie declared, &#34;I&#39;ll take the second option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear the thought of seeing Linden again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of his disgusting face lingered in her mind.a haunting mark she desperately wished to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse continued, &#34;The second option is Doug. Winning his favor could solve your financial worries, but it would cost you your reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug had a reputation for openly boasting about his affairs, often going as far as recording them to show off to his acquaintances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Natalie ever became involved with Doug,it only meant there would be no hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would forever tarnish Natalie&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The advantage is immediate wealth. Doug is lavish with his girlfriends. He offers a hundred million the first night and continues to provide support. This is what happened to Joyce when she was desperate.At least now, she no longer struggles financially.If you attract Doug&#39;s attention, the money will never stop.Natalie, these are the only options I see. Make your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only was Natalie desperate to avoid poverty, but Elyse was too. She even regretted getting rid of Brylee. Brylee might have valued their sisterly relationship, unlike Daniela, the relentless woman determined on their downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder what drives Daniela&#39;s madness. Sure, Brylee was her mother but left when she was just five. Does Daniela really need to seek revenge against us? After all, we&#39;re some of the few family members she has left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was not ready to give up. &#34;Perhaps I should appeal to Daniela once more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood firm, gazing into the distance, holding Elyse back. &#34;Mom, don&#39;t go. Daniela is heartless and will show no mercy.I&#39;ve made my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked at Natalie in disbelief. &#34;Linden or Doug?</p>
