                <p>Daniela stepped back through the door, finally home from her business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could even place her luggage down, Josie darted toward her, her face etched with panic.&#34;Daniela, Nina&#39;s gone missing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was steady, though her mind raced.&#34;How long has she been gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s words tumbled out in a rush. &#34;She left after lunch, saying she&#39;d be back for dinner. It&#39;s nine now,and she hasn&#39;t come back. I&#39;ve called her over and over, but there&#39;s no answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A line of concern deepened on Daniela&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a member of the Wesker family. Given Nina&#39;s  complicated ties with the Dury family, they worried she&#39;d be overlooked at the wedding and so had brought a lavish set of gold jewelry as a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian greeted them with a serene smile, walking to the door. &#34;The bride is occupied with last-minute preparations. She&#39;s out getting a beauty treatment and won&#39;t be coming down to thank you personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the guest&#39;s expression changed as they read something on their phone. They glanced at the screen, their demeanor turning grave, before showing it to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was blunt and direct, Nina, the bride,had been missing for eight hours leading up to the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela moved closer and skimmed the name of the sender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jarrett Morphew, a reporter from the gossip outlet, Bubble Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a sound, Daniela spun on her heel and headed inside to call Ryan. &#34;Buy Bubble Entertainment in the next ten minutes. Have a reporter named Jarrett Morphew call me,&#34; she ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a polite smile to the confused guest.&#34;We&#39;ve received your gift. She&#39;ll be at the wedding by eight tomorrow morning, for sure. Goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she closed the door with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela&#39;s phone buzzed-Sammy was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, is Nina really missing?&#34; Sammy&#39;s voice crackled with concern, though he kept his tone respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence lingered before Sammy spoke again.&#34;May I ask why?&#34;  Daniela&#39;s response was cool and measured. &#34;It&#39;s a family matter, and I&#39;m not going into details. If your wedding is still holding tomorrow, you&#39;ll know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela ended the call without hesitation,and almost immediately, Jarrett&#39;s call rang through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get wind of Nina&#39;s disappearance?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jarrett was taken aback by how quickly Daniela had taken control of the company. It had been just ten minutes since the message went out, and already Bubble Entertainment had a new owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claiming he wasn&#39;t afraid would have been an outright lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a hesitant tone, Jarrett responded, &#34;An unknown number rang me. I traced it back to the owner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he continued, &#34;It&#39;s someone from the Dury family. Her name is Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t hold back a burst of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what&#39;s the Dury family up to? Are they  trying to tarnish Nlina&#39;s name so she can&#39;t get married? Why would they do this? What&#39;s in it for them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed with a sharp focus. She dialed Elyse&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice was tinged with surprise. &#34;Daniela,what&#39;s going on? How do you have time to call me now? Is something wrong? I&#39;m at the beauty salon,prepping for Nina&#39;s wedding tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared into the dark expanse outside. &#34;Nina is missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Is that so?&#34; Elyse put on a facade of surprise.&#34;What should we do now? If the bride doesn&#39;t show up tomorrow, can the wedding still happen? But honestly, it&#39;s nothing. Daniela, youI&#39;re more than capable. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find her and make sure everything goes smoothly, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice chilled. &#34;Aunt Elyse, are you absolutely sure you don&#39;t know where Nina is?&#34; Elyse let out a forced laugh. &#34;Me? How could I possibly know? Isn&#39;t she with you? I haven&#39;t seen her in forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie grew frantic. &#34;That&#39;s impossible! Nina must&#39;ve gone home. She said she was going to grab the gold bracelet her father gave her, and then she vanished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse scoffed dismissively. &#34;Really? I haven&#39;t seen her. Besides, an adult isn&#39;t officially missing until 24hours have passed. You all are overreacting. Daniela,young women like Nina can be unpredictable. Sure,you&#39;ve found her a good match, but maybe she&#39;s like your stepsister Joyce, off with some man somewhere. You&#39;re stressing over nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s fury bubbled up, her face darkening with anger. She had never encountered such an irresponsible mother in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression stayed unmoved, her face a picture of calm. &#34;It seems I care more about Nina than you, Aunt Elyse. Your daughter goes missing before her wedding, and you act like you&#39;re just hoping she wakes up in some man&#39;s bed. Aunt Elyse,  what goes around comes around. Bad deeds always find their way back, like a boomerang, striking when you least expect it. I&#39;m not in a rush. Let&#39;s wait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse slammed the phone down in anger and turned to Natalie. &#34;Sweetheart, what do we do now?Daniela&#39;s back, and she&#39;s a force to be reckoned with. If she finds Nina before the wedding and Nina marries Sammy, we&#39;ll lose all control over her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. She unlocked her phone and watched a video of Nina&#39;s desperate screams. With a chilling smile, she looked at Elyse and said, &#34;The Wesker family won&#39;t want her anymore.&#34;</p>
