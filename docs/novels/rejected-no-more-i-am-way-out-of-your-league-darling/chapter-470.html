                <p>What is it that scares you so much? Why is it that you can share everything with the world, yet when it comes to me, you always ask me to wait?&#34;Cedric pressed,his voice full of frustration</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Daniela&#39;s face slowly faded. and eventually,her expression became blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at her and let out a mocking laugh.&#34;What are you planning now? Are you going to tell me to forget about it if I reach the point where i can&#39;t take it anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought back a smile, seeing Daniela&#39;s expression confirm his guess. A wave of sadness hit him. He nodded and said, &#34;Alright then. Do it your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric stood up. Daniela&#39;s heart squeezed with emotion. and she reached out to grab his hand.&#34;Cedric,would you be able to give me just a bit more time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric forced a bitter smile. &#34;Daniela, you know l&#39;d give you as much time as you need, even a lifetime.But I can&#39;t keep living with this constant feeling of being shut out. It&#39;s like...I mean nothing to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela heard the echo of his footsteps on the floor as she turned her head and saw Cedric opening the  front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light from outside poured in, bathing him in a golden glow. But just as quickly, it disappeared when the door began to close slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in the still, cold silence,her hands and feet frozen with the chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed on the sofa all night, waiting, but Cedric never came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cupcakes she had bought the previous night had turned cold and hard, but she ate them for breakfast anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, observing with a pity look, suggested, &#34;Why not just tell him? It&#39;s just that trivial past, right? It&#39;s possible that Cedric could manage it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;No. No one is allowed to tell him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan exhaled heavily. &#34;This time, it might be difficult to calm him down. He&#39;s really upset. He even left home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A migraine began to throb in Daniela&#39;s head. She headed upstairs to change her clothes, with plans to make breakfast and bring it to Cedric as a way of making peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the door, Lillian scrolled through her tablet while talking to Daniela. &#34;Natalie&#39;s reputation is completely destroyed, and Elyse, who sacrificed her  daughter&#39;s future for fame, is scomed throughout Olisvine. The hotel called to say they spent over eight million last night and can&#39;t cover the cost. They&#39;re asking what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered with determination. &#34;Call the police and have them arrested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded,then asked Daniela,&#34;Caiden is crying and begging to see you.Will you go,Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela poured oatmeal into a thermos.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had expected as much. &#34;The man who looked Hke Cedric at the last banquet is still under investigation. It&#39;s odd. After that brief appearance, he seemed to disappear, as if...&#34; She paused, searching for the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught on quickly. &#34;As if he deliberately stirred up trouble and then vanished to watch the chaos unfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian touched her forehead,relieved. &#34;Exactly! That&#39;s exactlyit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grabbed the thermos. &#34;Ignore it. Those who need to show up will eventually do so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian agreed, laughing at Daniela. &#34;You&#39;re off to make peace with Cedric. I won&#39;t join you. Never thought I&#39;d see the day, and Cedric is really holding his ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled wryly at the teasing tone in Lillian&#39;s voice. She had never thought she would one day be preparing breakfast to appease a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela reached the entrance of Phillips Group.the head of security approached her with evident enthusiasm. &#34;Good morning, Ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been buried with work and rarely visited Phillips Group, so the security guard hurried over as soon as he spotted her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This took Daniela by surprise. The head of security was someone she hadn&#39;t seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her confused look, he smiled and said,&#34;Here in Olisvine, everyone knows you as Mr. Phillips&#39; wife It&#39;s not just me, even our newest employees recognize you. When Mr. Phillips was in a coma,you led the company,and though it was only for a short time.your leadership left a lasting impression on everyone at Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out of the car with the thermos, just as Cedric&#39;s secretary hurried out of the elevator. &#34;Ma&#39;am.you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, the staff at Phillips Group were doubtful about Daniela, puzzled over why their CEO was so committed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all,Phillips Group was not lacking in any way. owever after seeing Daniela&#39;s decisive leadershi. they were all impressed,hoping their CEO would show even greater dedication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric showed up at the office early in the morning, the employees were taken aback. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you at your wife&#39;s company today? Coming here so early, are you planning a special dinner for her tonight and need us to help with the preparations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cedric entered with a grim look on his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood at Phillips Group turned tense, fearing that their CEO was facing a setback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the company prepared for a potential crisis.Daniela arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary happily declared that the crisis had been resolved and escorted Daniela upstairs. &#34;It&#39;s been some time since your last visit. We&#39;ve all missed you.Your leadership at Phillips Group left a strong impression on everyone. We hope you&#39;ll visit more often to offer your guidance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, smiling, asked, &#34;How is Cedric&#39;s mood today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She aimed to assess the situation, following the strategy of understanding both herself and her opponent to ensure victory in any conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary replied, &#34;He might not have slept well.but it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&#34; To them, Daniela was highly respected, and the idea of her needing to calm anyone down seemed impossible. Daniela found the secretary&#39;s dramatic manner amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she went upstairs, Cedric was engaged in a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat outside the conference room with the thermos, and the secretary offered. &#34;Please wait here.I&#39;ll inform Mr.Phillips you&#39;re waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not in a rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a busy person, and it&#39;s rare for you to come by. Mr. Phillips is always tied up in meetings, and those attending could use a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the secretary hurried into the conference room, anxious not to keep Daniela waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door swung open, Cedric&#39;s expression grew even darker. It was clear he was in a foul mood, his face clouded with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary smiled brightly and said, &#34;Mr. Phillips.your wife is here and waiting by the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Cedric instantly turned his  head.</p>
