                <p>Alexander was gripped by a profound sense of regret as the charlty auction concluded all too early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t spent enough time with Daniela, and just like that, the event was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was left with an aching desire for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compelled by this longing, he trailed after Daniela into the cold evening air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was composing a message when a voice, rich and familiar, pierced the silence. &#34;Daniela.&#34; It was a voice that echoed with the timbre of Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised, she whirled around, her face erupting into a brilliant smile, her eyes dancing like celestial bodies under the grandeur of the street lamps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her, Alexander&#39;s heart warmed. &#34;Daniela.&#34; Disguised by his mask, he closed the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a graceful flourish of his hand, he directed the people behind him. &#34;Place these items in Daniela&#39;s trunk,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, her brows knitting together in displeasure, sauntered to the car&#39;s rear, her fingers deftly popping open the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at the man standing before her. His eyes were exactly like Cedric&#39;s. &#34;Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp sting of regret hit Alexander. As her voice called out his name, the radiance of her smile dimmed,slowly replaced by a curtain of cold detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Alexander&#39;s heart ached with a fervent wish to truly become Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to be the only Cedric in existence, the one who could draw out Daniela&#39;s smile so effortlessly and unguarded. Regrettably, he was not. Alexander pulled off the mask and gazed at Daniela,illuminated by the city&#39;s shimmering lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t need to be Alexander. I can be anyone you want me to be. I would traverse the farthest corners of the earth and do the most daring things if it meant making you happy. Daniela, you can&#39;t even imagine the depth of my love for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyebrows knitted together, her face shadowing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Lillian sensed something amiss. The man before them had worn Cedric&#39;s features, but an eerie coldness had radiated from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t waste your words on someone like him. Let&#39;s leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t spare Alexander a second glance as she turned to climb into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander made no move to follow her. Instead, he remained rooted to the spot, his lips curving into a gentle smile as he waved. &#34;Daniela, we&#39;ll see each other again very soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away, Lillian cast a sidelong glance at Daniela, her voice tinged with disbelief.&#34;What is he thinking? Who in their right mind undergoes plastic surgery to resemble Cedric? Is he mentally unstable,or simply out of his mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained stoically detached. She harbored no curiosity about Alexander&#39;s thoughts or underlying motives. Her heart harbored only two pursuits: seeking justice for her mother and standing by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spared no time for distractions, nor did she have any desire to engage with those who professed their love through bizarre and baffling actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning home, Daniela headed to her study. She retrieved the list Natalie had handed to her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to confront those individuals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux, renowned for its stable, robust maneuvers in the market, had recently shifted gears. It was now on an aggressive spree, seizing control of well-known domestic companies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Phillips Group quickly started to mimic these bold moves. From pharmaceuticals to education, from aviation to private banking, Elite Lux had spread its influence far and wide, leaving no sector untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The immense scale of their acquisitions stirred confusion and unease ämong the masses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s approach was merciless and unyielding. They gave no quarter, employing monopolistic practices that inevitably led their targets towards financial ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each acquisition was finalized at the shockingly nominal fee of one single dollar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The industry was in upheaval, with widespread anxiety about who could be next in line for Elite Lux&#39;s aggressive expansions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a frenzy, they frantically sought connections and leveraged every possible influence, desperate to understand what had driven Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux, to such extreme measures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some approached Richard, laden with lavish gifts, hoping to glean some understanding through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Richard&#39;s demeanor remained unaffected; his tone was smooth, his assurance palpable. &#34;Daniela has always possessed a serene disposition. For her to adopt such aggressive strategies, someone must have profoundly provoked her. There&#39;s no cause for alarm. If you&#39;ve conducted your affairs transparently, what reason is there to fear? Daniela isn&#39;t one to unjustly direct her frustrations at others. Return to your homes;don&#39;t fret over matters that are out of your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his soothing assurances, his visitors departed with lingering concern clearly etched upon their faces. Richard, in contrast, maintained a composed and detached air, seemingly unperturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, one unexpected day arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, a gentleman is at the door claiming to be the president of the National Commerce Association.He wishes to speak with you. He introduced himself as Mr.Perry.&#34;</p>
