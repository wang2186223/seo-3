                <p>Nikolas immediately turned to Daniela and said,&#34;Didn&#39;t you make me a promise that you&#39;d let my secretary come and take care of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes turned cold. &#34;I also warned you not to upset Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas turned around, casting a glance at Cedric.&#34;What exactly upset him? Daniela, you&#39;re spoiling him too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t Daniela supposed to have amnesia? Why was she still cared about Cedric so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t just kick me out!&#34; Nikolas was clearly flustered now. Living here was convenient,and leaving would throw all his plans into chaos.Besides, the vila was luxurious, and he loved it here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t give a damn about Nikolas&#39; protests. Nikolas glanced at Cedric and realized he couldn&#39;t rely on this hopeless romantic. He chased after Daniela, trying to negotiate with her. &#34;Come on, as Cedric&#39;s brother, I think I deserve a little respect and consideration from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he acknowledges you as a brother,then maybe.If he doesn&#39;t, then you&#39;re just some stranger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas protested, &#34;He never said I wasn&#39;t his brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gradually came to a stop, turning her head with a chilling gaze fixed on Nikolas, her eyes glinting with a clear, dangerous edge. &#34;What did you just say? Did you tell him he&#39;s from the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39;s eyes darted nervously. &#34;He figured it out on his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked skeptical as she asked, &#34;How did he figure it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t admit that he had sent Ghost to kill Cedric, only for the plan to backfire disastrously. That would make him look both vicious and incompetent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might&#39;ve accidentally slipped up during a phone call home, and he overheard. But what&#39;s with that look? The McCoy name is something people dream of. Why do you look so disgusted? You really think being a McCoy is shameful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas tried to go on the offensive, hoping to shift the focus away from himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela leveled a cold, unblinking stare at him,her voice low and threatening. &#34;If I find out you told him,you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned home with her dog, collected a suitcase from Tasha at the door, and hurled it outside without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut with a loud, deafening bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas flinched at the sound. After a long pause,he finally snapped, his anger boiling over. &#34;Who the hell does she think she is, throwing a tantrum like that? Fuming, Nikolas turned to Alexander, rolled his eyes dramatically, then turned his gaze to Cedric. &#34;Did you see Daniela&#39;s attitude? Unbelievable! Is this how she treats a McCoy? She threw my stuff out! Cedric,you&#39;re a man. Go in there and tell Daniela to stop giving me the cold shoulder, or you&#39;ll end things with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, clearly amused, as if he enjoyed indulging Daniela&#39;s arrogance. &#34;As long as she doesn&#39;t dump me, I don&#39;t have the heart to break up with her,&#34; he said, then turned and walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas planted his hands on his hips and seethed with anger as he spun around to unleash his frustration on Alexander. &#34;Alexander, look at this mess you&#39;ve created! You were always bragging about how close you were with Daniela. Well, she doesn&#39;t give a damn about you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Nikolas crouched, grabbed the luggage from the ground, and kicked the door open forcefully. Before entering, he warned Alexander, &#34;Don&#39;t follow me in! And don&#39;t come looking for me again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Nikolas headed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, his mind swirling with the flood of information that had just hit him all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had Nikolas just said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,who was a McCoy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was utterly incredulous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran through Alexander. He had just begun to feel a sense of superiority and started facing Cedric without the weight of his former inferiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Cedric suddenly turned into a McCoy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, he was Nikolas&#39; brother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was Hamilton&#39;s son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that mean Cedric had a legitimate claim to the McCoy family fortune? In other words, he could become the richest man in the world without even lifting a finger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood there, shell-shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder Daniela kept ignoring me, even after losing her memories. It&#39;s because of Cedric&#39;s identity,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Alexander had finally found a convenient excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he felt better, his emotions remained a tangled, unsettled mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric truly was Hamilton&#39;s son, how could he possibly compete with Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a wave of resentment washed over Alexander. He resented Richard for not being the richest man in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It now made sense why Cedric had shown little interest in the company&#39;s affairs. He must have seen these modest domestic ventures as beneath him. Alexander left the villa, a storm of conflicting emotions churning inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after his car had driven far off, he looked back at the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he truly destined to never be with Daniela in this lifetime?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to accept it!</p>
