                <p>Hamilton still seemed a bit lost. He muttered to himself, &#34;What lines? I told you-l was sending a text.1...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice faded as realization began to set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he snapped to attention, staring at Daniela like he could hardly believe what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric still held the test strip, his expression icy and unreadable as he looked at the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does anyone want to explain why you&#39;re all gathered in my house?&#34; he asked, barely masking his indifference. He then turned to Daniela. &#34;What does a positive result mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s cold demeanor melted away and a gentle smile tugged at her lips as she noticed the two lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked, caught off guard by the rush of happiness that swept over him. &#34;Is this a pregnancy test?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a careful nod. &#34;It is, but home tests aren&#39;t always reliable. We should visit the hospital and get a proper confirmation when we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>False results were not unheard of with these things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed caught up in his own happiness,unable to pull himself back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasted no time muscling his way forward.&#34;What are you waiting for, Cedric? Help her get comfortable. She shouldn&#39;t be standing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While giving instructions, Hamilton raised his voice toward the outside. &#34;Ralph! Get the supplements in.And call the housekeeping agency. I want their best nanny and nutritionist, and have them set up a full prenatal care facility right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement in Hamilton&#39;s voice only deepened the frowns on the rest of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Daniela&#39;s face. She couldn&#39;t quite grasp why Hamilton cared so much about her pregnancy. His overstepping felt unwarranted, if not a little presumptuous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leveling her gaze, Daniela remarked, &#34;We need to go to the hospital for a proper check-up to be sure, and don&#39;t bring those things into my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh interjected, &#34;Exactly. There&#39;s no way to trust a cheap little strip like that. Brad, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On cue, Brad quickly got his phone out and called in a team of doctors from his private clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wanted to avoid any surprises, and maybe make sure Daniela couldn&#39;t tamper with the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, a group of medical staff arrived,complete with equipment loaded on a massive truck,just to run a pregnancy test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her arms crossed, Carol remarked with exasperation, &#34;When it comes to flaunting their fortune, the McCoy family never fails to put on a show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she needed to be checked anyway, Daniela decided not to argue about where it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else clustered outside the exam room,nerves on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s jaw was set, his face etched with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s excitement had started to morph into tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, caught up in the storm of it all, looked even more unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old memories haunted him. There had been an unsolved bombing years back, and that wound had never truly healed. Discovering Daniela&#39;s pregnancy now felt overwhelming and bittersweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of Cedric pulled in different directions,caught between hope and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Daniela stepped out, her face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family surged forward, nearly tripping over each other to pepper the doctor with questions.&#34;Well? Is she really pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, the lab doctor looked caught off guard. He finally said, &#34;We&#39;ll need about thirty minutes to get the results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy tension gripped everyone all over again,each person feeling like their next breath was caught in their throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hovered by the doorway, jittery with impatience. He turned to Cedric with a frown. &#34;Stop just standing there. Help your wife get comfortable on the sofa. Are you planning to let my grandson suffer before he&#39;s even born?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That.left Cedric searching for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,too,found Hamilton&#39;s meddling hard to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His constant fussing only grated on their nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the scene, Josh sneered, &#34;You don&#39;t even know the outcome, but you&#39;re already acting like there&#39;s a baby boy on the way. Getting ahead of yourself, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton retorted with an exaggerated eye roll, &#34;Are you jealous because you&#39;ll just have to watch while l have a grandson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chimed in, &#34;Listen to yourself, Hamilton. You almost sound as rude as Daniela. Are you poking fun at us for not having grandsons yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules &#39;added, &#34;Seriously, you&#39;re going to feel pretty silly if the results show she&#39;s not pregnant at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the door,the lab staff could hear every word, and the weight of expectation only made them more nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intent on making sure there were no mistakes, Josh stepped into the lab and clamped a firm hand on the examiner&#39;s shoulder. His tone was calm but carried a clear edge of warning. &#34;Double-check everything.If you get this wrong, you&#39;ll answer to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear flickered in the examiner&#39;s eyes, and his hands trembled as he nearly fumbled his papers. With a strained grin, he tried to reassure them.&#34;Honestly, for early pregnancy, a blood test gives the clearest answer. The machines handle everything and generate the data automatically. There&#39;s really nothing for me to change or influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton asked, &#34;So, are you saying the equipment is reliable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to answer, the examiner nodded. &#34;No issues at all. This lab uses the latest technology. There&#39;s barely any human involvement, so the results will be accurate and trustworthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective breath eased out of the room after hearing the technician&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a satisfied nod. &#34;That&#39;s what I wanted to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot him a sharp look and responded, &#34;Are you implying we had mess with the results? Do you really think we&#39;d stoop that low?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive grunt, Hamilton replied,&#34;You never know. I lost my grandson once already, and I will do whatever it takes to keep this baby safe. Don&#39;t even think about interfering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh glared at the floor and muttered to himself, &#34;It&#39;s not my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the room simmered with tension as the family&#39;s powerful figures bickered and the examiner quietly hoped the results would come soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the report was finally ready. All eyes were glued to the single sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? What does it say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the pressure of everyone&#39;s anticipation, the examiner glanced down at the report and nodded slowly. &#34;Yes, she&#39;s pregnant. According to this, she&#39;s about one month along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence descended, filling every corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one moved or spoke. Hamilton&#39;s cheeks turned pink as delight washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the McCoy family, however, seemed to darken by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Josh asked with a hint of menace, &#34;How soon can you tell if it&#39;s a boy or a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The examiner flicked a nervous glance toward Hamilton, searching for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton dismissed it without missing a beat. &#34;That&#39;s none of your business. Go on and get out.She needs to rest.&#34;</p>
