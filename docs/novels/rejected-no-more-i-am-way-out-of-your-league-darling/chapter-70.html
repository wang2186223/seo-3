                <p>Cedric had initially intended to drive Daniela home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work, however, demanded his attention, and he stayed behind. When he finally wrapped up, a text from Ryan awaited him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a simple text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too slow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting a meeting, Cedric saw the message and replied with a question mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary was updating him on office affairs at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the fourth point, the secretary noticed Cedric&#39;s unusual inattentiveness-his typically diligent boss was distracted by his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing, the secretary doubted Cedric&#39;s focus and skipped an item on the list. Without looking up, Cedric pointed out, &#34;You skipped one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, the secretary apologized and readied to proceed, but Cedric, phone in hand, stood abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, accustomed to Cedric&#39;s steady presence, noted a rare unease in his demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared restless, bordering onanxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such descriptors were foreign when it came to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary halted, anticipating Cedric&#39;s next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Cedric dismissed him with a gesture. As the door shut, the secretary overheard Cedric&#39;s low query into the phone. &#34;Ryan, what exactly are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Ryan, weary from a night without sleep, was perched on a rooftop, nursing a drink. &#34;They mean exactly what you think. I just spotted Alexander&#39;s car tailing Daniela home. Cedric, what on earth are you up to? It&#39;s been forever, and you still haven&#39;t told her how you feel. Are you frightened or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, poised to knock, halted abruptly. Frightened? Who? Cedric? That couldn&#39;t be!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Cedric said, &#34;A bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s mouth hung open in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, caught off guard, pressed, &#34;Cedric, what scares you? You have it all-wealth, looks. What&#39;s there to fear? I just can&#39;t wrap my head around it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric slumped into his chair, his head lowered, his tone somber. &#34;You don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was flabbergasted. &#34;I don&#39;t get it? Or is it you who&#39;s missing the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exhaled deeply. &#34;She told me she&#39;s not ready for a relationship. Being away from her makes me restless, but getting too close... I worry it might push her away. I&#39;m walking on eggshells here. You don&#39;t understand her like I do. Push too hard, and she&#39;ll close off entirely.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan burst into laughter. &#34;Who would have imagined? The great Cedric Phillips, now so cautious and humble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared unfazed by the comment, shifting the topic. &#34;What was Alexander&#39;s business with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan snorted dismissively, &#34;What do you think? He wants her cooperation. He&#39;s angling for that North District project, but the way he clung to her in the footage-it looked off. Just a heads-up, Cedric. You should keep an eye out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression hardened, his response resolute. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Cedric postponed an early appointment to visit Daniela for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela descended the stairs to find Cedric contemplatively resting his chin on his hand at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed him curiously, then whispered to Josie, &#34;What&#39;s wth him today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie shrugged, clearly bemused. &#34;Beats me. He arrived early, took a seat, and hasn&#39;t uttered a single word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed, then shouted for Lillian to come down. Lillian appeared, yawning and complaining about her late night, her appetite absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela settled at the table, Cedric preemptively served her some side dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ate in measured silence, Cedric attentively topping up her plate with each bite she took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, her amusement nearly breaking through her poised demeanor as she continued to eat quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, Daniela dabbed her mouth with a napkin, then faced Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, visibly uncomfortable underher scrutiny, looked away and muttered, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, probing, &#34;You don&#39;t usually come over early to play host. Anything you&#39;re trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric cleared his throat awkwardly. &#34;Not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;Alright then, I&#39;m off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s suggestion of departure, Cedric quickly shed his guise of indifference, blurting out, &#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled and resumed her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric propped his chin on his hand, gazing earnestly at her. &#34;Let&#39;s have a conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela settled comfortably. &#34;Alright,let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric began tentatively, &#34;This year&#39;s economy hasn&#39;t been kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze. &#34;True, yet Phillips Group has just secured a significant deal. You&#39;re managing&#39;to expand, even amidst these challenges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused briefly, then confessed, &#34;However, collecting payments has been particularly tough lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her expression reflective. &#34;That&#39;s understandable. Yet, your company maintains robust cash flow. It&#39;s one of the few not dependent on borrowing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux was the other exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exhaled heavily. &#34;It&#39;s a tough season for business. Big deals are scarce, and the competition is fierce.My team is under so much pressure, they&#39;re turning to liquor to cope with the demands of networking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head, intuiting his implication, yet she simply smiled and began to respond, &#34;True,however-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t &#39;however&#39; me,&#34; Cedric cut in, raising his hand. &#34;If we continue this line of discussion...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d find himself without a leg to stand on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolving to be forthright, he stated, &#34;I&#39;m considering cuting corners. Phillips Group also specializes in architectural and renovation ventures. Why didn&#39;t Elite Lux consider us for the North District project? You shouldn&#39;t treat me differently just because we were classmates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric maintained eye contact, his tone softening. &#34;I&#39;m just asking for a fair chance.&#34;</p>
