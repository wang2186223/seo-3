            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been asleep for a long time, her body worn down by stress and the passionate sex with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally stirred, night had already fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,relentless rain hammered the roof,filling the world with a steady,rhythmic roar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft golden lamp glowed in the room, casting a gentle pool of light. The first thing Daniela saw was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sitting nearby, watching her quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut her eyes for a moment, then opened them again. &#34;I&#39;m hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Cedric&#39;s lips curved into a small,genuine smile. The icy edge that usually haunted his expression melted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped downstairs and soon returned with food.Daniela took a few slow bites, washed it down with water, and burrowed back under the blanket, letting the soothing sound of the rain lull her deeper into comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long while, she allowed herself to sink into silent reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric set the food aside and stretched out beside her,gently gathering Daniela into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As rain drummed steadily on the windows, Daniela patted his hand and murmured, &#34;I&#39;m alright now. You don&#39;t have to be sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed silent, but in the darkness, his eyes shimmered with unspoken emotion, the weight of everything pressing quietly on his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted, meeting his eyes before closing the distance and pressing her lips to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kiss this time brimmed with warmth and affection, a world apart from the desperate, almost self-sacrificing way they&#39;d clung to each other the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s touch was unhurried, his hands moving with careful reverence as if determined to let Daniela savor every second of closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their bodies finally stilled, the world outside had changed-the rain had faded into a tranquil hush.Sleep tugged at Daniela, and she drifted in and out of Cedric&#39;s arms, waking only to nibble a few more bites of food he offered her. Restlessness returned; she pushed herself upright,sitting cross-legged to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The position didn&#39;t last-Cedric reached for her,his arms looping around her waist and tugging her effortlessly against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let him, sprawling back with lazy abandon, then broke the silence with a soft question. &#34;When did you find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric understood instantly-she meant her aversion to blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;I used to rely on tranquilizer, so most people never picked up on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric simply answered, &#34;A long time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head as she pressed on. &#34;How long ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back when you were still chasing Alexander.One night at a bar, you went to get him a drink.Someone near the counter had blood on their mouth.You saw it,hesitated for a second, and left as quickly as you could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked in surprise. &#34;Then you found out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory was vague-just a flash of red at someone&#39;s lips, hardly enough to notice,and she&#39;d hidden any reaction beneath a calm exterior. Only Carol and a handful of trusted friends even knew about her phobia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always been careful, always kept her guard up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. After that, I made sure to steer clear of any red dishes when I cooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned on Daniela. &#34;So that&#39;s why Carol kept begging you to make spicy food, and you always refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, tightening his arms around her.&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Your fear of blood isn&#39;t a flaw. With me here,no one will ever use it against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reassurance eased her, and she smiled,chatting with him quietly until sleepiness pulled at her eyelids again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gently coaxed her to rest, tucking her snugly beneath the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gathered the half-finished meal, ready to take it downstairs, when a small hand slipped from beneath the blanket and caught his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was barely above a whisper, her features softened by the warm glow of the bedside lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused, his expression gentle. &#34;I&#39;m just clearing these up. I&#39;ll be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers loosened, and she nodded. After a moment, she murmured, &#34;Don&#39;t blame Nikolas and Damon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened, but he didn&#39;t argue. He simply brushed a loose strand of hair from her forehead and said,&#34;Alright. Rest now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night dragged on,quiet and slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in Cedric&#39;s arms, Daniela slept more soundly than she had in a long time, soothed by the warmth of his steady heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she stirred, pale daylight was already spilling through the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was across the room, moving his things upstairs with an efficiency that made it look effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched him, her voice a bit hoarse when she spoke. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused and glanced over his shoulder, a faint smile playing at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doubted Daniela realized it herself, but every time she spoke in that soft, sleepy tone, it made her sound impossibly sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung his shirts in the wardrobe beside hers,  arranging his jackets and setting their shoes side by side. &#34;We&#39;re married, aren&#39;t we? It only makes sense that our things go together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied him, amused. &#34;So you&#39;re moving in for good? Sharing my bed every night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met her gaze, his tone casual and absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. We&#39;re husband and wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no argument in her. Daniela stretched her arm out from beneath the blanket, a sly grin curving her lips. &#34;Well then, help me find something to wear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took the most comfortable home clothes from the wardrobe and handed them to Daniela. &#34;From now on,I&#39;ll handle these little things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she dressed, her voice muffled behind a curtain of fabric, she asked, &#34;So what&#39;s left for me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head popped through the neckline just as Cedric closed the distance, his hand gentle on her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips to hers-a kiss meant to be brief,but desire made him linger, stealing her breath and coaxing a soft laugh from her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he finally let her go did he answer, &#34;All you need to do is let me spoil you with kisses.&#34;</p>
