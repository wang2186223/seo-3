                <p>That evening, Alexander was at home. In his study,a partition still divided the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Hackett didn&#39;t argue about it like before. He was already backed into a corner, with the public turning against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the association members were keeping their distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to fight back, and hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, please, you have to help me! That recording going around online is a complete lie!Cedric fabricated the whole thing-I had nothing to do with it. Cedric is ruthless! He showed up at my family,and all I did was introduce my daughter to him. That&#39;s it! But now he&#39;s twisting everything. The worst part?I never even said those things! It&#39;s all slander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the partition, Alexander sat at his desk,leisurely pouring himself a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, sweating, glanced to the partition, trying to push past it, but the bodyguards stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped a shaky hand across his forehead. &#34;Alexander, if you help me get through this, consider it a favor you can cash in anytime. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched between them, until a soft,mocking chuckle drifted from the other side of the partition.&#34;You can barely keep yourself afloat right now.What makes you think your favor is worth anything to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s jaw clenched. He pulled a check from his pocket and held it up. &#34;This is just a small token of my gratitude. Once this whole mess is taken care of,l promise you&#39;ll be repaid tenfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard carried the check over to Alexander,who barely spared it a glance. &#34;I need you to agree to one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s pulse stuttered. &#34;What condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice was smooth but unyielding. &#34;Once this crisis is over, you&#39;ll resign from the association,and I&#39;ll take over as president.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s forced smile twitched. His original plan had been to let Alexander take the role temporarily, only to rally the other seven members and force him out once the dust settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave him no time to dwell on it. &#34;The other seven must step down with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s fingers curled into fists. This wasn&#39;t just a minor concession-this was handing over an empire he had spent years cultivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew in a sharp breath, barely masking his frustration. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re asking for too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, he had ruled over the association,overseeing annual revenues that exceeded a million dollars under normal circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now Alexander expected him to give it up just like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s tone remained indifferent. &#34;Have you not grasped the situation yet? Daniela is coming for you and the others. I may not know the full story, but based on what I do know, there&#39;s only one reason she would go to such lengths.Brylee&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Alexander delivered his next words with unwavering certainty. &#34;You were involved in Brylee&#39;s death. That&#39;s why Daniela wants revenge. Do you really think your association is worth more than a human life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Of course! My association is my life&#39;s work! No one&#39;s life-especially not Brylee&#39;s -compares to it!&#34; Alexander exhaled lightly, almost amused. Then you&#39;d better think carefully. You&#39;ve seen what Daniela is capable of. Would you rather end up with nothing? Or lose the association but keep Graves Group intact?Take your time deciding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s gaze darkened with suppressed rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned back in his chair, his voice steady.&#34;The first twenty-four hours in PR are critical. You don&#39;t need me toremind you of that, do you? If you don&#39;t mae a decision now, I won&#39;t be able to pull you out of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett stood stiffly, his fists clenching at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice shook with barely contained fury-losing the association felt like tearing away a piece of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander&#39;s composed demeanor made one thing painfully clear: he had no other options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long silence stretched between them before Hackett finally spat out, &#34;Fine! But I have one condition. I want Cedric dead. I want Daniela to lose the man she loves forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the partition, Alexander&#39;s lips curled into a slow,calculated smile. &#34;As you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the agreement was signed, Hackett&#39;s voice turned cold. &#34;Now tell me-how do we fight back?&#34; Alexander let out a low, mirthless chuckle. &#34;Cedric released a recording that painted you as someone who disrespects women. You&#39;ll counter with footage of Cedric drinking, getting cozy with your three daughters, and later, entering a hotel with them. After that,you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped, every syllable laced with a quiet,lethal intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s lips curled into a sinister grin as he listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander,you really are a master at manipulating public perception. I won&#39;t deny that your plan could throw Cedric intodeep trouble. But the person in the video must be Cedric himself. If the footage is unclear,it won&#39;t hold up. Besides, Cedric isn&#39;t an idiot -he won&#39;t give us the chance to frame him. We could end up facing serious charges for falsifying evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let a beat of silence pass before drawing out his response.&#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett nodded firmly, his confidence unwavering.&#34;Of course. Do you think Phillips Group&#39;s PR team is weak? They&#39;ll scrutinize every second of that video,tearing it apart for inconsistencies. If Cedric himself isn&#39;t clearly visible, the whole plan is useless.I can&#39;t back this strategy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were polite, but his expression made his  opinion clear-Alexander&#39;s idea was ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then make sure Cedric appears in the footage.&#34;Alexander&#39;s response was cold and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; HHackett&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief.&#34;Alexander, you can&#39;t be serious! How the hell would Cedric ever cooperate with me? Have you not seen how obsessed he and Daniela are with each other?They&#39;re practically glued at the hip! No one could ever come between them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration twisted in his chest, and he felt like he was wasting his breath trying to reason with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to rise from his seat in exasperation, the bodyguards stepped forward,gripping the parttion on both sides and removing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the room, Alexander sat composed,his presence commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s breath hitched as their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,Alexander lifted his gaze and asked, &#34;What if I play the role of Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
            </div>
