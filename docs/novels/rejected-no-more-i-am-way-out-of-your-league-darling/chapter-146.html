                <p>&#34;I must see Daniela now!&#34; Caiden insisted fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies, sir, but it&#39;s the middle of the night. Ms.Harper has already retired for the evening. If this is urgent, I&#39;d suggest returning at a more suitable hour,&#34;said the security guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina edged closer to Caiden. &#34;Every moment we delay puts the child at greater risk. Remember what Alexander told us? Daniela and Cedric assaulted him when he tried to get the medicine for the child. It&#39;s obvious Daniela is deliberately avoiding you. This child is your future-your pillar in old age. It seems Daniela doesn&#39;t want you having anyone to lean on later in life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s temper exploded instantly at those words. He fixed a fierce glare on the security guard. &#34;Do you have any idea who I am? I&#39;m your boss&#39;s father, for fuck&#39;s sake! Without me, there&#39;s no Daniela, no building,and no shit for you to guard! Now get the hell out of my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard remained unyielding. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry, sir.However, these are not visiting hours. If you genuinely are Ms. Harper&#39;s father, perhaps you could call her?&#34; &#34;I am her father!&#34; Caiden&#39;s words came out in a rush,and for a moment, he almost let slip that he didn&#39;t have her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing his arm, Katrina shot him a cautionary look.She then turned to the guard, her expression melting into a persuasive smile. &#34;We truly are Daniela&#39;s family.We came in such a rush we forgot our phones at home.Could we perhaps use your phone? We know her private number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard eyed them suspiciously, uncertainty flickering across his face. He hesitated briefly before reaching for his phone. Yet, before his fingers could grasp it,Lillian came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard greeted her with respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gaze sharpened upon seeing the visibly agitated Caiden and Katrina waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They claim they&#39;re Ms. Harper&#39;s parents,&#34; the guard informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian snorted derisively, her arms crossed as she faced Caiden. &#34;Oh, so now you&#39;re her parents? Didn&#39;t you cut ties with her? What,you suddenly forgot your own bullshit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face darkened with fury. &#34;Quit screwing around. Bring Daniela here before I lose my patience.&#34;Unmoved, Lillian yawned, signaling her disinterest.&#34;She&#39;s resting. If you have something important, I&#39;m here to listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden spat, &#34;Talking to you is pointless! You don&#39;t call the shots! Drag Daniela&#39;s ass down here immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive laugh, Lillian countered, &#34;You can say it or not, the choice is yours. But at this late hour,I&#39;m the one you&#39;re dealing with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Katrina gave Caiden a gentle push and murmured, &#34;Just tell her. She&#39;s working for Daniela,isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden cast a quick glance at Katrina before refocusing on Lillian. &#34;Look, it&#39;s clear Daniela runs Dreamscape, and your lab has concocted some groundbreaking heart repair tech. I need one of those miracle pills. If you&#39;ve got the authority, pass it here and spare me a trip to Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; Katrina, previously jittery, now exuded a calm demeanor as she observed Caiden&#39;s escalating frustration. She offered Lillian a sly smile and queried,&#34;Can you make that decision, or should we have Daniela come down here? Of course, if you&#39;re not inclined to help us, we&#39;re more than willing to purchase it. It would be interesting to see if Daniela still values family ties or if she&#39;s lost touch with her origins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gaze sharpened, her mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized that meddling in Daniela&#39;s familial conflicts was beyond her role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of mishandling the delicate matter and complicating things for Daniela filled her with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the urge to wipe that smug expression off Katrina&#39;s face was almost overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other recourse, Lillian texted Daniela,receiving no immediate response. After a tense pause,she dialed Daniela&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone barely completed one ring before Daniela picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina perched on her tiptoes, straining to catch a snippet of Daniela&#39;s conversation, but her words remained elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Caiden paced, a mask of impatience and concern etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whirling around, Katrina faced the security guard and flashed a knowing smirk. &#34;See? I was right. We&#39;re still her family. Your earlier display of authority was quite over the top, don&#39;t you think? To an outsider, it might even appear as though you owned the place!&#34; The guard&#39;s jaw tightened as he fought to keep his composure under her taunts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed, Katrina&#39;s sneer deepened. &#34;It&#39;s just the way things are, isn&#39;t it? Some folks, like you, draw the short straw-destined for a badge and a uniform.Meanwhile, we&#39;re cut from a different cloth, born to bask in the lap of luxury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden echoed her disdain with a derisive look towards the guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard, biting back his retort, knew better than to engage. After all, the pair had introduced themselves as the president&#39;s parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lillian hung up and faced them with a composed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina straightened with an air of authority, fully prepared to storm in. But just as she moved, Lillian&#39;s hand shot up, stopping her in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smug expression evaporated, her features contorting into a scowl of rage. &#34;What is the meaning of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our boss was very clear. Everyone is te master of their own fate, and she refuses to meddle in someone else&#39;s destiny. It&#39;s best if you leave now.&#34; She then turned to address the security guard. &#34;And just so you know, the boss wanted me to inform you -she considers herself without parents now. Handle this as you deem appropriate. If they become troublesome, don&#39;t hesitate to call the police. You&#39;re an Elite Lux employee, empowered to reject unwelcome visitors. There&#39;s a $10,000 bonus for your discretion. Stop by the finance department tomorrow to claim it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stretch that betrayed a hint of nonchalance,Lillian sauntered off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Katrina were left rooted to the spot, their eyes locked on the closing doors of the elevator as Lillian disappeared from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just walked away? Was Daniela really going to let them suffer without giving a shit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to concede, Katrina took a determined step forward, only to be met by the security guard, who now brandished his baton with an authoritative grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Elite Lux, not an open house,&#34; he stated icily,blocking their path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stance underscored his formidable presence,and the palpable tension caused Katrina to falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina begrudgingly retreated toward the entrance. As they stood in the chilling gusts of wind, she turned to Caiden, worry etching her face. &#34;What do we do now?&#34;</p>
