                <p>Cedric and Daniela couldn&#39;t have been more different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifference was absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking,she focused on her meal, completely ignoring Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even his role as the president of the commerce association influenced her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even bother with a few concluding remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Hackett sat on pins and needles,embarrassment nibbling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela had left, without so much as a glance backward, that Hackett&#39;s face hardened. He rose,his expression cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surrounding diners, familiar with Hackett, were visibly shocked. They had always seen him as a commanding figure,yet here he was, diminished by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett seemed so powerful before!&#34; &#34;Absolutely. At a recent auction, after he was outbid on something he wanted, the winner ended up with a broken leg. Everyone thought Hackett was untouchable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s surprising to see him outmaneuvered by a young woman like Daniela, given his experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at him, drenched in a cold sweat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But shouldn&#39;t all eight association members be here?What is Hackett here alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He must be trying to secure Daniela&#39;s mercy behind closed doors while boasting about his influence in public. Knowing Daniela, she won&#39;t bother to set the record straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they talked, they captured Hackett&#39;s stern visage and shared the images online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Hackett could barely contain his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long time since he had been so humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened up and strode out of the Elite Lux dining hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he walked away, the echoes of laughter followed him. &#34;Look at him! Nothing but empty threats. We all know he&#39;s lost his edge. It&#39;s about time he stepped aside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hackett entered the elevator, his face contorted with fury, and he slammed his fist against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With renewed resolve, he vowed to bring down Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett rushed to the commerce association and summoned the other seven members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the phone, he insisted they assemble urgently within half an hour to plan their counterattack against Daniela&#39;s economic measures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he paced, hands clenched on his hips, his anger intensified, fantasies of retribution against Daniela occupying his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his demands, thirty minutes ticked by without any of the members appearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun dipped below the horizon, and only then did Bruno walk in, unfazed by his tardiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What seems to be the problem?&#34; Hackett snapped,losing any semblance of calm. &#34;Bruno, weren&#39;t we supposed to address a crucial issue today? Why the indifference? Am I the only one facing these sanctions? Don&#39;t you care about your enterprise anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, Bruno dragged over a chair and settled  into it with a sigh of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, the rest began to appear, with Winslow being the last to arrive, well after ten in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a yawn, Winslow asked, &#34;I&#39;ve got plans later.Can we get this over with in thirty minutes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing firmly, hands still on his hips, Hackett stared at them with cold contempt. &#34;What&#39;s this supposed to mean? Are you telling me you can&#39;t even manage to gather everyone for a meeting now? Am I the only active member here? If that&#39;s your attitude, we might as well dissolve this association!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage simmered within Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, wearing a grim expression, confronted him.&#34;Hackett, who are you trying to deceive? You think we&#39;re oblivious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Hackett asked, &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, what are you implying?&#34; Farley asked in a sharp tone. &#34;Did you secretly meet with Daniela to beg for mercy? Hoping she would spare you? Hackett,should I play the recording where you malign her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s voice wavered as his lips tightened. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, visibly annoyed, flung his phone towards him.&#34;Take a look! You met with Daniela earlier today,right?  It&#39;s all over the internet. We never thought you&#39;d deceive us like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A noticeable shock ran through Hackett. Yet,he soon regained his composure and raised his voice. &#34;Now you&#39;re accusing me? Who was I trying to protect? Do you think I enjoyed degrading myself before Daniela?What drove me to do it? If I weren&#39;t president, I would prefer to avoid this mess. I couldn&#39;t bear to see you end up like Bruno and Huey, so I went to beg Daniela to spare everyone. Was it your assumption that l pleaded only for my own sake? Had I realized this misunderstanding, I would&#39;ve indeed pleaded solely for myself.How utterly thankless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face, round and flushed,quivered with what seemed to be genuine resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused looks were exchanged among the group,with none able to discern Hackett&#39;s honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Firmly, Hackett continued, &#34;Daniela now wields considerable influence. Without solidarity, she&#39;ll overshadow us. Do you really want that to happen?This association has thrived for years, benefitting everyone. If you&#39;re ready to surrender and let a woman like Daniela command you, then I wash my hands of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk playing on his lips, Hackett eyed their grave expressions. &#34;Let me clarify something else.Daniela&#39;s leniency won&#39;t extend to you simply because  you submit. Do you think she&#39;s after you for your business dealings? False! That&#39;s utterly false! This is all about Brylee&#39;s death!&#34;</p>
