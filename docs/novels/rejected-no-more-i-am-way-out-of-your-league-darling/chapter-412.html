                <p>The following day, Daniela stayed home from work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was organizing the CEO&#39;s office, observing indifferently as Linden lingered around Natalie,constantly calling her &#34;sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at Nina&#39;s lips as she watched the unfolding scene in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All morning, Natalie shot desperate looks at Nina,silently begging for help. But Nina stayed indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By noon, Elyse showed up and tugged Nina aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse reprimanded her. &#34;Natalie&#39;s been looking at you all morning, pleading for help, and you act like you don&#39;t see it. Are you blind? Didn&#39;t you notice that jerk trying to take advantage of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina continued wiping the table with calm indifference.&#34;Is that so?&#34; Elyse&#39;s anger flared up. She placed her hands on her hips, her words laced with fury. &#34;Really, Nina? What happened to you? That&#39;s your sister! Look at Linden all over her, and you don&#39;t even think about stepping in? What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave a bitter laugh, throwing Elyse a cold look as she tossed the cloth aside. &#34;Oh, I&#39;d love to know what&#39;s wrong with me, too. You had no issue sending me to Linden&#39;s bed, but now you can&#39;t stand him bothering my sister? Am I worth less than her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Elyse showed no sign of guilt.She quickly checked to ensure no one was around before retorting, &#34;Why are you raising your voice like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had expected Elyse to feel some guilt for treating her virginity as a mere transaction. Instead,Elyse pressed on, &#34;Are you out of your mind? If Linden finds out it wasn&#39;t Natalie that night, what happens then? Nina, can&#39;t you consider your sister for once? She&#39;s fought so hard to get to where she is now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s fury erupted, and she let out a sharp, bitter laugh. &#34;Oh, sure, Natalie&#39;s had it hard. Meanwhile,I&#39;ve got it easy. Everything&#39;s about her. Even handing me off to some guy just for her benefit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Natalie finally broke free from Linden and walked over just in time to hear Nina&#39;s words. She gave Nina a look of contempt. &#34;Seriously,Nina? You&#39;re still holding on to this? How many times are you going to bring up spending the night with Linden? What, didn&#39;t you enjoy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes began to fill with tears. She let out a cold laugh and shot back, &#34;Oh, really? Then why don&#39;t you go sleep with him yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was haunted by nightmares from that night.Just thinking about nearly being violated by Linden made her stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hadn&#39;t slept properly in days, dark circles under her eyes, but Natalie just brushed it off as nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to keep her emotions in check, Nina lunged at Natalie, but Elyse quickly slapped her across the face. The slap left Nina in shock, her tears welling up and falling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through her blurred vision, Nina could only see the disdain on Elyse&#39;s face and the mockery in Natalie&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their eyes, she was nothing but worthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite the scene to start the day,&#34; Daniela remarked,standing in the doorway, observing Nina pressed against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly wiped the cruel expression from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse flashed a smile. &#34;Daniela, I thought you weren&#39;t coming to the office today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela strolled over and sat down in the CEO&#39;s chair,her eyes flicking to Nina&#39;s swollen face. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly moved forward, dismissing it. &#34;She&#39;s just being dramatic. I gave her a small lesson.Nothing to worry about.&#34; Natalie added, &#34;Nina can be a bit clumsy. The guests at Elite Lux are important, and I&#39;m worried she won&#39;t meet their standards. I was thinking my mother could take her back to Harper Group so you don&#39;t have to deal with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had to make sure Daniela never found out about the pastries being tampered with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, Nina was too naive to remain around Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes.&#34; Elyse reached for Nina&#39;s hand, trying to pull her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to Harper Group!&#34; Nina cried out,realizing their plan. They were scared thetruth would come out or Linden would find out the person with him that night wasn&#39;t Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina felt the sting of abandonment once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s insatiable desires meant that if she didn&#39;t escape, sooner or later, she&#39;d be back in his bed. &#34;Daniela, I won&#39;t leave. I want to stay at Elite Lux!Please, let me stay here. I&#39;ll do whatever you need!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse gritted her teeth, starting to drag Nina by force towards the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gripped the doorframe, tears streaming down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Nina holding on, Natalie raised her stiletto heel, clearly intending to bring it down hard on Nina&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People might think you&#39;re the CEO of Elite Lux,Auntie,&#34; Daniela remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room froze and turned in disbelief,their eyes locking onto Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in her chair, her small smile slowly fading.Fixing Elyse with a steady gaze, she continued, &#34;ls the personnel management at Elite Lux now your responsibility?&#34;</p>
