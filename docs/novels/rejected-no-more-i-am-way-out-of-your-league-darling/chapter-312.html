                <p>Daniela lifted her shirt as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deeper grew the night outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the table, a glass perched precariously shook, causing subtle ripples to dance on the water within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Low whimpers echoed through the room, stretching the night into an endless void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day dawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric awoke, his spirit completely rejuvenated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snuggling close to Daniela, he admired the gentle curve of her lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A profound sense of relief swelled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of an almost surreal thought lingered in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was lost in a deep sleep, dreaming of a comforting warmth pressing against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the warmth turned stifling, she shifted, only to feel it persist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hot breath against her skin then dragged her back into a suffocating sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-asleep, she caught Cedric&#39;s low chuckle as he murmured, &#34;Once I completely owned you, I never want to let go of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slept on, undisturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric went downstairs to cook for Daniela when Caiden returned from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you need to pay up. I can&#39;t shoulder these hospital bills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In loose white loungewear, Cedric watched the soupsimmer. Caiden, fraught with anxiety, inquired, &#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In her room,&#34; Cedric replied calmly. &#34;But I advise against going up there right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden paused on the stairs upon hearing that. &#34;Why don&#39;t you pay the bills then? I&#39;s only thirty grand, a mere slice of your bank balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Content, Cedric responded lightly, &#34;I don&#39;t control my finances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who does?&#34; Caiden blurted out, realizing his question&#39;s futility afterward. He groaned in frustration.&#34;You&#39;re content not controlling your money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s assured demeanor might lead one to think he let Daniela manage his finances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just dating, yet she already controls your money?&#34; Reconsidering, Caiden chose not to ascend the stairs. Instead, he attempted to reason with Cedric. &#34;Listen, every man should have some accessible cash.You&#39;re not even married to Daniela yet. If she wants to control your finances, you can refuse. Besides, with your business, surely you&#39;ve got some reserves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded, &#34;No, there&#39;s only about ten dollars left in my account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous night, while embracing Daniela, he had transferred all his funds into her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He subscribed to the belief that a true man, once married, should relinquish financial control, living modestly under his partner&#39;s vigilant supervision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was baffled by the joy evident on Cedric&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;re a CEO and you&#39;re down to ten bucks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gestured towards the phone on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching, Caiden peered at the screen and saw the balance was a mere cent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even ten dollars!&#34; Caiden gasped in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at the display. &#34;Looks like they charged a fee. I&#39;ll need to ask Daniela for lunch money later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s astonishment grew. &#34;Billions at your disposal, and you can&#39;t even afford lunch? Does Daniela really control your finances that tightly?&#34; Cedric simply smiled. &#34;Yes, she&#39;s quite strict.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,observing Cedric&#39;s increasingly satisfied expression, clicked his tongue twice. Despite his concerns for Cedric&#39;s well-being, a sense of solidarity emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would Daniela cover Joyce&#39;s hospital expenses if I asked? She must, right? Saving is tough on my budget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then showed Cedric the paltry sum in his account. &#34;This is all that&#39;s left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, while serving soup, nodded. &#34;Ask her, if you feel bold enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated, wishing Cedric would offer to ask instead. Noting Cedric&#39;s passive compliance as he carried soup upstairs, Caiden abandoned the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;&#34;Forget about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized that Cedric&#39;s predicament might be more severe than his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunate man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela nestled within Cedric&#39;s hold, briefly awoke to sip some soup before drifting back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As darkness enveloped the outside, she stirred once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her eyes slowly, she noticed Cedric sitting quietly beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter greeted her awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned away from him, her eyes closing once more. &#34;I&#39;m done with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,sitting on the bed&#39;s edge like a devoted dog, panicked slightly.&#34;What?Why not?&#34;-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carefully turned Daniela to face him. &#34;Didn&#39;t you like it? Wasn&#39;t it enjoyable?&#34;</p>
