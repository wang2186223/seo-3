                <p>With an IV hooked to his arm, Hamilton sat in the hospital room, his face clouded with irritation. &#34;Where did I go so wrong that I raised a son this embarrassingly incompetent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, on the other hand, remained perfectly composed. &#34;Isn&#39;t that a bit much, Father? Sure, I didn&#39;t juggle everything flawlessly today, but does it really call for this kind of theatrics? The McCoy family isn&#39;t about to topple from grace over a headline or two.The buzz will die down before you know it. Who&#39;s going to care in a week? We&#39;ll throw some cash at a few celebrities to clean up our image, and profits will roll in like clockwork. The McCoy family still has the food industry in Oiscoll wrapped around their finger So what&#39;s got you shaking in your boots? Don&#39;t tell me age is finally turning you into a spineless old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes burned with barely restrained rage &#34;What the hell did you just say? You think empires fall overnight? No! They rot from the inside, one careless crack at a time. Reputation makes or breaks a business, and you toss it aside like some worthless scrap? It&#39;s obvious now-you don&#39;t have what it takes to lead McCoy Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had tried to keep his fury in check, but that final insult tore through his self-control like a blade.&#34;I&#39;m never good enough for you, am l? No matter what I do, I&#39;ll always fall short! So tell me,why did you even bother having a son like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s hand cracked across his face,the sound sharp and final. His eyes burned with contempt.&#34;All it takes is one stumble for you to fall apart? You&#39;re proving my point-you&#39;re nowhere near ready to lead Get out. Come back when you&#39;ve cooled that reckless head of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Nikolas turned on his heel and stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he was outside, he pulled out his phone and dialed the food department of McCoy Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stick to the plan!&#34; he snapped. &#34;No exceptions! lf anyone from Daniela&#39;s side places an order, swNap their meals with tainted ones. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other end of the line went dead quiet. After a tense pause, a reluctant voice finally responded, &#34;Sir,we just got word from the headquarters. Your father pulled your credentials. You&#39;ve been stripped of your role as manager. You&#39;re no longer in charge of the food department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor ran through him as he turned, stiff and disbelieving, to face the villa once more. His father had actually yanked his position away? All because of that? Something so petty,so insignificant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it-his father saw him as nothing more than a backup, a replaceable pawn to be discarded at will?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; vision blurred with rage, his breath sharp and erratic as fury surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make you eat those words,&#34; he hissed through clenched teeth. &#34;You&#39;ll regret ever doubting me. I&#39;m the rightful heir of the McCoy family, and I&#39;ll prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, he hunted down the food department&#39;s management. &#34;My father&#39;s legacy is ending. I&#39;m the one shaping the future of McCoy Group. Stand with me now, or don&#39;t bother showing up when the tides turn. You know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela was reviewing construction budgets when a large delivery of food boxes arrived at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up to investigate. The delivery man glanced at his clipboard and said, &#34;Cedric Phillips placed the order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric?&#34; Her brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t the type to bother with logistics like this. The delivery man fidgeted under her gaze, and the unease in Daniela&#39;s chest deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could press him further, a voice called out from the entryway. She turned to see Nikolas approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, got a minute?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast one last look at the stack of food boxes,then addressed the delivery man firmly. &#34;Hold off on bringing anything upstairs. I want to see the order receipt first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she pivoted on her heel and strode toward Nikolas, her expression tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she neared him, she cast one last look over her shoulder. The delivery man was definitely digging through his phone for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she faced Nikolas. &#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing big. Just thought we should have a quick word,&#34; he replied with an easy shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his gaze slid past her, landing on the delivery man in a subtle cue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching it, the delivery man gave a small nod before murmuring to his partner, &#34;Move.&#34;</p>
