                <p>The echo of Joyce&#39;s laughter was gone,replaced by stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Alexander, pulling on his sleeve.&#34;Alexander,surely you don&#39;t believe this nonsense, do you? This is Daniela we&#39;re discussing-the same woman who has adored you for over a decade! How can she suddenly be the CEO of Elite Lux? Does she even possess the resources or the capacity to achieve something like this? Take a good look! We&#39;re standing in the iconic building of Olisvine-a genuine landmark!How could Daniela, of all people, manage to own such a place? Alexander, it&#39;s impossible that she&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux. Don&#39;t be deceived by her!&#34; Daniela had spent more than twenty years playing the flawless role of the Harper family&#39;s heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the samne duration, Joyce had existed under her shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was renowned for her beauty, grace, and intellect-attributes that allowed her to shine in whatever she pursued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? She was supposed to have tumbled from grace, shamed by the Bennett family. Yet here she stood, bathed in the illustrious aura of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Joyce ever come to terms with this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander faced Daniela. Unlike Joyce, he maintained his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the revelation had stirred him, he couldn&#39;t ignore the undeniable reality before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had reality been different, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have been able to set foot inside this establishment,let alone receive a cordial welcome from Joshua and the building manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile graced Daniela&#39;s lipsas she stood there,and Alexander found the expression rather disconcerting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gazed at her, his voice tinged with confusion and a hint of accusation. &#34;If you&#39;re really the CEO of Elite Lux, why keep that a secret until now? Did you find amusement in this charade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was her pretense of vulnerability merely a ploy to garner his compassion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a sly schemer she was.	~ As these thoughts swirled in his mind, an old memory bubbled up to the surface. Richard had mentioned that the CEO of Elite Lux had first become a prominent figure while still a teenager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the release of her lauded final work,&#34;Unrequited Love,&#34; she had abruptly receded from the limelight. The whispers at the time had been tantalizing; many believed this young visionary had been struck by a real-life romance, choosing love over her career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, if Daniela indeed was that CEO, had she relinquished her role at Elite Lux for the sake of a heartfelt affection? And more intriguingly, who was the person that swayed her heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing apart, Alexander observed Daniela with a bewildering sense of estrangement cloaking him. For the first time, it dawned on him that perhaps he had never truly known her.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled by Alexander&#39;s intense scrutiny, Daniela offered a slight, enigmatic smile and responded, &#34;It appears you&#39;ve forgotten. You&#39;ve always been too engrossed in your own affairs to allow me a moment to clarify, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Daniela had intended to unveil all her secrets to Alexander before their impending nuptials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Alexander had told her that he had no interest in her and all he wanted was for her to behave herself after their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In simpler terms, he held no real expectations of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the public, Alexander&#39;s father had even stated that the union was simply a long-standing commitment made between the two families years earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, beneath this facade lay a more strategic calculation. The Bennett family had consented to the marriage solely due to the considerable influence wielded by the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,being Caiden&#39;s only biological daughter, stood to inherit a substantial portion of the Harper family&#39;s fortune, despite Caiden having remarried and having a stepdaughter. Given these prospects, the Bennett family welcomed her into their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon discovering the true motives behind their acceptance, Daniela&#39;s eagerness to disclose her true self dwindled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened dramatically, his jaw tightening as his eyes became turbulent with frustration. Underneath lay a palpable fury,fueled by the bitter realization that he had been deceived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steely glare at Joyce, he declared in a frosty tone, &#34;We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining would only tarnish the honor of their  families further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they neared the exit, Lillian&#39;s commanding voice stopped them in their tracks. &#34;Hold on a moment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Alexander paused, his body tensed as Lillian strode forward, a golf club in hand. &#34;Here,take your $8,000 golf club. I doubt even our caddies would bother with such an inferior piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mocking words cut deep, visibly embarrassing Joshua,who turned a deep shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurriedly pressed the elevator button and ushered Alexander and Joyce out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela made her triumphant return to Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the CEO of Elite Lux, she now presided majestically over Olisvine&#39;s most famous landmark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recovering from her astonishment, Joyce was already weaving new plots. She leaned towards Caiden, her voice oozing sugary charm. &#34;Dad, Daniela&#39;s now the CEO of Elite Lux and she owns Olisvine&#39;s top landmark building. Do you think you could convince her to spare one floor for me?&#34;</p>
