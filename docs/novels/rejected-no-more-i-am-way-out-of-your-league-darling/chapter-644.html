                <p>Joyce stepped to the side, casting a glance at Jack,who was still kneeling on the ground.&#34;Go ahead,keep crying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been in the meeting all morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the meeting concluded, her secretary was pacing nervously by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, you&#39;re finally out. There&#39;s a crowd downstairs-press included.The spectacle even hit the viral news this morning; the roads nearby are completely jammed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the phone her secretary offered, Daniela scrolled through the buzzing headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really true that Daniela can&#39;t have a baby of her own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any room for doubt? Just look. Her nephew is already staking claim to her estate, and Daniela is nowhere to be seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I&#39;m jealous of Jack. He has such an influential aunt.&#34; &#34;And Joyce, fortunate to have Daniela as her stepsister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be real, Jack and Joyce are both rotten to the core. It must tear Daniela apart, being unable to conceive. They parade around, flaunting it. Isn&#39;t that just twisting the knife in her heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s a dead end. Daniela can&#39;t have children.With all her wealth, there&#39;s nobody to pass it down to.That&#39;s truly unfortunate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must they really look for someone else to continue the family line? That&#39;s downright embarrassing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online forums were abuzz, repeatedly hitting the same note: Daniela&#39;s inability to conceive was a fact beyond her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twinge of sadness pierced Daniela&#39;s heart as she read through the comments, yet she harbored no resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Children are a twist of destiny; if they are meant to be in your life, they will find a way, and if not, no amount of pushing can change that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, who decreed that her fortune was destíned for the Harper family? Daniela and Carol made their way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was kneeling on the ground, looking dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he lifted his gaze, he noticed two figures approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One exuded an aura of refined tranquility, while the other simmered with palpable frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, caught in the middle, threw a glance in Joyce&#39;s direction. He couldn&#39;t tell which of the two women was Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,however,was lost in her own world,addressing the crowd of reporters with a spirited flair. &#34;The vast fortunes of Elite Lux were clearly meant for Jack.Honestly, who else would be the rightful heir? When Jack was just a tiny bundle in my arms, I pointed at the television, which showed my sister, and told him she was his aunt. Back then, I was oblivious to the fact that Daniela couldn&#39;t have her own children. I urged Jack to cherish Daniela not for her wealth but for the bond they shared. As the years passed, I reinforced to Jack that Daniela was as dear to him as I am, his mother. Every day,he would beam with joy, his little fingers tracing the contours of his aunt&#39;s picture. Now,my sister has not only accumulated a substantial fortune but also earned considerable respect. Sure,she&#39;s known for her fiery temper, but isn&#39;t that often the spice in family life? We endure, because that&#39;s what families do. Being family means sticking together,no matter what life throws at us. As for Daniela&#39;s riches, I&#39;ve never coveted them. We are family, after all. Should the wealth come our way,we&#39;ll accept it gratefully. If not,well,it&#39;ll find its way to us eventually. There&#39;s absolutely no rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice was rich with pride, her smile unwavering as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to the approaching figures of Daniela and Cade, and ignoring Jack&#39;s silent pleas for intervention,she continued unabated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela drew closer, she overheard Joyce boasting to the gathered crowd. &#34;Jack holds such deep affection for his aunt. He can&#39;t sleep without holding Daniela&#39;s photo close every night.&#34;</p>
