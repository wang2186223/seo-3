                <p>The bidding war centered on a newly discovered mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the negative impact of the last auction had caused and the information relayed by Damon,Hamilton was hell-bent on securing the win this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he shouted a bid five times above the opening price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The organizers didn&#39;t even pause before announcing the winner: McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze, dumbstruck. In his mind, Daniela would try all means to secure this bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when he stole a look at her bid, he nearly choked.One dollar!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and the secretary gawked in disbelief, both realizing Hamilton had been played by his own son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Damon hadn&#39;t secretly leaked that Daniela was eyeing the mine, Hamilton never would have bid sO recklessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon had set up his own father. Ironically, he sat there, scowling in frustration, blaming Hamilton for forcing him into finding Daniela&#39;s weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utterly humiliated, Hamilton stormed out, his fury leaving a trail in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the city was humming with gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear about Hamilton&#39;s bid today? What was he&#39;thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He threw five billion at a mine that&#39;s barely worth a fifth of that. I know the McCoy family prints money, but losing four billion in one shot? Insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s gotten into him lately? The man was always steady as a rock. Today he looked completely rattled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s because of Daniela. Word is she showed up at the auction too, and she only bid a dollar.&#34; &#34;Seriously? That&#39;s priceless! Daniela offered a single buck, and Hamilton lost his mind. It&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s losing his edge. Daniela&#39;s got him completely outclassed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, McCoy Group&#39;s stock nosedived. For the first time in his storied career, Hamilton stood before the shareholders and admitted his blunder. His apology hung in the air, tense and uncharacteristically humble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One shareholder flashed a polite smile. &#34;Come on, Hamilton, it&#39;s only four billion. We&#39;ll survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another echoed with a grin, &#34;Exactly. What&#39;s a few billion among friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled through the room, a chorus of rich amusement at his expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Hamilton sat quietly, a hint of relief softening his stern features-years of relentless work finally seemed to be paying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, the mood in the room shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, you&#39;re almost seventy now, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You son already has his own child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, most people your age would&#39;ve retired. You&#39;re still here, carrying all this weight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Life&#39;s meant to be enjoyed, Hamilton. If you&#39;re tired, maybe it&#39;s time to step down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric seems like a natural successor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And with Cedric and Daniela working together, the company could thrive. Daniela&#39;s a genius at making money-let her handle things while we all relax!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled around the table, everyone grinning with delight as if a long-awaited celebration had finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Hamilton, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s lips curled into a scornful sneer. &#34;Sure, I can retire.&#34; Everyone&#39;s face brightened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued, &#34;But | wonder-if Daniela ever discovered the explosion and her mother&#39;s death were both connected to McCoy Group, would she still be making money for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room froze. Every trace of laughter vanished, replaced by a heavy, suffocating silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the quiet clatter of the secretary&#39;s keyboard filled the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a thunderous roar burst from Hamilton&#39;s chest. &#34;Don&#39;t record this part!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outburst jolted everyone, and the secretary,startled, instinctively pressed save. She lifted her head,adjusting her glasses, meeting Hamilton&#39;s glare with wide-eyed confusion.</p>
