                <p>A pang of envy tugged at Nikolas, heavy and unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cedric was staring intently at him, and Daniela had zero interest in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization dragged Nikolas deeper into his own silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight&#39;s auction had been more than a show of wealth-it was a statement of Daniela&#39;s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, people saw Daniela standing toe-to-toe with Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, former rivals of McCoy Group sought to work with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, overcome with fury, smashed a cup in his spacious office and addressed the board of directors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do something about this! I pay you all generous salaries, and yet you show no urgency over McCoy Group losing its grip on the market? Find a way to force Daniela out of Oiscoll! Restore McCoy Group&#39;s full dominance and unchallenged control!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red crept up Hamilton&#39;s neck, his fury boiling just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around the table, no one dared to meet his eyes. A hushed voice finally rose from the back, bitter and resigned. &#34;This all started with the auction. If you hadn&#39;t lost, we wouldn&#39;t be bleeding clients. And even your son has joined Daniela. Everyone&#39;s talking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business meetings had always bored Damon, but the moment he caught the final words of the hushed conversation next to him, a spark lit in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton fixed a sharp gaze on his remaining sons. His tone turned firm. &#34;One day, McCoy Group will be yours.If you want to keep it standing, you better start proving you&#39;re capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three of them jumped in, tossing out rushed suggestions to appease him.Meanwhile,Damon simply leaned back, an unreadable grin settling across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about it rubbed Hamilton the wrong way. The longer he stared, the more his unease grew. Finally, he hurled his cane aside with a loud crack. &#34;We&#39;re losing control of this company, and you&#39;re smiling?Damon, what the hell do you find so amusing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden shift in attention jolted Damon-everyone around the table was looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That flicker of pressure ignited something. A wild idea sparked in his mind, so bold he almost applauded himself for thinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking into a grin, he announced, &#34;I&#39;ve just come up with the perfect plan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton rolled his eyes, unimpressed.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed,Damon continued, &#34;Nikolas already jumped ship and joined Daniela, right? So why don&#39;t we send someone to infiltrate from our end? Plant an insider. Dig up whatever she&#39;s hiding and use that to bring her down.Sound like a plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The proposal, while reckless, wasn&#39;t entirely without merit. Hamilton leaned forward slightly, his scowl easing just a touch as he considered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Damon pushed back his chair and stood tall. &#34;If this mission needs someone daring, someone unexpected, I&#39;m your best bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever interest had just flickered in Hamilton&#39;s eyes vanished in an instant. His tone dropped like a blade.&#34;You? You couldn&#39;t even decipher a balance sheet. If a secret walked up and introduced itself, you&#39;d still miss it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon wore a look of frustration as he said, &#34;Exactly! My incompetence is my strength here. Daniela would never suspect someone like me. That&#39;s the genius of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles opened his mouth, likely to offer himself instead, but Damon was already on the move. &#34;Settled then! I&#39;ll head over to Daniela&#39;s place right now. Don&#39;t worry, Father-I&#39;ll come back with answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Charles blinked, Damon had bolted, already halfway down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the scene unfold, Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;He&#39;s running like he&#39;s going to meet his idol,not going undercover.&#34; Dread crept into Hamilton&#39;s chest, but before he could second-guess the decision, Damon was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton called the housekeeper and told him to block Damon from sneaking back to grab his things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours ticked by. The living room remained silent, undisturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela arrived home and chatted with Cedric on their walk uup the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the distance, someone crouched near the front door caught their attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Nikolas pulled something like this, at least he brought some belongings with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This figure had nothing-no suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol squinted. &#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the sky already darkening, Daniela could barely make out anything besides a tuft of messy hair catching the porch light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, however, rushed forward like he&#39;d just spotted a security threat. &#34;Damon! Are you serious right now? Turn around and leave. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being brothers for so many years, they could understand each other with just a single glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas immediately figured out Damon&#39;s real reason for showing up-he was clearly trying to get close to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning over, Damon whispered to Nikolas, &#34;I&#39;m undercover, man. Don&#39;t ruin it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind them, Daniela blinked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undercover?</p>

                <p>Was he serious?</p>
