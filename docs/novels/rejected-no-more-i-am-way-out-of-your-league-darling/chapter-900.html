                <p>Defeated and grumbling, the McCoy family left, unable to hide their embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, McCoy Group&#39;s stock price wobbled ever so slightly. But such instability was unheard of for a company usually known for its rock-solid performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The board wasted no time in calling an urgent meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Hamilton appeared far more composed than before. He settled into his chair at the head of the table, scanning reports with a detached air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around the table, concern deepened on every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening here? Why are we seeing this kind of movement in our stock? This has never happened before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Maybe this is a minor hiccup for most firms, but for McCoy Group, any change is a big deal. The finance department already told me this blip cost us nearly a billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The marketing department is scrambling to figure out the issue. Let&#39;s discuss how to handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease settled over the boardroom, leaving only nervous glances and silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton offered no comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting a few seats away, Josh McCoy fixed Hamilton with &#39;a look of open irritation. &#34;Hamilton, what&#39;s the meaning of this? You made such a spectacle yesterday over nothing, and now you&#39;re just sitting there?Maybe you&#39;re not cut out to be chairman anymore. I don&#39;t see any effort from you today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill entered Hamilton&#39;s tone. &#34;You know what? Maybe you&#39;re righnt. I&#39;m done. If you think you can handle it, the chair is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boardroom went still, a hush falling over every voice. After a long moment, a brittle laugh broke the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re family. There&#39;s no need to take things.so far. You&#39;ve always been the leader, Hamilton. Don&#39;t let this get to you.&#34; The speaker was Alison McCoy, her face plastered with a fake smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a cold chuckle. &#34;Am I being too dramatic? Haven&#39;t you all been plotting to push me out for years? I&#39;m tired of playing this game. If anyone wants the job, take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boldness in his words left the room stunned and speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh,who had been so brash before, now forced a grin. &#34;Let&#39;s not get carried away. You know how tense things are right now. If the company suffers, we all lose out. You can&#39;t just wash your hands of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, the McCoy family had always tiptoed around Hamilton, never daring to challenge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, with age creeping up on him, Hamilton sensed their respect slipping awNay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of unwavering dedication to McCoy Group now seemed meaningless in the face of their cold stares.He understood that no matter how much he wanted distance, the bonds of family were not so easily broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela knows you played a role in her mother&#39;s death. She came to me about it before, and I have every reason to believe this dip in our stock is her first move,&#34; Hamilton said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking down a company as powerful as McCoy Group was no small feat. Yet, with Daniela&#39;s resources-the fortune of the world&#39;s richest person-Hamilton knew destruction wasn&#39;t out of the question. Should she decide to pursue revenge, the company would not escape unscathed. Clearly, these numbers weren&#39;t random blips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would Daniela have any way of knowing about what took place back then?&#34; The smile vanished from Josh&#39;s face,replaced by a stern and icy look. With narrowed eyes, he fixed his gaze on Hamilton. &#34;Were you the one who told her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dozens of eyes drilled into Hamilton, searching for guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t go behind our backs, did you, Hamilton? Did you secretly reveal everything to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to walk away from all this because you weren&#39;t on the front lines back then?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s not right, Hamilton! The McCoy family has always stood as one. Don&#39;t start separating yourself when things get tough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your way of gaining favor with Daniela and Cedric, throwíng us under the bus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusations kept piling up on him, one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice never found its way into the conversation. Judgment arrived swiftly and without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief clouded Hamilton&#39;s gaze as he stared at the faces he had once trusted most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had devoted his whole life to shielding these very people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had gone so far as to sacrifice his own children, all for the sake of protecting these relatives. Yet this was the opinion they held of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt and disappointment burned through him. Rising from his seat, he declared, &#34;If this is truly what you think of me, then nothing I say will matter. Handle things however you wish. No one can accuse me of favoritism toward Cedric and Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s footsteps echoed as he strode out, refusing to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From somewhere behind him, a voice burst out in anger. &#34;Can you believe him? He reaped every benefit and wants out when the trouble starts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He never had a problem enjoying the gains from Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s sickening. We took all the risks, and now he pins it on us to save his own skin!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those cruel voices chased after him, and Hamilton&#39;s lips quivered with anger and heartache as he walked away.</p>
