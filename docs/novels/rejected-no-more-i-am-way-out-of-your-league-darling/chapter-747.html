                <p>The DNA testing process was straightforward. A blood sample or a hair sample would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To promote transparency and dispel any doubts,the McCoy family had cleverly opted for a laboratory encased in glass walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This allowed onlookers to observe the staff&#39;s every move as they conducted their precise work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas addressed the gathering with a clear, authoritative tone. &#34;To eliminate any suspicions of foul play with the results, we&#39;ll take two samples for the test. Both a blood sample and a hair sample will be collected,starting with my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical team operated with a practicedefficiency, drawing Hamilton&#39;s blood and securing a strand of his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ensuring everything was in order, Nikolas turned his icy gaze to Cedric, commanding, &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric was about to comply, a calm, interrupting voice cut through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Daniela said, her voice steady and-firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; expression darkened, his voice chilling as he snapped, &#34;What&#39;s the problem? Are you scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attention in the room shifted instantly to Daniela, the air thick with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton casually adjusted his sleeves, his expression one of detached curiosity. He was keen to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>see how Daniela and Cedric would navigate this theatrical ordeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held her ground, her voice imbued with a cool confidence. &#34;How can I trust the accuracy of your equipment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of laughter broke out among the onlookers, dismissing her concerns as trivial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? This equipment is our owNn!&#34; &#34;Daniela, what exactly are you implying?&#34; Kohen&#39;s face twisted into a sneer. &#34;These devices were developed by our family and have gained global recognition. Their precision is unparalleled. How dare you cast doubt on our technology?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained serene, a stark contrast to Kohen&#39;s agitation. &#34;Machines can indeed be manipulated, and i the end, it is people who make the ultimate decisions. If I harbor doubts, f will voice them. Or perhaps, is the McCoy family so tyrannical that questioning is forbidden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his jaw, his frustration evident. &#34;Daniela,enough with the theatrics!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile, Daniela countered, &#34;You yourself emphasized the critical nature of DNA testing. I must exercise caution. The most straightforward method to validate your device&#39;s accuracy is to conduct a comparison using Mr. McCoy&#39;s and another sample. If the results align, I won&#39;t object again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; lips formed a tight line, his patience thinning. &#34;I don&#39;t have time for your games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela was already one step ahead. She approached a sophisticated-looking woman cradling a dog and deftly plucked a strand of hair from the pet. With a graceful gesture, she handed it over to the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; anger flared immediately. &#34;Daniela, what are you playing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s reply was light, almost teasing. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Reluctantto.proceed with the test? Or perhaps you doubt the reliability of your own machines? Are you concerned that the results might reveal that this dog shares the McCoy&#39;s esteemed lineage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere at every McCoy family banquet was always charged, drawing a slew of prominent journalists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, things were getting out of hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, observing the unfolding drama, furrowed his brow in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in cautiously, his secretary murmured, &#34;Mr. McCoy, do you want us to step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded in a steady voice, &#34;Let her make a scene. The notion that my DNA could match that of-a dog is absurd. Daniela is merely trying to shield Cedric. With this many cameras flashing, the last thing l need is to be caught in the middle of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gave a solemn nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, his expression icy with disdain, handed a tuft of dog hair to the staff. His gaze bore into Daniela like a dagger; if hatred alone could end a life, she wouldn&#39;t be breathing anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When those results come back, you&#39;ll realize you&#39;ve only made a fool of yourself. Nothing but a pathetic stunt for attention,&#34; he snapped, venom dripping from his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stepped up to assert his authority. &#34;This is Oiscoll. You&#39;re on our turf, Daniela. Soon you&#39;ll see just how we deal with disruptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles held his tongue, careful not to push Daniela away when he might need her help later. He mumbled under his breath, &#34;Daniela, what are you trying to pull? You know Dad&#39;s going to be upset about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon crossed his arms and scoffed, &#34;Daniela, once the results are confirmed, you&#39;ll have no choice but to comply with the DNA test for Cedric. You&#39;re just wasting your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, Duran taunted her. &#34;Just wait, Daniela. You&#39;re about to become the butt of all jokes. Our equipment is top-tier; the outcome is inevitable. You&#39;re setting yourself up to be the fool of the year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the rising tension, Daniela raised her glass, her demeanor unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing her composed features, Hamilton felt an inexplicable surge of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes involuntarily darted towards the lab just as a voice announced, &#34;The results are ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accompanied by the mechanical chime of the printer, the eagerly awaited report glided out.</p>
