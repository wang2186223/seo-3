                <p>A sudden, sharp pain jabbed at Alexander&#39;s chest. He stared at Daniela&#39;s emotionless face, desperately searching for any sign of feeling. &#34;Daniela, do you have any idea why I came after you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face stayed composed, her eyes empty of any emotion, as if she were staring at someone utterly foolish -or maybe even a lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look she gave him hit a nerve, and Alexander felt his emotions begin to unravel. His voice rose with frustration as he pointed to the stairs. &#34;Katrina&#39;s in surgery, Joyce is falling apart, and your father is still fighting for his life. Yet here I am, after you. Do you know why? Because I&#39;m worried about you, Daniela! You shouldn&#39;t move back. After today, Katrina will never let this go. Joyce may be a fool, but Katrina isn&#39;t. She&#39;s calculating, and you&#39;re too emotional. How do you think you stand a chance against her? And your father doesn&#39;t even care about you. Why return to a place where you&#39;re not wanted? Is it just for the villa? You don&#39;t need the money, Daniela. I don&#39;t understand. Why are you intentionally walking into danger? What do you hope to accomplish? Is it because of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daniela thought Alexander might still possess some intelligence. But the moment she heard his last sentence, a wave of disgust washed over her. Without saying a word, she tuned, opened the car door, and climbed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, is that a yes?&#34; Alexander shouted, his frustration building as he slapped the car window in exasperation.&#34;Are you afraid I&#39;ll marry Joyce and you&#39;re trying to stop it? Are you worried someone else will take me from you? Is that why you&#39;re putting yourself in danger? Tell me, Daniela, is that what this is all about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was desperate to confirm his suspicions. He had spent so much time thinking about it upstairs,and this was the only explanation that seemed to fit. Why else would Daniela choose to move back? Nothing else made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s earlier words echoed in his mind, cutting through his thoughts. &#34;I bet Daniela still has feelings for you. That&#39;s why she&#39;s moving back!&#34; In that instant, everything fell into place for Alexander. He was certain he&#39;d figured it all out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why he had followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to tell Daniela that there was no reason for her to risk herself on his behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she still wanted him, he would gladly marry her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else could she possibly want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela&#39;s car drive off, Alexander stood there in the parking lot and yelled after her,&#34;Daniela,if you have a change of heart, come find me! I&#39;ll give you a few days to think it through!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in the driver&#39;s seat, with Cedric beside her in the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been hoping that Alexander would ask the questions he had been dying to know.But...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came to a harsh realization-Alexander&#39;s mindset was no different from Joyce&#39;s. Two complete fools!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite himself, Cedric glanced at Daniela. Her lips were pursed, and a faint trace of anger shadowed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he nervously broke the silence with a question. &#34;You don&#39;t like Alexander,do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Daniela burst out laughing, taken aback by how ridiculous the question was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Cedric, a mix of amusement and annoyance in her eyes. For a brief moment, she entertained the thought of kicking him out of the car. But then, she shook her head with a sigh and said,&#34;Cedric,I swear your brain works just like Joyce&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,why are you angry?&#34; he asked.」</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went quiet, her thoughts momentarily drifting. She shut her eyes, releasing a long,slow breath.When she spoke again, her voice was soft, almost a whisper. &#34;Because I&#39;m embarrassed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt ashamed of who she had been-someone so consumed by her feelings for Alexander.Now, confronting Alexander&#39;s twisted conclusions and selfish assumptions, all she could feel was regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Cedric, who was usually so perceptive, had just asked her if she still had feelings for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed her eyes once more, trying to calm the storm of emotions raging within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she found a moment of stillness, Cedric&#39;s voice broke through, low and steady. &#34;Daniela, love me. I&#39;ll be loyal to you for the rest of my life.&#34;</p>
