                <p>Alexander lingered at the entrance of his villa, a cigar resting between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Richard exuded an air of smug contentment. &#34;With this, your claim to Daniela is uncontested-not just in Olisvine, but across the entire country. The CEO of Elite Lux, unable to bear children? A scandal like this has made her the subject of ridicule. Alexander, have Daniela over for dinner again tomorrow. And let me warn you now-I won&#39;t be nearly as courteous this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,Daniela was the most sought-after CEO in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, in the eyes of many, she was reduced to a tragic figure-a woman unable to carry an heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of Daniela shedding unseen tears within the walls of Elite Lux filled Richard with a sick sense of victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once extended a hand in friendship, only to be spurned. Now, Daniela would have no choice but to come to him, and he had no intention of being kindness. With Daniela bound to the Bennett family-her greatest weakness now a chain around her neck-Richard envisioned a future where he could manipulate her at will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought sent a wave of satisfaction through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, don&#39;t get ahead of yourself. Daniela isn&#39;t the type to break so easily,&#34; Alexander cautioned, unease gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once sworn to protect her, to cherish her yet here he was, complicit in a scheme designed to shackle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifferent gaze haunted him, her voice like a blade against his conscience. &#34;We both know the truth,so let&#39;s not make this messierthan it already is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had fought to deny it, but now, the truth was undeniable-he had betrayed her, becoming exactly the man she had condemned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease gnawed at him. He dragged deeply on his cigar, each inhale a feeble attempt to steady his restless mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ember at the tip pulsed in the night, a tiny,burning reflection of his chaotic thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the darkness, a figure came charging towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander squinted, trying to make out the intruder,but before he could process it, they were already upon him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander barely had time to blink before a fist slammed into his face with bone-rattling force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain exploded through him. He staggeed back,clutching his face, his thoughts scattering like shattered glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had his nose just been broken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face-his most valuable asset, the one thing he had counted on to keep Daniela close-was now throbbing with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you? What do you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even finish, another fist smashed into his face, cutting him off mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, there was no mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each blow landed with brutal precision, his face becoming the canvas for Cedric&#39;s fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander barely managed a whimper, folding in on himself,arms shielding his battered face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Richard stood paralyzed,horror stretching  across his face. He bellowed, &#34;Cedric, have you lost your damn mind? What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Richard could spit out another word, Cedric grabbed Alexander by the collar, yanking him forward with violent intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The raw,murderous rage in Cedric&#39;s eyes sent Richard stumbling backward, fear gripping his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I&#39;ve never bothered to fight you not because | fear you, but because I wanted Daniela to have love, to be surrounded by it. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s from me or someone else-she deserves to be surrounded by love. That&#39;s why I let your arrogance slide. I didn&#39;t fight back. But this? You call this love? It was you, wasn&#39;t it? You&#39;re the one who spread those filthy rumors! Do you have any idea what people are saying about her now? Alexander, you&#39;re going to pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fist shot up, ready to bring down another crushing blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carefully sculpted face Alexander prided himself on was now a swollen, bloodied ruin beneath Cedric&#39;s relentless fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clutched his ruined face, breath hitching as Cedric&#39;s fist hovered dangerously over his ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat slicked his skin as he choked out, &#34;What right do you have to judge me, Cedric? Who the hell do you think you are? Some righteous saint?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fist froze mid-strike. &#34;What the hell did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Alexander shoved Cedric&#39;s arm away and staggered upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dripped from his shattered nose, his once-proud face now a grotesque mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swayed but forced himself upright. &#34;What do you think I said? You think I hurt Daniela? And what about you? You really think you were her savior back then?Do you even know who planned the explosion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened. He had been digging for answers, but every shred of evidence had disappeared overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you?&#34; His voice was ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I know,&#34; Alexander said, a wicked smirk twisting his lips. &#34;From the moment that explosion tore through everything, I searched-day after day,for three long years while you lay there in a coma.And yet, you still don&#39;t have the answer, do you?Daniela&#39;s villa was locked down with a world-class security system-no one got in unless their face was logged in the system. So think, Cedric. How many people had access back then?&#34; Before Cedric could fully grasp the implications.Alexander&#39;s voice dropped to a venomous whisper.&#34;Have you ever wondered why Josie suddenly killed herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sent an icy dread slicing through Cedric&#39;s veins, leaving him frozen in place, his entire body gripped by a suffocating cold.</p>
