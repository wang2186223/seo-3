                <p>The disappointment from yesterday&#39;s failed plans had soured Daniela&#39;s mood, leaving her little patience for niceties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a voice devoid of warmth, Daniela questioned,&#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems Joyce might have been caught up in a scam. I&#39;ve already reached out for some help,but they&#39;re not as efficient as your contacts at Elite Lux.Could you possibly get someone on it?&#34; Katrina asked, her voice laced with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela proceeded downstairs to have her breakfast,with Katrina trailing right on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela had finished her meal, Katrina, unable to contain her desperation any longer, pleaded,&#34;Please, Daniela, can you help me? I&#39;m truly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>desperate here. Joyce has poured all her savings into this venture!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was already aware of the situation. With a nonchalant air, she picked up her phone, tapped a few keys, and declared, &#34;The company is a sham.They&#39;re planning to vanish abroad with the investments in a matter of days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck her. Her complexion drained of color, and suddenly, she found herself collapsing to her knees. &#34;What can we do?Help us, please! That money is all Joyce has!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed Katrina, now crumpled on the floor and weeping bitterly. A frosty gleam flickered in her eyes as she recalled Katrina&#39;s harsh words yesterday -that Brylee deserved to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was oblivious to Daniela&#39;s thoughts. She was consumed by panic. If Joyce lost the money, she&#39;d never recover financially. Her future would be bleak and filled with hardship. What could possibly be done now? &#34;Please,&#34; Katrina implored, her voice quivering with desperation. &#34;I&#39;m begging you, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a slight, indifferent smile. &#34;I can&#39;t assist with this matter. You might want to speak with Alexander. Milo has ties to the Bennett family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left her statement deliberately vague, shrouded in ambiguity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cryptic words caused Katrina&#39;s mind to race toward a darker interpretation. She deduced that the Bennett family had never truly welcomed Joyce,cunningly using Milo as a pawn in a sinister plot.They resented the hefty fifty-million-dollar divorce settlement they were compelled to pay, devising a scheme to reclaim it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the wake of Daniela&#39;s veiled insinuations, Katrina stood frozen momentarily, her thoughts frantically assembling the pieces. A sudden epiphany struck her,propelling her to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say? Milo and Alexander know each other?&#34; The more Katrina considered it, the clearer it became. She had always felt that Milo and Alexander looked somewhat alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by fury, Katrina murmured a terse thanks to Daniela, grabbed a knife from the table, and stormed out, her emotions in turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering, Cedric noticed the fierce anger etched across Katrina&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to her?&#34; he inquired, turning to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shrug, Daniela narrated the events, to which Cedric responded with an approving thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This tactic of deflecting the blame had taken Alexander by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronting Alexander, Katrina demanded, &#34;Do you know Milo Brewer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without room for denial, Alexander admitted, &#34;He&#39;s my cousin.&#34; Those words incensed Katrina further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, she withdrew the knife from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident erupted into headlines, igniting a whirlwind of media attention. Speculation soared wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The crap these rich folks pull gets nastier every day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Alexander actually paid some guy to seduce his wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I didn&#39;t think it was possible for a man to stoop so low and embarrass himself this badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rumor has it, he&#39;s still yearning for his ex-wife.Could this be the reason for his desperate actions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pathetic Joyce, always the idiot falling for his manipulative schemes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the scandal intensified, the Bennett family&#39;s reputation suffered a devastating blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their stock prices plummeted to unprecedented lows, leaving Alexander in a frantic search for solutions. His only feasible strategy was to convince Joyce to publicly clarify the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce answered his call, her response was a chilly laugh. &#34;You must be dreaming! When we were married and you disregarded me, I didn&#39;t see you debasing yourself like this. Don&#39;t think for a moment that I&#39;m unaware of your motives. Your recent scramble to forge new partnerships is nothing more than a ploy to reclaim Daniela&#39;s affection. Well,here&#39;s a newsflash-I won&#39;t let you manipulate me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp click, Joyce ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment, the Bennett family&#39;s chance to rectify their tarnished image was irretrievably lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina faced legal consequences for her previous actions. By the time she was released, darkness had enveloped the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She attempted to reach Joyce, but her calls went unanswered. Weighed down by defeat, she trudged back to her home, where she took a long shower and finally collapsed into bed, utterly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she lay in the dim quietude, her mind wandered through a lifetime of calculated maneuvers that had led her to this dismal point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drained to her core, Katrina found no solace in rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, at the brisk hour of five, she jerked awake, stirred by an unyielding instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, instead of venturing out, she paused by her bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes ticked by until the soft creak of a door pierced the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, suspicion igniting like a flint spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, Katrina twisted the doorknob and peered through the sliver of an opening. From this covert viewpoint, she spied Cedric. A crease formed between Katrina&#39;s eyebrows as pieces of a disturbing puzzle began to fit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the ensuing days, she monitored Cedric&#39;s comings and goings with a hawk&#39;s vigilance, her suspicions growing as she uncovered his secret late-night visits to Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one such occasion, as she strained to see through the thin crack of her door, a slight noise escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric halted on the staircase, his head snapping in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked through the narrow gap-his gaze icy and commanding, exuding a dominance that sent an involuntary shiver cascading down Katrina&#39;s spine, even as he was the one cloaked in secrecy.</p>
