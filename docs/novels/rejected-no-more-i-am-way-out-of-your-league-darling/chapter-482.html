                <p>It was still early when Daniela left Phillips Group. So she made her way back to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian arched a brow and glanced behind her. &#34;What&#39;s wrong this time? Did you hit another snag?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s shoulders slumped. &#34;He&#39;s really angry this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned back in her chair, pausing her video game. &#34;Why don&#39;t you just tell Cedric the truth? It&#39;s just his family, right? No need to back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression clouded at the mention of Cedric.Knowing his complicated family dynamics made her wary-a feeling she couldn&#39;t shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the shift in mood, Lillian set her controller down and focused entirely on Daniela. The distant echoes of virtual gunfire filled the vast office space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thoughtful pause, Lillian suggested, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s time to let this go. Cedric&#39;s involvement only complicates matters. If he starts resenting you,then why bother? Why not make life easier? If it all falls apart, maybe it&#39;s best to divorce Cedric. That way,neither of you has to deal with any mess. Sounds better,right?&#34; Daniela&#39;s hand trembled slightly at Lillian&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to ignore the quiver, giving her palm a gentle squeeze to soothe the growing ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian offered, &#34;It&#39;s better to end things soon than to let the agony linger. If you can&#39;t face him, I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze drifted, her expression clouded by distant thoughts. &#34;Lillian, you just don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gaze fixed on Daniela, confusion etched across her face. &#34;What&#39;s there to misunderstand? You managed perfectly well before Cedric came along.Even if he backs off now, who&#39;s to say the future won&#39;t bring more heartache? Your relationship is bound to dwindle. Wouldn&#39;t it be wiser to part on good terms now while some fondness remains?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Cedric&#39;s determined face earlier that day flashed in Daniela&#39;s mind, reigniting the trembling in her hand. This time, the pain was sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian caught the subtle change instantly, her voice faltering. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her features etched with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s battle with depression had been a closed</p>
