                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Alexander stormed into the Elite Lux building, his chest heaving, his emotions in turmoil.Tears streamed down his face, unchecked, as though he had been dealt the deepest betrayal. &#34;Are you pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked onto Daniela, his eyes dark and searching. &#34;You&#39;re carrying Cedric&#39;s child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced around; it was already the early hours of the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was away on a business trip. She hadn&#39;t seen the point in going home, so she stayed behind,planning to spend the night at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discomfort of her pregnancy had driven her upstairs for some fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discomfort of her pregnancy had driven her upstairs for some fresh air. She never expected Alexander to barge in like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get up here?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s heart twisted, as if an unseen force had reached inside him and crushed it. His voice dropped, thick with grief. &#34;Does it matter? Daniela, I just need to know-is it true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell to her flat stomach. &#34;Tell me you&#39;re lying Say you&#39;re just trying to get back at me. You&#39;re not actually pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could the girl who had loved him for ten years be carrying another man&#39;s child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes of the past blurred his vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had stood before him and confessed her feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had learned to race and drink for him. With a microphone in hand, she had confessed to him on a stage under the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was so vivid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still trapped in the days when she loved him,while she had already moved so far ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had tried so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even reshaped himself into someone new-just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you see? Can&#39;t you see how much l want to be close to you? Are you really so cold- hearted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood still, letting the night breeze brush against her skin. &#34;Alexander, I don&#39;t hate you. But the past is just that-the past. I don&#39;t cling to it, and I hope you won&#39;t either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander slammed the door shut with a loud bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound was so intense that Daniela frowned slightly, instinctively raising a hand to protect her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single movement sent a fresh. wave of pain crashing into Alexander. His vision blurred, his eyes burning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want a child? We can have our child. Daniela, I&#39;m no less than Cedric now. I have his looks. I have a body stronger than his. I command the commerce association-nearly ten thousand companies at my beck and call. I even have more power than Cedric now! Tell me,who else is more suited for you than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander spoke, he advanced towards Daniela,his expression twisted with a mix of obsession and suppressed rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instinctively took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t afraid of Alexander, but caution was a necessity now-she wasn&#39;t just protecting herself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking her eyes off him, she discreetly called Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she met his gaze and spoke steadily. &#34;You need to calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Alexander&#39;s shout cut through the night like a whip. &#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere! Daniela,you belong with me in this lifetime! Only me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked to the ledge behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she had a fear of heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving with deliberate ease, he advanced again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped at a certain point, and Alexander smirked, knowing this was her limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Afraid of heights, aren&#39;t you? You don&#39;t dare take another step back.&#34; Alexander spread his arms wide,his voice dripping with obsession. &#34;Come. Into my arms.&#34; He advanced, step by step, eyes dark with possession. He was so consumed by his obsession that he didn&#39;t notice the dangerous glint in Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I strongly advise you not to come any closer.&#34; But he didn&#39;t listen. His mind was already made up. All he could think about was taking Daniela home, locking her away where no one else could touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he kept her hidden, no one could take her from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would belong to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent a rush of twisted exhilaration through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot out, ready to seize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next moment, Daniela flipped him over her shoulder,slamming him to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pain tore through his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander lay on the floor. Daniela had left for a while now, yet he hadn&#39;t come to his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was pregnant,wasn&#39;t she? How could she have such strength?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a head taller than her, yet she had flipped him effortlessly, as if he weighed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was unable to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had rushed over, only to stop dead in his tracks. He stared at Daniela in disbelief. &#34;Daniela, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still dazed, Cedric pulled her into his arms, holding her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You reacted pretty fast just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gavea small smile. &#34;Did I? Just instinct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Lillian barely stifled a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was still reeling. &#34;Alexander is a head taller than you. From that angle, pulling off a clean shoulder throw should&#39;ve been nearly impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned thoughtful. &#34;Really?Maybe I have a natural talent for Taekwondo? I&#39;ve always been flexible, you know-slim and agile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a breath, shaking his head in amazement. &#34;That&#39;s impressive.&#34;</p>
