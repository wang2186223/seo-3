                <p>Alexander went to the luxury goods boutique to select a gift for the CEO of Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce walked alongside him, her chatter bubbling with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, Alexander? Bringing me along was the best decision you made. I asked my friend and was told the CEO of Elite Lux is a handsome man and a golf aficionado. It seems all these high-flying CEOs have a penchant for the game these days. Imagine gifting him a golf club-he&#39;d be over the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander cast a skeptical glance her way, his brow furrowing slightly. &#34;Are you certain about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded emphatically, her eyes sparkling with certainty. &#34;Absolutely! My friend is incredibly well-connected. This is advice you can count on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Alexander&#39;s silence lingered, clouded by disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The CEO of Elite Lux was discreet, and tangible details about their personal likes were scarce. Alexander found himself questioning the credibility of Joyce&#39;s so -called &#34;well-connected&#34; source, especially given  that the last time he had acted on such advice, it had led to an embarrassing fiasco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on.&#34; Joyce looped her arm through his and tugged him towards a nearby golf store. &#34;Trust me on this, Alexander. This enigmatic CEO is definitely into golf. My friend is tight with him, and he even promised to make introductions later. Let&#39;s just pick out a club.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s uncertainty lingered as he followed Joyce into the shop, his confidence buoyed by her evident assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of this one?&#34; Joyce paused before a golf club, beckoning himn closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering at the price tag, Alexander saw the figure: eight thousand dollars. The amount struck him as too modest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the CEO of Elite Lux, such a modestly pricedgift might not even merit a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Joyce, radiating satisfaction, countered his concerns. &#34;Do you realize how tough it is to earn a buck these days? Besides, my friend is setting up this meeting. We don&#39;t need to splurge on a gift. The CEO of Elite Lux already has more than enough. It&#39;s our sincerity that will resonate with him, not the price tag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words did little to assuage Alexander&#39;s discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cost of the gift wasn&#39;t mnerely about the money -it was a testament to their regard for the recipient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his reservations, Joyce&#39;s optimism was infectious. &#34;This is it. It&#39;s absolutely perfect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile broadened, touched by a spark of anticipation. Recent events had cast a shadow over both their families, and Joyce was intent on mending fences and gaining Alexander&#39;s esteem. &#34;Trust me on this, Alexander. My friend won&#39;t let you down. Once we meet, all you need to do is focus on your proposal.It&#39;ll go smoothly, I promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gazed at Joyce&#39;s self-assured expression with a hint of uncertainty. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Joyce responded with a vigorous nod,her eyes gleaming with conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander handled the payment, Joyce lingered by his side, her brow furrowed in mild frustration. &#34;Why even go through with this, Alexander? It&#39;s simply throwing money away. In today&#39;s world, it&#39;s not what you know, but who you know. Having me by your side should suffice. Why lavish money on such trivialities?Just have the staff at the golf shop package it nicely.I&#39;m not demanding like that spoiled Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these words, Joyce&#39;s face lit uup with a smug triumph, her demeanor dripping with disdain. She radiated an air of superiority, as if she stood leagues above Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce believed this demonstration of frugality would convince Alexander of her worthiness as a partner,perhaps even leading him to propose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander,meanwhile,brought the golf club home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of stunned incredulity washed over Richard&#39;s face the instant he noticed the price tag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around, his gaze piercing Alexander as he pointed at the golf club. &#34;You&#39;re not seriously thinking of gifting this to the CEO of Elite Lux, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tried to clarify his intentions, but Richard burst into scornful laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That cheap,penny-pinching mindset runs so deep in Joyce, it&#39;s pathetic. She&#39;s leagues behind Daniela.Remember the last golf club Daniela presented? It was leagues beyond this! And now you plan to offer this worthless stick to the CEO of Elite Lux?Alexander, you&#39;re not seriously trying to embarrass yourself,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexander had to admit the gift, Joyce&#39;s recommendation, came off as slightly unimpressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to instruct his secretary to exchange it for a superior golf club, his phone rang with an urgent update. &#34;I&#39;ve just heard from reliable sources-the CEO of Elite Lux&#39;s plane touched down ahead of schedule!They&#39;ll be at the Luxor Tower within the hour!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling deeply,Richard strolled into the storage room and emerged with a gift box, elegantly wrapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this instead-the golf club Daniela gave me before. It&#39;ll make a better gift for the CEO of Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, Alexander examined the club&#39;s intricate patterns and the label on the box. &#34;Is this a custom design?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that morning, a shop assistant had mentioned,&#34;Anything custom-designed starts at a minimum of two million.&#34; Alexander was aware that Daniela frequently bestowed gifts upon Richard, yet the lavishness of this gesture was unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two million?&#34; Richard gestured towards the inscriptions on the club. &#34;This piece is the creation of a globally acclaimed golf club artisan. It&#39;s a singular masterpiece-not even four million could buy one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clutched the golf club tighter, his eyes widening in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did she acquire such wealth? As far as he knew, ever since the death of her mother and with Katrina at the helm of the Harper famnily&#39;s finances, Daniela had been cut off from any family allowance. How, then, did she manage to fund such an extravagant gift?</p>
