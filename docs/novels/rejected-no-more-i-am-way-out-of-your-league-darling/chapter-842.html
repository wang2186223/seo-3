                <p>Hamilton snapped with growing impatience, &#34;Spit it out and get out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped from Damon as he gave a nod, then turned his attention to the document, scanning it closely more than once. &#34;Acrophobia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brows drew together. &#34;Are you certain? Take another look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the paper down, Damon said confidently, &#34;It&#39;s acrophobia. But there are variations-some fear all heights, some only a certain level, and others link it to a bad memory from when they were kids. It&#39;s not easy to be exact. Still, I can tell you for sure-Daniela&#39;s weakness is fear of heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spending enough time in casinos had taught Damon how to lie like it was second nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had developed a sharp instinct for feeding people the exact answers they were hoping to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lies were so believable that even Hamilton couldn&#39;t tell if they were real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sure it&#39;s acrophobia?&#34;Hamilton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave him a hard stare. &#34;Father, if you don&#39;t believe me, why did you bother dragging me here? Right now, your doubt feels like a slap in the face. Ask around. Go ahead. Find out who taught me. Most people may not understand this stuff, but for me, it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t stop there. &#34;Let me give you an example. Kohen? He used to be obsessed with his wife. Now?It&#39;s all about money. Or take your secretary-he&#39;s terrified of the dark. The head chef? He freezes up at the sight of insects. And you, Father,your weakness is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard enough!&#34; Hamilton interjected, completely fed up. &#34;Leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood!&#34; Damon flashed a cheeky grin as he stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he turned to go, Hamilton called out, &#34;Hold on. Take Kohen with you.&#34; For a brief second, Damon&#39;s face tightened, his true feelings carefully masked from everyone around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he turned back, that familiar relaxed smile had returned like nothing ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kohen? Why would I bring him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both you and Nikolas live at Daniela&#39;s place. So why can&#39;t I stay there as well?&#34; said Kohen, tossing an arm around Damon&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I want a taste of Cedric&#39;s cooking too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin formed on Kohen&#39;s face, but it didn&#39;t reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they headed toward Daniela&#39;s place, Kohen kept his voice light, acting as if the question was nothing serious. &#34;So... is it actually true that Daniela&#39;s scared of heights?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s brows knit together. &#34;You don&#39;t believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Kohen patted his shoulder. &#34;What are you talking about? Of course I believe you. It&#39;s just...Daniela is cunning and sinister. I&#39;m worried she might&#39;ve fooled you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill slipped into Damon&#39;s voice as he asked, &#34;Do you even know anything about Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Kohen stiffened slightly, then gave a practiced smile. &#34;Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t let up. &#34;How can you speak so harshly about someone you&#39;ve never taken the time to understand? Even Father, who stands against her, never used that kind of language. She&#39;s a young woman,Kohen. Talking like that isn&#39;t just rude, it reflects poorly on you. What&#39;s the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, Kohen looked surprised, but he quickly covered it up with a weak laugh. &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d gotten so good with words. Looks like you&#39;ve been defending Daniela quite a bit lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a lot of respect for her,&#34; Damon replied simply. &#34;She&#39;s never picked a fight with anyone. She&#39;s never hurt anyone. People just keep coming after her. That explosion-someone set that up. Someone caused her to lose her baby. If shedidn&#39;t fight for justice, then what kind of mother would that make her?She&#39;s chasing every lead, crossing all the way to Oiscoll just to uncover the truth for both her child and her mother. That kind of determination deserves respect!&#34; Damon, who was usually the most relaxed person in any room, now spoke with a passion that stunned those around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the driver up front stole a glance at him through the rearview mirror, clearly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen, however, let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;That was a fine speech, Damon. But have you ever stopped to wonder if someone in our family might&#39;ve been behind the explosion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon opened his mouth, ready to argue that their father would never go that far, but Kohen didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;If it really wasn&#39;t one of us, then why was Cedric not there when it happened? He&#39;s Daniela&#39;s legal husband. He stands to inherit everything she owns. If someone wanted to destroy everything she built,don&#39;t you think killing Cedric would&#39;ve been part of the plan? Why did they pick the exact window when Cedric was away? It&#39;s because someone already knew that Cedric is a McCoy. Someone made sure not to harm him on purpose. With facts like that, can you really claim our family had no hand in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words hit Damon like a slap. He couldn&#39;t speak. He couldn&#39;t even move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen gave a cold laugh and casually dusted off his sleeve. &#34;You&#39;re still a McCoy, Damon. No matter what that bloodline stays with you. Daniela won&#39;t go easy on you if the truth ever comes out. So whether you realize it or not, you&#39;ve already chosen a side. You&#39;re already Daniela&#39;s enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weight dropped in.Damon&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scenes from his time at Daniela&#39;s place came rushing back without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the way Daniela and Cedric had treated him-with nothing but kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the moment he imagined himself standing against them,his stomach turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the thought of food made him feel sick.</p>
