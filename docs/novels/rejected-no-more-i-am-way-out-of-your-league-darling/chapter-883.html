                <p>Cedric was nearly hoisted into the car. It wasn&#39;t that he couldn&#39;t resist; he simply gave in after Nikolas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>earnest pleas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The least you can do is join me for a meal,right?I heard you cook for Daniela every day. She&#39;s rich but can&#39;t afford a chef?&#34; Hamilton said mockingly.&#34;Today&#39;s my birthday. Don&#39;t you think you should keep me company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas frowned, confused. &#34;Dad, you just had your birthday Did you forget?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face remained firm. &#34;That was a self-assigned birthday. Today&#39;s the real one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled on toward the McCoy family&#39;s estate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice softened with sincerity &#34;Success demands time and sacrifice.You all say I&#39;m harsh,but do any of you realize l&#39;ve never celebrated my birthday on the actual day? Have I ever once complained? No one finds success without cost in this world. It&#39;s only fair to pay the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Hamilton glanced at Cedric through the  rearview mirror, searching for even a flicker of feeing Instead,Cedric was lost in his phone, typing away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and disappointed, Hamilton turned his gaze away but couldn&#39;t resist sneaking another look at Cedric&#39;s screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, the contact name blinked on Cedric&#39;s phone.&#34;Honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shut his eyes with a sigh of irritation. That hopeless romantic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,&#34; Hamilton snapped, unable to hide his irritation. &#34;We&#39;re right outside the McCoy family&#39;s estate. Aren&#39;t you going to look? It&#39;s far more interesting than your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary driving chimed in eagerly, &#34;Mr. Phillips,you have to see this. The estate stretches over two hundred acres, with basketball, soccer, golf,horseback riding, archery, and a range of luxury sports facilities. It even has the longest running track in Oiscoll We&#39;re cruising along the scenic coastline,and at the highest point sits the main villa-the crown jewel of luxury homes. Priceless and unmatched. The view ahead is breathtaking. From up here, you can see the whole Oiscoll spread out below.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wrapped up his message to Daniela,promising to come home later, then casually slipped his phone back into his pocket. He turned his gaze toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunset was flawless-like a golden sash draped across the sky casting its glow onto the vast sea,turning the waves into shimmering golden scales. The view was breathtaking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s chest swelled with pride. &#34;What do you think? Not bad, huh? This is the kind of place fit for living.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gestured toward a crooked tree outside &#34;See that? That&#39;s the Love Tree. Local legend says couples who make wishes beneath it are blessed with eternal love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, Cedric turned to examine the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tree&#39;s branches were draped with fluttering red silk ribbons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary smiled warmly. &#34;This tree is special Every Valentine&#39;s Day, the McCoy family opens it to the public, and countless couples come to wish for lasting love. It&#39;s well-known-featured even in Oiscoll&#39;s news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes sparkled with interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton imagined that if Cedric and the princess dated beneath this tree, their love would be eternal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly sent a message to the princess. The car kept climbing higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After over an hour, they reached the summit at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had already made up his mind-when he bought a house, it would never be a mansion so far from the city center. The commute was just too mnuch hassle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, clearly proud, said to Cedric, &#34;What do you think? The estate is pretty vast, right? You didn&#39;t get a proper tour last time. Make sure you take it all in today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary chimed in. &#34;The mansion is a true display of Oiscoll&#39;s heritage and luxury. With our dedicated guide,you can fully immerse yourself in its grandeur today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton headed upstairs to change into fresh clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the guide started the tour, Cedric&#39;s disinterest showed clearly. He leaned toward Nikolas and whispered. &#34;Why is your father suddenly flaunting all this stuff to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned. &#34;Does he think I&#39;ve never seen the world? Is he trying to put me down by showing off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shook his head. &#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. You&#39;ve never cared much about this stuff,have you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled an auction where he&#39;d bought an elegant,pricey antique vase. Since he was staying at Daniela&#39;s place, he figured he shouldn&#39;t mooch off her, so he gifted her the vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vase was worth more than fifty million at the time.It was definitely expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely looked at it, thanked him quietly, then went off to eat Carol&#39;s sandwiches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Nikolas caught sight of Cedric using that fifty-million-dollar vase to hold a bouquet of roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was completely stunned. He figured Cedric didn&#39;t grasp how valuable it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric shrugged and explained, &#34;It&#39;s just a vase. If it&#39;s not holding flowers, what else can it really do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, completely at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he had to admit Cedric made sense</p>
