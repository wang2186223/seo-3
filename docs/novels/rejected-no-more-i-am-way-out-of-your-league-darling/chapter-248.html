                <p>Richard was pushed to his limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fuly grasped why Alexander hádn&#39;t shared a room with Joyce yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason was his unresolved feelings for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to the hope of reuniting with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleeping with Joyce would solidify their status as a married couple. If Daniela ever changed her mínd, how could he explain his actions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret consumed Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would have never consented to Alexander&#39;s marriage to Joyce if he had a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s presence was far.more dominant than Daniela&#39;s, and she couldn&#39;t handle any criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, she pretended to be nice, but as the robotics company flourished, her arrogance became unbearable. She even insulted Richard, calling him an oldman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart was overwhelmed with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of person had he introduced to the family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s audacity had grown to the point where she even dared to kidnap Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Richard turned to Daniela for help, knowing the hackers she commanded were unrivaled.Finding Joyce&#39;s location should be easy with Daniela&#39;s assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard tensed as he dialed Daniela&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After one ring, a deep, cold voice answered, &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Richard saw Daniela&#39;s number on the display. How could Cedric be on the other end? It was nearly midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Daniela there?&#34; he whispered, hesítating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric immedlatety recognized his voice and responded, &#34;Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. 1 need to speak with Daniela. Can she come to the phone?&#34; Richard Inqurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric Jooked over at Daniela, who was engrossed in assembling à Lego model, and replied emotionlessly,°She&#39;s busy.You can talk to me about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard knew he couldn&#39;t discuss his concerns with Cedric. That would be akin to exposing his strategy to a rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whispered, &#34;Never mind,&#34; and quickly disconnected the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric held the phone, hesitated briefly, and then headed to the corridor to find Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan, see what Alexander and Richard are doing tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Ryan indicated the surveillance footage displayed on the computer screen from outside a &#39;bar, &#34;There&#39;s not much to see, but the video shows that Alexander never made contact with Joyce. His secretary stepped in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan adjusted the computer, and the camera view shifted to follow Joyce to a villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa&#39;s entrance, Joyce was already pecking Alexander on the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander seemed confused, his movements as erratic as his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both entered the home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the massive window bathed in warm yellow light, they stripped each other and staggered upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, everything was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chuckled. &#34;Interesting. Alexander was being forced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,with a knowing smirk, realized the purpose of Richard&#39;s earlier call. Joyce was intent on binding Alexander to herself, and Cedric decided to assist her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Ryan and instructed, &#34;Release this surveillance footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Olisvine was abuzz with rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would have guessed Joyce was so unrestrained? She couldn&#39;t even wait to get inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a closer look, that&#39;s neither the Harper&#39;s nor the Bennett&#39;s doorstep. The couple found another spot for their escapades.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Alexander awoke with an intense headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reflexively reached for his phone, he felt an arm over his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The events of the previous night came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially stern, Alexander&#39;s face slowly relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and saw the woman turned away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair cascaded down her back, and in a raspy voice, Alexander called out, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
