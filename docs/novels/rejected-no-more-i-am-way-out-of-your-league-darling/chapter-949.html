                <p>Hamilton said, &#34;If you turn this down, someone else is going to grab it. Think of it as me making things right and paying what&#39;s owed. It&#39;s free money sitting in your lap. Why push it away? What you do with the McCoy family from now on is up to you. Just don&#39;t get involved with anyone in our branch. That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking. Everything else is your call. I mean that with all sincerity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t speak. The sound of rushing water from the faucet filled the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept going. &#34;I&#39;m telling you-this is what&#39;s best for Daniela and the baby she&#39;s carrying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had gone on for a while. Still, that last sentence hit the hardest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shut off the faucet. A few seconds passed before he said, &#34;Wait here. I&#39;ll be back in five minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton already knew he was heading to talk to Daniela. &#34;You&#39;ve got a sweet deal right there, and you&#39;re still going to ask Daniela first? Cedric, you&#39;re a man. You should...&#34; Cedric threw him a sharp look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton backed down.&#34;Alright.Fine.Go.I&#39;ll stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a long breath. McCoy Group, once the biggest company in the country, was now just a name.People barely even respected it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips drew into a tight line. He couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric went to Daniela and told her everything Hamilton had offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to take over McCoy Group? Sure.Don&#39;t worry too much about it. Even if he didn&#39;t give it to you, l would&#39;ve got it anyway. It&#39;s nothing serious.Not even worth arguing over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela treated seizing McCoy Group like it was some kind of game. She spent her days flipping departments upside down just for fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came back and told Hamilton, &#34;I&#39;ll head to McCoy Group first thing tomorrow. You don&#39;t need to tag along. Just give me the authority. And my wife&#39;s coming with me to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked stunned. &#34;You don&#39;t need me at all?You&#39;re sure you can handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept slicing vegetables. &#34;My wife says the ones  who cooperate can stay and the rest are out. We&#39;ll bring in our own team. She planned to buy the remaining shares and take over the board in five days.Guess we&#39;re just skipping ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood frozen, unable to form a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear now. Daniela had been planning to take over McCoy Group from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he not stepped aside, he would&#39;ve been humiliated by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those arguments he made to sway Cedric had gone to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, if your branch had nothing to do with the explosion or her mother&#39;s death, she&#39;ll drop it. But if any of you were involved, she won&#39;t hold back.&#34;Cedric met Hamilton&#39;s eyes. &#34;This isn&#39;t up for discussion. I&#39;m telling you how it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric left the kitchen again, but Hamilton still hadn&#39;t moved for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he saw Cedric, it felt less and less clear who was really in charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Cedric brought Daniela with him to McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s pregnancy was stable. She hadn&#39;t been dealing with any nausea or pain. Still,Cedric wouldn&#39;t leave her behind and insisted she come along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped into McCoy Group,confusion swept through the company. All eyes were on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing staff could already feel a migraine setting in at the sight of those two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had shaken the company&#39;s stock prices like an earthquake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Josh already giving up so many shares, the business stood on shaky ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as someone from marketing was about to speak,another figure stepped out of a nearby car.&#34;Daniela?Why are you here? Is this a joke to you? Trying to rub it in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice belonged to Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had shown up that morning because Hamilton claimed he would come to save the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what he didn&#39;t expect was to see Cedric and Daniela standing at the entrance together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met his eyes with calm indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad reached for his phone and spoke in a rush.&#34;We&#39;ve got a problem! Everyone come now. Daniela&#39;s  McCoy Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the way he sounded, one might think he had just spotted a wild animal at the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was about to step up, but Daniela stopped her with a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About thirty minutes later, all members of the McCoy family showed up-all except Josh, wo had already betrayed them.Hamilton came too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, what&#39;s going on? We agreed you&#39;d be in charge of McCoy Group. It was fine when Cedric got involved, but why bring Daniela? Is this company even part of the McCoy family anymore?&#34; Brad spoke with clear tension in his voice, already wishing he hadn&#39;t said anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew exactly who Daniela was. She didn&#39;t just lead an international group of mercenaries. She was a fighter with serious skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wvilling to risk losing an arm, or worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught the look of fear on Brad&#39;s face but didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned instead to Jules and Ethan, both watching quietly nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice was cold and sharp. &#34;Are you two also going to object?&#34; Jules and Ethan both understood McCoy Group needed someone strong enough to rescue it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that person couldn&#39;t be Daniela. They had their own reasons. Their eyes darted toward Daniela with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were the ones responsible for her mother&#39;s death.And they knew vengeance-not money-would be driving her now. Daniela didn&#39;t need their wealth.She had more than enough herself. So what didthey have that could convince her?</p>
