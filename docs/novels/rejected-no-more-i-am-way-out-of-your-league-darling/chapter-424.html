                <p>As Caiden&#39;s positive answer rang out, a thick silence fell over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To those people, it was a murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Brylee, it was a cocktail of emotions-bitter anger,a sorrow that cut deep, and the painful realization that everything had been one cruel joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trust she&#39;d given, so genuine and pure, had been shattered by nothing more than a self-interested liar with noremorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Cedric hadn&#39;t made a move before, now, he stepped forward, his body heavy with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian lifted her hand, her voice firm but calm. &#34;This isn&#39;t the end, Cedric. You need to put your faith in Daniela.&#34; Ryan, too, silently raised his hand, stopping Cedric in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart ached for Daniela as he looked at her,his face etched with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, almost detached, kept eating her orange as if nothing had happened, lifting her chin and asking Caiden,&#34;Any leads on that intermediary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shook his head. &#34;No, but I did overhear someone on the other end refer to him as Mr. Perry during a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Perry again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve told you everything,&#34; Caiden begged,his voice shaky. &#34;Please, take me to the hospital. No matter what I did, I&#39;m still your father. You can&#39;t just let me die, right? I regret it all. I wish I&#39;d been honest with your mother from the start. She was capable, so much better at handling this than | was. I was foolish,too scared to think straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly stood and moved towards Caiden,  starting to loosen the ropes that bound him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her fingers worked on the knots, she asked, &#34;Did you ever love my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded quickly. &#34;I did. Of course, I loved her.Your mother was the only real love of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face twisted with sincerity, his emotions spilling over as if he were a servant pleading for forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Well, I don&#39;t think my mother would&#39;ve cared,&#34; Daniela retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face went slack, his gaze locking on Daniela with a mixture of confusion and shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She lived her life with so much pride, carving out a name for herself in the business world. She never let anyone down, not even you. She treated you with nothing but honesty and loyalty. My mother was a gem in this world, and you didn&#39;t deserve her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s heart skipped a beat, his gut telling him that Daniela wasn&#39;t finished just yet. &#34;When you die,I won&#39;t bury you next to my mother.I&#39;ll put your ashes with Katrina&#39;s instead. I hope you two stay tangled together, whether in life or death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela finished loosening all the ropes and noticed the fear spreading across Caiden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, the same way Brylee had when they first met Caiden. For a brief moment, Caiden couldn&#39;t tell whether it was Daniela or Brylee standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not going to let you die that easily.Death&#39;s too quick for you. Someone like you deserves a lifetime of lonely suffering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes went wide with shock. He stared at Daniela with a blend of disbelief and fear. &#34;You can&#39;t do this to me. I&#39;m your father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved her hand dismissively, and the emergency medical team walked in, nodding at her before carefully placing Caiden on a stretcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cure him fully. Once the swelling is down,send him to the remote psychiatric facility. The wounds will keep getting worse in this heat. Just make sure he doesn&#39;t die,&#34; Daniela instructed calmly.&#34;I want him to live a long life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the shock took its toll, and Caiden passed out completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That all happened at Elite Lux&#39;s private hospital. As the medical team made their exit, they quietly cleaned up the bloodstains left behind on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strong smell of disinfectant hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother turning on the lights. Instead,she just sat on the sofa, peeling and eating an orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to peel another slice, Cedric hurried down from upstairs and stopped right in front of her.</p>
