                <p>Daniela rose from her chair. Cedric stood as well,instinctively mirroring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved him off. &#34;I don&#39;t need a bodyguard. Sit your butt down and peel me some shrimps-I&#39;ll be back to eat them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric could only obey, sinking back into his seat with a small sigh of surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela turned to leave, Charles sneered at Cedric, his tone dripping with mockery. &#34;Weren&#39;t you the one looking down on me not too long ago? And now look at you-following her orders without question. Seriously, Cedric, is she really worth turning into her loyal little servant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could respond, Daniela whipped her head around and fixed Charles with a cold, cutting glare. &#34;Shut up,&#34; she snapped. Charles shut his mouth immediately. Daniela tossed Cedric a firm look. &#34;Don&#39;t move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without another word, she strode off in Hamilton&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she was out of range, Charles exhaled hard and slumped in his chair, poking at his plate like a sulking child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his fork aimed for the shrimps, Cedric pulled the entire plate toward him, claiming it like a prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was loud and clear-back off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, come on. Do you really have to play the loyal lapdog?&#34; Charles looked baffled. &#34;We&#39;re brothers,remember? Can&#39;t youI give me just one shrimp?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, Cedric peeled &#39;another shrimp.&#34;Ask Hamilton if you&#39;re that desperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles clamped his mouth shut, silenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gazed out at the rolling waves. &#34;Daniela,you&#39;re no fool. People with your intellect don&#39;t waste time with niceties. The wise always recognize which road leads to the greatest gain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze without flinching. Through the glass, she spotted Cedric, quietly peeling shrimps with full concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew this about Cedric-whatever he did, he poured himself into it completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered evenly, &#34;Then I guess I&#39;m not as clever as you think, because I haven&#39;t a clue which path you believe is right for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile faded just slightly-he never liked when people didn&#39;t bow to his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People with too much fire in their spirit always clashed with control and Daniela was the embodiment of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; Hamilton said smoothly. &#34;If that&#39;s how you want it, I&#39;ll get straight to the point-I&#39;m selecting a successor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Hamilton&#39;s eyes stayed locked on Daniela,searching her face for the slightest flicker of greed or ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, he saw nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained unchanged-cool,unreadable, like a still pond hiding its depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s patience thinned, and a chill entered his voice. &#34;At first, I planned to choose from my five sons. But now that Cedric&#39;s stepped out of the shadows, I&#39;m offering him a place in the running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone rose like a man used to being obeyed, crisp with authority and entitlement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton pressed on, &#34;The terms are clear. Cedric must return to the family fold, take the McCoy name,and step into his rightful place among us. From that moment, he&#39;ll fall under my guidance. Whether he ascends to the top depends entirely on his own merit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s stare was frosted glass. &#34;Why are you saying all this to me? It&#39;s got nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes drifted toward Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the second Hamilton walked in, Cedric hadn&#39;t looked his way-not even once. It was obvious Cedric had no intention of calling him his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and he are on different paths,&#34; Hamilton remarked. &#34;Your views are worlds apart. You understand the power and prestige that comes with being the richest person on earth. You should let him know-this kind of opportunity doesn&#39;t come around often. It&#39;s not something anyone can claim just by wishing for it. I&#39;m aware he takes your words to heart.If you speak, he&#39;ll follow your every command.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was plain to Hamilton now-Cedric was hopelessly smitten. Daniela was the axis his world spun around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued, &#34;If Cedric becomes part of our family, it works to your advantage as well, doesn&#39;t it?So, why else would you travel all the way to Oiscoll?You&#39;re not the type to get involved unless there&#39;s something for you to gain. I know what you&#39;re looking into. If you convince Cedric to join the McCoy family, I&#39;ll secure you a position on McCoy Group&#39;s board and make you one of the key decision-makers. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton believed he&#39;d laid down an offer too tempting for anyone to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, in his mind, this was why she had come to Oiscoll in the first place.</p>
