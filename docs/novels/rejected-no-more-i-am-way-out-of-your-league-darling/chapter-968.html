                <p>The sharp crack of the slap left the entire room reeling in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long beat, the group just gawked at Josh, eyes darting from his reddening cheek to Daniela&#39;s calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock hit Josh last-his jaw slack, then snapping shut as rage twisted his features. Slowly, color drained from his face, replaced by a venomous glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, how dare you hit me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked ready to unravel, teetering on the edge of a breakdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred darkened his gaze, turning it icy and deadly as he stared at Daniela. &#34;You must be tired of living. Not even my father ever raised a hand to me. Who the hell do you think you are? Mark my words, Daniela-one of us isn&#39;t leaving this room alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning,he drew a dagger, the blade catching the light as it emerged from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton and his brothers froze, caught off guard,but before they could react, Daniela struck. In a blur, her fingers closed around Josh&#39;s wrist, squeezing so hard his hand flew open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dagger hit the floor with a metallic clang,skidding away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s wrist twisted awkwardly, agony flashing across his features as he dropped to his knees in defeat.Daniela barely seemed to move, her expression unfeadable, cool as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched down to Josh&#39;s level, her eyes hard as steel. &#34;Clearly, your parents never taught you manners.Today, I&#39;m giving you a lesson for their sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, flushed with rage and trembling from the pain shooting up his wrist, found himself unable to form words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat trickled down his forehead as he fought to catch his breath. Instead,he turned his anger outward,voice raw with desperation. &#34;Are you all blind? Can&#39;t you see she&#39;s out of control? Hamilton, what are you waiting for? Get this lunatic away from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his outburst ended, his complexion turned ghostly, his lips blanched to an ugly white</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was gulping for air, chest heaving as if the room itself were closing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the McCoy family stood frozen,Mother caught in a tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan snapped out of his shock first, darting between them and raising both hands defensively. &#34;Daniela,come on, we&#39;re not here for blood. We just want the money back. Can&#39;t you ease up a little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton rushed forward, his expression strained.&#34;Daniela, maybe take it easy, okay? Think about the babies you&#39;re carrying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Daniela unclenched her grip, letting Josh&#39;s arm drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He collapsed onto the floor, every inch of him slick with humiliation and sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing her with a glare, he spat out, &#34;Touch me again and see what happens. You really think you&#39;ll get Ethan&#39;s money out of me? Keep dreaming. If you&#39;re so brave, kill me right here in Oiscoll!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into an amused, almost lazy smile as she stooped and plucked the fallen dagger off the floor,twirling it once between her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s expression contorted, a violent tic flashing across his cheek at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton immediately rushed in, desperation in his voice. &#34;Daniela, let&#39;s not do this here. Josh might be an asshole, but he&#39;s still family. The new McCoy Group barely has its footing. We don&#39;t need blood on our hands right now, do we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he shot a pointed glare at Josh and demanded, &#34;Why the hell did you pick a fight with her?Are you trying to get yourself killed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Josh&#39;s secretary leaned close,voice barely above a breath. &#34;Sir, you&#39;d do well to remember-she&#39;s the mercenary leader. Watch your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh ground his teeth, fury simmering beneath his skin,but powerless to retaliate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could manage was a shaky threat. &#34;Daniela,don&#39;t think thisis over. I&#39;ll make you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Josh stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hunched over, shoulders tight, slinking toward the door as if he could slip away unnoticed. His retreat drew barely muffled laughter from his siblings, who found his desperation oddly satisfying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s icy voice sliced through the room.Without raising her head, she spoke flatly. &#34;Did I say you could go?&#34; The rain drummed against the window,deepening the chill that clung to her words. &#34;No one&#39;s leaving this office until we&#39;re finished here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh spun around, his temper snapping. &#34;Daniela, are you out of your mind? Do you even realize where you are right now? This is Oiscoll! Maybe you should think twice before pushing your luck. I&#39;m warning you-let me walk out while I&#39;m still willing to be civil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton edged closer to Daniela, lowering his voice in a hurried plea. &#34;Hey, maybe we should cool off.This isn&#39;t the right moment for a showdown. We can sort it out later, can&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, visibly rattled, clutched his chest as if steadying his heartbeat. &#34;He&#39;s right, Daniela. When Josh gets like this, he loses it completely. If we take this any further,nobody wins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, torn between resentment and resignation,finally managed to speak up, though his voice was barely above a whisper. &#34;Dan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela cut him off with a wave of her hand,her expression uncompromising. &#34;Sorry, but I don&#39;t give a damn about anyone&#39;s feelings. Josh, unless you hand over the thirty billion today, I promise you&#39;ll regret ever crossing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s laughter spiraled into a wild, taunting shout.&#34;Daniela, tell me-does your dead mother know just how arrogant you&#39;ve become?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant those words left his mouth, the room turned glacial. Every breath seemed to echo off the walls, the silence punctuated only by Josh&#39;s ragged exhale.&#34;My mother...&#34; A tremor flickered across Daniela&#39;s face as she ground the walnut in her fist until it snapped in half with a sharp crack. Her voice dropped to a chilling whisper. &#34;You dare bring up my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Hamilton caught the wild,flickering turmoil in Daniela&#39;s gaze-a storm of fury and old wounds.Beneath the surface,her rage churned, barely restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Hamilton&#39;s voice faltered, barely more than a whisper, but she didn&#39;t even glance his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Daniela&#39;s head snapped back as a cruel,eerie laugh escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, every person in the office braced themselves, certain Daniela would annihilate Josh on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However...</p>
