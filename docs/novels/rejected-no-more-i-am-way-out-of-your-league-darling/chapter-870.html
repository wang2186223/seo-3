                <p>Watching Cedric&#39;s spirits lift so quickly, Carol could only sigh as he dashed down the stairs, all smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes and muttered to herself.&#34;Unbelievable A simple sandwich and suddenly everything&#39;s right in his world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sofa,Daniela barely registered the low drone of the TV. Her thoughts wandered far from the living room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Hamilton really the only one who knew the truth about her mother&#39;s death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe someone else inside McCoy Group knew. If that was true, she would have two options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could join McCoy Group, working from within to get closer to the truth</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other route-launching an all-out business assault-would force Hamilton&#39;s hand, driving him to the edge until he finally cracked and confessed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That second option, though, would rip away any last hint of civility between her and Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard she tried to deny it,Daniela had always pulled back just a little. Cedric&#39;s connection to the McCoy family kept her from going too far</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day Hamilton demanded she leave Cedric, her answer hadn&#39;t come instantly. Deep down, she wanted to shield Cedric from the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, everything had changed. Cedric would never accept being protected on the sidelines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After turning the situation over in her mind,Daniela realized there was only one real path left. She would have to see just how much pressure Hamilton could take before he finally gave up the truth</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton&#39;s anger was impossible to hide. If Daniela wanted a fight, he was more than willing to give her one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around and snapped at his secretary.&#34;Get Richard on the phone. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for the calI to connect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put Alexander through,&#34; Hamilton instructed, his patience wearing thin. The moment Alexander answered, Hamilton&#39;s tone turned icy. &#34;I ran the test myself,Alexander. Turns out, Daniela&#39;s not afraid of heights at all. Why didn&#39;t you tell me the real story back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the restaurant scene. He had chosen a rotating rooftop place. When the table drifted outward and they found themselves suspended dozens of floors above the ground, Daniela barely blinked-her attention fixed on the divorce agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t deny it anymore. His guess had missed the mark completely. Whatever fear haunted Daniela, it wasn&#39;t heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Alexander, you and Daniela are finished. No matter what you think you&#39;re protecting, I&#39;m going to find out the truth sooner or later. If you talk now,you might actually walk away with somnething. Think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing but silence answered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued, &#34;Ten million. That&#39;s my offer Let&#39;s not pretend you&#39;re in any position to turn it down Combine that with what you got for your company.and you and your father can live out your days in comfort. This is a one-time deal. Don&#39;t be foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Alexander kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard interjected, &#34;Mr. McCoy, give me a second.I need a word with my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton could make out Richard&#39;s weary voice in the background. &#34;Let it go, Alexander. Whatever you and Daniela had is over. You can&#39;t win her over anymore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But you can help your family-me, yourself, all of us.We need this money. Protecting her secret won&#39;t win you any gratitude. She&#39;s moved on. We&#39;re not part of her world now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears slipped down Alexander&#39;s face, hot and unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence. Alexander finally said, &#34;Fifty million. If you want Daniela&#39;s secret, that&#39;s the price Take it or leave it. If you come back later, it&#39;ll cost more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh rumbled from Hamilton. &#34;Even now,you know how to negotiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat. Alexander replied, voice razor-sharp, &#34;You helped turn me into this, Hamilton. Fifty million is what it&#39;ll take. If you wait, the price only goes up.&#34;</p>
