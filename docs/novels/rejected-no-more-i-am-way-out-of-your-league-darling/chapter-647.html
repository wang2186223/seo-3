                <p>Cedric lifted his face and met Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about them-dark, still, like he was always watching too closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the news.&#34; Cedric paused for a moment. &#34;I saw you crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;It was for the cameras.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, and whatever sadness lingered in his eyes started to fade. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t seen him in days and thought he had given up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he was standing here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed quiet for a beat, then looked at him.&#34;You don&#39;t have to take all the blame on yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced up, catching her eyes in the soft,fading light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t remember those three years. It&#39;s all a blank.But I know myself. I don&#39;t truust easily. If I gave Josie the key, it had to mean something. Everyone has weaknesses. You, me, and even Josie. You can&#39;t predict everyone&#39;s future actions. You were just acting with good intentions; it&#39;s not your fault,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s shoulders shook just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light behind him turned the front of him into shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;If this is eating you up that badly, maybe we do need to end this. Maybe letting go is the only way you&#39;ll ever feel free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric turned to leave, Daniela reminded him,&#34;Think it through. Come find me when you know what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after he left, Carol walked in. &#34;What did you just tell Cedric? He looked like he was about to fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips together and said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With cameras flashing and reporters watching,Daniela stepped out of the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way to her previous villa. Her smile was tight, almost sad. &#34;My mom bought this place. She told me it would be mine one day-when I got married.But Caiden and Joyce are still living here. I&#39;ve tried talking to them. They won&#39;t leave. The furniture inside?Those were my mother&#39;s favorites. She&#39;s not here  anymore. And I&#39;m her daughter. I should at least make sure her things are being treated right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a heavy sighas cameras clicked around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the crowd turned their anger towards Caiden and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela saw Cedric standing outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised one brow, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect him to show up this soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you make a decision?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t trust them,&#34; he said. &#34;I want to go in with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Daniela smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a low chuckle. &#34;Those two? You think they can actually push her around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept his eyes on Daniela. This time, he looked sure of himself. &#34;I&#39;m going with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Alright then. Let&#39;s go.&#34; They walked past the old warehouse. It stil stood,burned out and broken, untouched since the explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowed down when they reached it, then quietly kept walking into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid stiffened when she saw them. &#34;Who are you?What gives you the right to burst into someone else&#39;s home like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head and spoke evenly. &#34;This place belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition hit the maid all at once. She realized who was standing in front of her. Her voice rose as she called out, &#34;Sir, Daniela&#39;s here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had just started down the stairs. But the moment he heard her voice, he froze, then quietly turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps were careful, but when he locked his door,the click was far too loud. Downstairs, they all heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid looked away, clearly embarrassed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More locks clicked behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes landed on the table. It was covered in expensive wine and untouched food. She turned to the maid. &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; &#34;You can call me Tasha, the maid replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced upstairs and gave a small nod. &#34;Looks like they&#39;re not coming down. All this food, and they&#39;re just going to let it sit? Guess the three of us will have to judge your cooking instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all took their seats at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha Byrd had clearly done something right. Even Caiden, who was known for turning up his nose at most dishes,wouldn&#39;t have complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol kept her head low as she ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept his eyes on Daniela while she placed a crab claw onto his plate. &#34;Go ahead. Try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when he finally started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a quiet fear in him now. Daniela talked about divorce like it was no big deal, and that shook him in a way he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t shown up today, he never would&#39;ve had the courage to come back. Not with the way things had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric chewed in silence, Daniela reached for a shrimp and peeled it slowly. &#34;Tasha, which rooms are they staying in now?&#34; &#34;The master room and the brightest guest room.&#34;Tasha replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those used to be Brylee&#39;s and Daniela&#39;s. Of course,they picked the best ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll move in tomorrow. Get two guest rooms ready downstairs. That&#39;s where Caiden and Joyce will stay,&#34;Daniela said, her fingers setting the peeled shrimp onto Cedric&#39;s plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even realize what she was doing until it was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when it happened, both of Daniela and Cedric froze.</p>
