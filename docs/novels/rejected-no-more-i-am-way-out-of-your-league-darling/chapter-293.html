                <p>The secretary let out a frustrated sigh. &#34;Are you all out of your minds? Daniela has someone. as remarkable as Cedric pursuing her. Why on earth would she waste a second on Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team exchanged puzzled glances. &#34;Then why did she keep the flowers Alexander sent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on Daniela&#39;s response, the secretary speculated, &#34;She probably just couldn&#39;t be bothered.Refusing would have meant explaining herself, and we all know she doesn&#39;t like revealing her weaknesses to outsiders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of outsiders, the group nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear: someone like Alexander could never hold the same appeal for Daniela as Cedric did. Alexander was under the illusion that his flowers had earned him the same privileges Cedric had-privileges like regular visits to Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, he took the opportunity to go up to her office,claiming it was to tend to the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, aware of Daniela&#39;s allergy to those flowers, simply told him they had been moved to the first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Alexander made his way downstairs, only to find the flowers placed near the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His excitement fizzled out in an instant, leaving him deflated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While walking around, he overheard the employees discussing Daniela&#39;s allergy to the flowers he had sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of frustration quickly shifted to guilt as he absorbed the information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to make it right, Alexander rushed out and bought an even larger pot of gardenias-bigger  than the one Cedric had given her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, this time, he didn&#39;t encounter Daniela.Instead, he crossed paths with Cedric, who had just finished tending to the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett? This isn&#39;t your company. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit inappropriate for you to be planting flowers here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile tugged at Cedric&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, he had always felt overshadowed by Alexander, never quite able to stand up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he was Daniela&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little fact gave him the confidence to speak his mind, as he now had every right to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though their marriage was still a secret, Cedric still ordered the staff to dispose of Alexander&#39;s flowers without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not something you can just do!&#34; Alexander snapped. &#34;Oh, I can and I will. You don&#39;t belong here,Alexander. Don&#39;t think you can crawl back to Daniela just because things fell apart with Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of anger spread through Alexander as he gritted his teeth. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it that way. It was just a simple gift, trying to be friendly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t need your gift. We already have flowers and someone to care for them. You&#39;re not needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage burned inside Alexander, but he knew better than to challenge Cedric face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of inferiority gnawed at him. In business,Cedric had the upper hand, and deep down,he knew he couldn&#39;t measure up to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this world, power and wealth were the keys to everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s fists tightened in silent resolve. He vowed to himself that one day he&#39;d stand toe-to-toe with Cedric. He would reclaim his place at Elite Lux,win Daniela back on his terms, and show her he  This Happy could provide all she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander stormed off, Cedric allowed himself a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s intentions were apparent and Cedric understood them perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wouldn&#39;t be granted the opportunity to redeem himself, nor would he ever stand before Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were certain losses that couldn&#39;t be undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Daniela&#39;s return, the secretary filled her in on the events of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he get upset?&#34; Daniela asked, her voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, assuming Daniela referred to Alexander, nodded. &#34;Yes, he was absolutely furious when he left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted her gaze towards the secretary.&#34;I was asking about Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s response was immediate. &#34;No. He was in a great mood. After Alexander left, he was tending to the flowers and humming a tune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiously, the secretary watched her and then asked,&#34;Should I handle these situations differently next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In business, it was often more advantageous to have allies than adversaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to worry,&#34; Daniela replied with composure.&#34;When I&#39;m not here, trust Cedric to handle matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela walked back to her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen, glancing at Lillian in disbelief. &#34;Lillian, what did Daniela mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s smile widened. &#34;It meant exactly what you think it did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are Cedric and Daniela an item?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a sly nod, accompanied by a quiet gesture to keep it hush-hush. &#34;Best to keep it between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, as Daniela stepped out for a meeting,Cedric arrived once more. He immediately noticed the warmer reception awaiting him in the secretary department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, we&#39;ve prepared your favorite coffee.Would you like me to make you a fresh cup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, this one&#39;s brand new and seems to suit you perfectly. Please, have a seat and let us know if it feels right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, here&#39;s the watering can. It&#39;s already filled for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked in confusion, &#34;What&#39;s with all the sudden enthusiasm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped the secretary&#39;s lips. &#34;Daniela mentioned that when she&#39;s away, you&#39;re the one in charge. We just want to make sure everything&#39;s perfect for you.&#34; Cedric&#39;s face lit up with a smile of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela entered, the door swung open, and she was instantly embraced by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary slipped out with a knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, Daniela found herself met with a tender kiss,warm and lingering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Daniela let out a breathless lagh.&#34;Are you really this happy?&#34;</p>
