                <p>Peyton&#39;s authoritative tone rang out, making Ronald and Wyatt grin like fools as she piled on ridiculous demands for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Ronald&#39;s child was practically leaping with excitement. &#34;I&#39;m going abroad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina observed from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood poised at the doorway, waiting for Caiden&#39;s return with the sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela&#39;s quiet demeanor, Peyton frowned slightly and pressed her lips together in mild annoyance. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re awfully quiet. What&#39;s the matter? You&#39;re not having second thoughts,are you?Remember, you&#39;re a Harper. A little expense shouldn&#39;t make you bat an eyelid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela remained silent,her expression unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s frustration grew, and she bit her lip, feeling a twinge of guilt for her past harshness towards Daniela. &#34;Alexander is willing to remarry you. Can&#39;t you manage a smile for that?&#34; At these words, Daniela struggled to contain her emotions. &#34;To begin with, I never sought your intervention.Furthermore, I&#39;ve severed all ties with the Bennett family, so kindly refrain from involving yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, who had been listening, nearly burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated by the exchange, Peyton&#39;s face darkened,and she abruptly slapped Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap was sharp enough to leave Daniela&#39;s hand visibly reddened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely flinched, her eyes remaining locked on the staircase,ignoring the sting on her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was yet to make an appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corridor, his voice resounded, calling out,&#34;Josie! Could you help me look for Daniela&#39;s sketchbook? It seems to have vanished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone in the family, it was clear that the sketchbook was Daniela&#39;s most treasured item.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absence of it sent a wave of anxiety crashing over Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie hastened upstairs and embarked on an extended search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton craned her neck, her voice laced with concern.&#34;What&#39;s happening? Why is this taking so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain her frustration any longer, Daniela stormed inside. A throng of curious onlookers trailed behind her, all cramming into her tiny room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mere ten minutes later, every corner of Daniela&#39;s room had been upended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where could it be?&#34; Daniela demanded,her tone icy and her expression steely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, not giving up, turned to Josie once more.&#34;Any idea where it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie, overwhelmed and close to tears, admitted, &#34;I honestly don&#39;t know. Mrs. Harper told me Ms. Harper should tidy her own room, so I steer clear of it.Besides, it&#39;s quite stuffy in here-no windows, no sunlight. It&#39;s usually deserted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s brow furrowed in response. Trying to reassure Daniela, he said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Josie hasn&#39;t touched anything in here, so it&#39;s bound to be somewhere around. We don&#39;t have many visitors, so it surely hasn&#39;t been misplaced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Daniela halted mid-motion, her eyes narrowing as she fixed a piercing gaze on Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you staring at me like that? I...&#34; Katrina suddenly remembered the black plastic bag Alexander had delivered just days prior. She had carelessly tossed it into the overflowing trash bin, commanding Josie to dispose of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of panic flashed through Katrina&#39;s eyes, a detail Daniela didn&#39;t miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is it now?&#34; Daniela demanded, her expression stern and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton grabbed Katrina by the arm and pressed,her voice laced with frustration. &#34;Where the hell is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfamiliar with the upper floors, Peyton was oblivious to the fact that Daniela had been relegated to such a modest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the grandeur of such a vast villa, it was astonishing that Daniela resided in a mere storage room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina exchanged a helpless glance with Caiden, her eyes begging for assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden asked, &#34;Where is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s response was hesitant, her words tumbling out awkwardly. &#34;That day, Alexander brought it here,encased in a worn-out garbage bag. When I felt it, it was stiff, like thick cardboard. So I tossed it into the  cash can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning abruptly towards Josie, Katrina rebuked her sharply. &#34;Josie! How could you let this happen? I threw out something important, and you didn&#39;t even care to check? What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie was caught off-guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina whirled to face Caiden, her unease palpable.&#34;Alexander&#39;s at fault too. How could he be so careless with something that mattered so much? At the very least, he could have packaged it properly. And really,what interest does a CEO like Alexander have in Daniela&#39;s sketchbook? If he hadn&#39;t taken it in the first place, I wouldn&#39;t have dismissed it as trash so thoughtlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood nearby, her fists balled in silent fury,her gaze fixated on Katrina. She glanced towards the door,noticing the lock that had long been weak, and her eyes darkened with a deep, unsettling shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried about facing Peyton&#39;s reprimand, Katrina hastily grabbed her phone and called Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, was the black garbage bag you brought over last time the one with Daniela&#39;s sketchbook in it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, interrupted during a meeting, took a moment to confirm. &#34;Yes, that was it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why on earth didn&#39;t you specify? I assumed you had brought actual garbage, so I threw it out. Now Daniela has returned and is looking for it. Can&#39;t you tell how this mess is making me look bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated in the conference room,Alexander hesitated before instructing Katrina, &#34;Please pass the phone to Daniela.&#34;</p>
