                <p>Cedric never smoked. However, when the security guard at the entrance offered him a cigarette, he took it anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless, he stepped outside, rolling the cigarette between his fingers. Before he realized it, he had wandered into a narrow alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the brick wall, hestared at the ground.Moments later, a faint shadow emerged at the alley&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused, the cigarette dangling from his fingers,and glanced up to see a man standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man,dressed in black, had a cold, fierce gaze and a long scar cut from his forehead to his neck, making his already menacing presence even more chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood upright, the cigarette still lazily dangling between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gust of wind rushed through the alley as the man lunged at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Cedric stepped out of the alley, the cigarette still untouched in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela stepped into the elevator. Nikolas caught up just as the doors closed, and it began to descend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was cold. &#34;If Cedric is hurt even slightly,you&#39;ll live to regret it for the rest of your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the doors opened and they could step out of the elevator, Daniela twisted Nikolas&#39; arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His screams reverberated through the halls of the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela strode out of the elevator, unmoved by the chaos unfolding behind her. A security guard hurried over and peeked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.McCoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the commotion, the secretary hurried over immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas crumpled to the floor, his face pale as sweat streamed down his forehead, soaking his white shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ignored his pleas and kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking a few steps, she spotted Cedric across the street,purchasing flowers from an elderly woman. In that moment, her restless, cold heart seemed to be soothed and she calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunset painted the sky in gold as Cedric walked toward her, lilies in hand, unharmed, and the spring breeze ruffling his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you out here?&#34; Cedric asked, offering Daniela the flowers. Before she could answer, he buttoned up her coat. &#34;It&#39;s cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief washed over Daniela, and she smiled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crushing weight in her chest dissolved, and she felt relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|I thought you didn&#39;t smoke,&#34; Daniela remarked, her gaze drifting to the cigarette between Cedric&#39;s fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric flicked it into a trash can and smirked. &#34;I don&#39;t.Just holding it for fun. Let&#39;s go inside. How about l make steak for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered casually,&#34;Okay.&#34; Then, after a pause,she asked, &#34;Why did you go out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took the flowers from her hands.&#34;T(get you these. Aren&#39;t lilies your favorite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, scanning the street. The familiar watchful eyes, like a predator stalking its prey, were nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go out alone again,&#34; Daniela warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to answer when he spotted Nikolas being carried out of the elevator, pale and trembling,supported by his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela approached Nikolas, raised her hand, and a sharp snap echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; screams gradually faded into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go upstairs,&#34; Daniela said to Cedric, ignoring Nikolas entirely. &#34;I&#39;m hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drenched in cold sweat, Nikolas stared blankly at Daniela and Cedric, who seemed perfectly fine and completely unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is this happening to me?&#34; he yelled, his voice laced with despair. Was he the only one who got injured?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stepped outside to call Ghost, but the line remained unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm barely hurt anymore when he shook it, buta deep unease coiled in his gut. &#34;Daniela&#39;s a lunatic,&#34; he muttered, as he rushed out to find Ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed an alley, something made him stop and he took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ghost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky was slowly fading into dusk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squinted. He couldn&#39;t tell if the person inside was Ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called out to Ghost again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, ragged sound from the alley answered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rushed inside, his heart pounding as he saw Ghost lying in a pool of blood, the words &#34;Get Lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scrawled across his face in jagged letters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold dread slithered down Nikolas&#39; spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands began to shake uncontrollably once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost, feared for his invincibility, had been defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been with Nikolas the entire time, never stepping out. So, who could have left Ghost in such a state?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Cedric have another ally? If such a formidable ally existed, Nikolas thought, he would have to recruit them into his family at any cost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas crouched beside Ghost, his voice urgent. &#34;Who did this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost struggled to clutch his chest, and in the next second, he coughed up blood and collapsed unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurriedly transported Ghost to emergency care,then arranged for his family&#39;s private jet to take him back to Oiscoll, a country renowned for its advanced healthcare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost remained unconscious as he was loaded onto the jet, a reality Nikolas couldn&#39;t help but regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still hadn&#39;t uncovered the identity of the person who had defeated Ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t matter. There was still time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the secretary boarded with Ghost, Nikolas specifically instructed, &#34;If Ghost wakes up, ask him immediately who it was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gave a sharp nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas made his way back to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike before, this time he entered Daniela&#39;s office with a palpable sense of trepidation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was a cold-hearted,ruthless woman!</p>
