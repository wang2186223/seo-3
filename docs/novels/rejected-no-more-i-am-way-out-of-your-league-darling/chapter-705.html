                <p>Daniela struggled to understand what Cedric was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight frown, she asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you want to get your leg healed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were steady, unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to talk if you don&#39;t want to. But when you&#39;re ready, you can come talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela never forced anyone to do something they weren&#39;t ready for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was always calm and rational. Daniela trusted that he knew how to handle delicate matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to step into the courtyard to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been some work-related issues lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she started to move, she felt a tug on her clothes. She turned and met Cedric&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent for a moment, quietly gazing into Cedric&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If...&#34; Cedric trailed off, his thoughts seemingly heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he continued, &#34;Is it because my leg isn&#39;t healed that you&#39;re always so kind to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t feel she was particularly kind to Cedric. &#34;Why ask that out of the blue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together, offering no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to face him, her patience growing. &#34;Cedric, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re asking this all of a sudden, but I want to make it clear that my kindness isn&#39;t tied to whether your leg heals. It&#39;s because you&#39;ve always treated me well.&#34; Despite losing her memories, Daniela could still sense the sincerity in Cedric&#39;s actions. She wasn&#39;t blind to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, if my leg can&#39;t be healed, will it bother you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone grew serious. &#34;It&#39;s your leg. Whether you seek treatment or not is your choice. You should think about how you feel first. I don&#39;t care whether your leg heals or not. You&#39;re still the person I knov/right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded but still asked stubbornly, &#34;So, you&#39;re saying that even if my leg can&#39;t be healed,you wor think less of me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply replied, &#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could sense the relief wash over Cedric as her words sunk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even smiled, the tension easing from his shoulders. &#34;That&#39;s good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to speak, Carol stepped into the room. &#34;Natalie&#39;s working on a bomb. It should be ready soon. You need to stay alert in the coming days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol added, &#34;We&#39;ve located Winslow&#39;s position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes hardened, a chill creeping into her voice. &#34;Take control of him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded.&#34;Understood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could say another word, Nikolas barged into the room. &#34;Cedric, Charles mentioned you don&#39;t want treatment. Why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked visibly anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot Cedric a brief look before walking towards him. &#34;No treatment for now. If there&#39;s nothing else,you should leave Olisvine. Either Phillips Group or Elite Lux won&#39;t be working with you.&#34; Nikolas froze, stunned. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned and instructed Tasha to pack Nikolas&#39; and Kohen&#39;s bags and set them by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood in shock. Why had Daniela become so resolute all of a sudden? She had always been somewhat indifferent in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Nikolas demanded, his voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was quiet but firm as she responded, &#34;I&#39;ve already told you-if you upset Cedric, you leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; agitation grew. He shot a quick look at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared completely unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re doing this for his own benefit! How could he be upset? Do you have any idea hów much time and energy we&#39;ve invested? And you just reject us? Can&#39;t you at least consider others&#39; feelings?&#34; Nikolas&#39; control was slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a man accustomed to getting his way, this rejection was unlike anything he&#39;d ever experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time was critical. Word had already come from Oiscoll that Hamilton had scheduled another meeting with the lawyer this morning to discuss the heir once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had to be eliminated!</p>
