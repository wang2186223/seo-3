                <p>The crowd fell into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them all, Elyse was the most shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had sacrificing her daughter&#39;s purity, all to ensure Cedric&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Linden made a move, Cedric had appeared, alive and unscathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s lost innocence held no meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, she had irreparably damaged her relationship with Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Nina, she was met with nothing but cold indifference, her daughter&#39;s eyes filled with distant disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pang of grief struck Elyse&#39;s heart. It dawned on her-she might have lost Nina for good. &#34;Cedric?&#34; Linden&#39;s voice wavered in disbelief. &#34;You woke up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cedric didn&#39;t spare Linden a glance. His focus was entirely on Daniela as he walked to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone&#39;s shock, he dropped to one knee before her. &#34;Darling, you&#39;ve endured so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a tender show of devotion, he kissed the back of Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly and led him away, leaving the others in stunned silence, their minds reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela vanished from view, Natalie could no longer mask her frustration. She spun on Linden.&#34;Linden, what happened to your promise? You said you&#39;d kill Cedric! Yet here he is, alive and well.What do you have to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden shrugged nonchalantly, shaking off the shock. &#34;Sweetheart, why so upset? I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s doctor now. We&#39;ve got all the time in the world.Plenty of ways to finish them both off.&#34; As Linden spoke, his hand reached to Natalie&#39;s waist,attempting to pull her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back, her face twisted in disgust and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s hand hovered awkwardly in midair, frozen in place. &#34;Sweetheart, what&#39;s the matter? Don&#39;t you remember the passion we shared? We&#39;re closer than anyone else in the world now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s mouth parted, ready to lash out with every insult she could think of, but Elyse&#39;s words held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse leaned in, her voice low and controlled for Natalie&#39;s ears alone. &#34;Hold your tongue. He&#39;s right, in a way. As Daniela&#39;s personal doctor, he&#39;ll have plenty of chances to strike. Don&#39;t waste this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbled inside Natalie. &#34;But he&#39;s always trying to take advantage of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shared her revulsion. Linden wasn&#39;t exactly appealing, but she held back a sigh. &#34;Endure it, just for now. In his mind, you two shared something real.Keep him close; we need him on our side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Nina stood, watching the drama unfold with a detached indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile curled on her lips as she turned to Natalie. &#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who said it was nothing more than a physical thing? Since you spent the night with Linden, why act all righteous and harsh now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s temper flared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina turned and walked away with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly followed, her voice sharp with dissatisfaction. &#34;Nina, what was that about? She&#39;s your sister! Don&#39;t be so shortsighted. Daniela&#39;s just a cousin. You&#39;re a Dury, remember? Stick with us, grab her wealth, and you&#39;ll live just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes flickered down to Daniela and Cedric outside the building. She asked, &#34;Do you honestly think I can still live comfortably?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse opened her mouth to respond with a quick &#34;yes,&#34; but Nina&#39;s cold laugh stopped her. &#34;You never cared about my happiness. Why start pretending now? I&#39;ve always been your pawn. If it suited you,you&#39;d discard me in a heartbeat. Natalie&#39;s the one you really want, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those biting words, Nina stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors slid shut, leaving Elyse standing there,her face twisted with cold dissatisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden stepped in front of Natalie, blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used &#34;sweetheart&#34; in a tone far too familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having tasted what he thought was intimacy, his hunger for more grew insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s disgust twisted her stomach, but she forced the words out through gritted teeth, saying,&#34;If you don&#39;t make Cedric pay for hislife, don&#39;t even think about laying a hand on me again. Ever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s gaze traveled over Natalie, his eyes full of unspoken intentions. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll keep my word.&#34; Meanwhile, in the car, Cedric&#39;s fingers remained intertwined with Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The landscape outside blurred into a streak of colors as the car sped onward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to face Daniela, Cedric let his fingers gently brush the back of her hand-a touch both gentle and full of meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at him.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile was unguarded as if the ordeaI of his coma had never touched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his gaze, Daniela could see nothing but warmth and unspoken affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that serene silence, a smile finally spread across Daniela&#39;s face. In Cedric&#39;s presence, she could lower her walls, feeling at peace in a way that no one else allowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey,&#34; Cedric murmured, his voice gentle as a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet hum of the car filled the space between them, and Daniela replied just as gently, &#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up front, the driver couldn&#39;t help but feel like an outsider in their intimate moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car surged forward, completing what should&#39;ve been a twenty-minute journey in barely half the time.</p>
