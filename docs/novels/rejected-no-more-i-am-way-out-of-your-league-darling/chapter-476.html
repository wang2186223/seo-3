                <p>Maureen Phillips was 80 years old, her face radiating a glow of kindness and warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her youth, she worked as a seamstress. After losing her husband, she adopted Cedric and treated him with nothing but kindness, as if hewere her own grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the years, she handcrafted all of Cedric&#39;s andergarments with love and care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her vision had weakened over time,she continued the tradition of sewing these items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric arrived, Maureen welcomed him wvith a warm smile and looked around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela didn&#39;t come with you? Why did you return alone today?&#34; she asked with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric entered and took a seat across from her at the long table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, there&#39;s something I need to ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile lingered on Maureen&#39;s lips. &#34;Go ahead, ask,&#34;she said in a soft, comforting voice, always speaking as though to a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, when you adopted me, did I have anything with me?&#34; Cedric asked. Maureen had always been open about discussing Cedric&#39;s adoption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing his question, she continued to smile gently. &#34;Let me think. Ah, you had a piece of red cloth with what appeared to be a family emblem on it.It was charred by fire, with most of it gone, only the edges remained. After I adopted you, I inquired at the orphanage about it, but they told me it was lost. They showed me only a photo of the damaged emblem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the fading of her memory with age,Maureen&#39;s expertise as a seamstress helped her remember patterns vividly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the emblem on that red cloth, though incomplete, was clearly from a distinguished and wealthy family. I did try to match it withvarious family crests, but the missing parts made identification impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she talked, Maureen began to draw slowly on a sheet of white paper beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she completed the sketch, she handed it to Cedric, her eyes twinkling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This emblem has a distinctive pattern.I still recall it vividly, even after all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric examined the sketch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emblem was indeed largely destroyed, with only about ten percent remaining. The visible part hinted  at a curved shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It resembled the wing of an angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Maureen&#39;s, Cedric headed to Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hired the world&#39;s foremost private investigator and made a personal visit to the orphanage he came from years earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s ongoing donations had significantly helped the orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his arrival, the director personally welcomed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you referring to the red cloth you had as a child?I remember that the material was quite extraordinary.I&#39;d never encountered anything as soft before,similar to that of cashmere or silk. It had an emblem. Our previous director, when he admitted you, suggested your background must be extraordinary. Sadly, the orphanage suffered a fire later, and that piece of cloth was destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;What about the records from that time?Are they still accessible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director stood and said, &#34;I need to search for them.We have a lot of materials, and it&#39;s somewhat disorganized. Recently, some children were playing with fire which nearly caused a major disaster in the archives. It&#39;s quite a mess there now. Cedric, perhaps you should return home and await our update. Once we locate anything, I&#39;ll ensure it is sent  to you.&#34;Cedric nodded in agreement and, before leaving.donated another million dollars to the orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director offered his sincere gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric left, the director organized the entire orphanage staff to search the archives for the records.</p>
