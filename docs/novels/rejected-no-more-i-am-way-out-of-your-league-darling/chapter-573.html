                <p>Daniela settled into her seat, her voice steady.&#34;Winslow Flore. Have you ever come across this name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden replied, &#34;I have, though not in much detail.From what I recall, your mother&#39;s final business deal involved this man. I didn&#39;t concern mnyself with the details, but I do remember that time being particularly windy. His name stuck with me because it sounded like the wind itself. I even told your mother it had a certain ring to it-perhaps that&#39;s why l remember it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained unreadable. &#34;Is there anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all. But I do recall your mother mentioning she had been preparing a major deal with him.I never involved myself in her business matters, so l  didn&#39;t think much of it. After her passing, though,I saw in the news that Winslow had successfully sealed the deal on his own. It skyrocketed his wealth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, a faint furrow forming between her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s everything I know,&#34; Caiden added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made a slight movement, preparing to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden suddenly leaned forward, his tone urgent.&#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t keep me locked away forever.You let Elyse go, didn&#39;t you? Then why not me? I&#39;ve told you everything you wanted to hear. I deserve my freedom too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t spare him another glance. Without a word, she turned on her heel and walked out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped outside, Caiden&#39;s wild screams rang out, carried by the wind, their eerie resonance lingering in the mountains likea ghostly wail. Daniela and Lillian made their way back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car ran low on fuel, Lillian took it to a nearby station to refuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Daniela decided to walk the rest of the way home. Midway through her journey, a sudden awareness prickled at her senses-someone was approaching at an alarming speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, only to be met with Natalie&#39;s bloodstained figure, her expression twisted with menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Natalie&#39;s grip, a dagger gleamed under the dim light as she lunged forward. Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed,poised to counter, when another movement from her side caught her attention-someone else was charging at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second attack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s muscles tensed. Acting on instinct, she intercepted the incoming figure, grasped their arm,and used their own force against them, sending them  tumbling aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that split second, the dagger sliced through the air, aimed, straight at her heart. Daniela pivoted sharply, dodging the lethal strike with precise agility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Nina&#39;s voice rang out as she hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at her, concern flickering in her gaze.&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bracing herself on her hands, Nina pushed up. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a firm nod. &#34;Good. Now, step back a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Nina moved away, putting a safe distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention back to Natalie, Daniela took in the sight-her clothes stained in fresh crimson, her wild demeanor unmistakable. She looked like she had just taken a life.  Behind her, Nina&#39;s voice rang out, sharp and urgent.&#34;Daniela! She killed Linden!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, a faint smile ghosted across Daniela&#39;s lips as she fixed her gaze on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s grip on the dagger tightened, her expression darkening. &#34;What the hell are you smiling at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spoke in a slow, measured tone, her composure unnerving. &#34;Do you even realize where you&#39;re standing right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie instinctively looked down, uncertainty flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice softened, yet her words carried weight. &#34;This is the exact spot where my mother fell to her death. Do you know why, despite all my wealth and properties, I never left this place? Because I was waiting-waiting for this mnoment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted her mother to witness it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone who had played a role in her death would  pay their due price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie narrowed her eyes, suspicion creeping into her voice. &#34;So, you knew all along that I&#39;d come back.You made Linden turn against me. You kept him close, just waiting for the moment I&#39;d return, didn&#39;t you? Daniela, you&#39;re truly ruthless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a light chuckle. &#34;Exactly. Everything played out just as I planned. And now, here you are,right where I wanted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s grip on the dagger tightened, her knuckles turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to Hell!&#34; With a furious cry, Natalie lunged forward, dagger aimed straight at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had just pulled up when he saw something that made his heart nearly stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of him, Natalie was rushing at Daniela, the blade gleaming in her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s breath hitched in his throat.  But before he could react, Daniela&#39;s hand shot up,and in a mere blink, she had Natalie pinned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fear morphed into sheer disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in astonishment, staring at the scene before him, struggling to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Cedric hurriedly jumped out of the car, frantically scanning Daniela from head to toe,searching for any sign of injury. But she was completely unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His entire perception of reality felt slightly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At such close range, you dodged Natalie&#39;s dagger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t wrap his head around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fraction of a second, just a slight shift in angle, and Natalie&#39;s dagger would have pierced Daniela without fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But somehow, Daniela had evaded it.How? &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Are you disappointed that I&#39;m unscathed?&#34; Daniela asked, her tone light but teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I not be?&#34; Cedric muttered, still dazed.&#34;I just can&#39;t figure out how you managed to dodge it like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really have been that effortless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood frozen, watching as Nina helped Daniela inside. Then his gaze drifted back to Natalie,now securely tied up on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he fumbled to call the police, his eyes remained fixed on the knots holding Natalie down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it truly as unbelievable as it seemed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife knew how to fight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible! Absolutely not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife-the same woman who struggled to slice an apple without making a mess-knew how to fight? No  way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explanation seemed reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes. That had to be it. He convinced himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with his own reasoning, Cedric shot Natalie one last glare before turning to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Elyse arrived, the police still hadn&#39;t shown up. She spared Natalie a quick glance before stepping inside in search of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Natalie is already facing serious murder charges. You don&#39;t need to add to it. After all, she is still your cousin. Could you help her by hiring a lawyer? You have top-notch attorneys. If they take on her case, there&#39;s a chance she could avoid a murder conviction.Daniela, you&#39;re the kindest person I know.You wouldn&#39;t hold a grudge against Natalie, right?&#34;</p>
