                <p>Though his heart sank like a stone, Nikolas still asked.&#34;What do you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sinking instinct told him this had to do with Daniela.And he was right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice dropped to a whisper as he told Nikolas, &#34;Daniela has a crippling fear of blood. It&#39;s her Achilles&#39; heel. I need your help...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton drew a chilling line across his throat &#34;She trusts you and Damon. Wait until her guard slips-then you strike, and it&#39;ll be over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas stayed silent for too long, Hamilton took it as fear and rushed to reassure him. &#34;I got this information from Alexander.He said Daniela crumbles at the sight of blood-unless she&#39;s used tranquilizer. You saw how shaken she was last time. Wait until Cedric and Carol are out of the house. Then, burst the blood bag-Daniela&#39;s body will betray her with visible symptoms. This kind of fear runs deeper than willpower; even the strongest can&#39;t fight it. That&#39;s your moment to strike and end her. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton reached into his suit and pulled out a blood bag like a secret weapon. &#34;Keep it on you at all times.and act the moment the opportunity strikes. Nikolas,once Daniela is gone, Cedric&#39;s marriage to her ends by default. Then he can wed the princess of Loglil.Everything rides on your shoulders!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton turned to leave, he gave Nikolas a firm pat on the shoulder. &#34;In this world,survival comes first -or you&#39;ll be crushed under its weight. Don&#39;t let misplaced compassion blur your judgment. You&#39;ve known this since childhood-nothing outranks self-interest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp flick of his suit, Hamilton strode off.exuding unshakable confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at Hamilton&#39;s fading silhouette, then lowered his gaze to the blood bag in his palm-his face a storm of tangled emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela sat watching TV,Carol entered the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned toward Daniela. &#34;Daniela, I saw Hamilton  talking to Nikolas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged. &#34;Hamilton&#39;s his father. It&#39;s not strange for them to meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed her eyes, a flicker of menace dancing within them. &#34;But I saw Hamilton hand Nikolas a blood bag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;Are you sure you saw that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded firmly. &#34;I saw it clearly. Nikolas slipped it into his pocket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the villa door clicked open, and someone stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper glanced up and announced, &#34;Nikolas has returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Carol turned just in time to see Nikolas walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela murmured to Carol,&#34;Noted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol sank into the couch and turned her eyes back to the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas settled onto the long sofa, Daniela wanted to get her laptop. He reached out and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flipped open her laptop and quickly breached Hamilton&#39;s private account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough, a transaction stared back at her-Hamilton had wired fifty million to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Hamilton was so certain about her fear of blood.The pieces now fit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela texted Carol. &#34;Get the tranquilizer ready for me in advance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s expression darkened, and as she turned to leave,she shot Nikolas a venomous glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked genuinely confused. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with Carol? Did I say something to upset her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her laptop. &#34;She missed out on her favorite trending cake. That&#39;s probably what&#39;s bothering her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood up from the sofa. &#34;I&#39;ll go get it for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain poured steadily outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The downpour was relentless. Daniela watched as Nikolas, dressed neatly in his suit, grabbed an umbrella and stepped into the curtain of rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a single glance, then coolly turned her attention back to the TV screen. After a short while, Carol came back and silently placed the tranquilizer beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Nikolas walked in, soaked to the skin from the rain, yet holding the cake box dry and untouched. He handed it to Carol &#34;Here, this is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s face remained cold. Without sparing him a glance,she turned and walked straight to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked in disbelief. &#34;Didn&#39;t she want this cake?Why&#39;s she still mad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela switched off the TV and rose to her feet. &#34;She didn&#39;t like dinner tonight and is sulking, insisting on eating from that busy night market on Main Road.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at the clock. &#34;It&#39;s still early. That market isn&#39;t open yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head slightly. &#34;I don&#39;t know, maybe she had a sudden craving. She&#39;ll get over it. Comne on,let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurried through a few bites, then grabbed the umbrella and headed out to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night market was a bit of a drive, but Carol adored it-and often made the trip herself just to grab a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked confused. &#34;She wants it that bad? Doesn&#39;t that place do delivery? Why not just call them instead of driving there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept eating, her tone even. &#34;Nikolas knows I&#39;m afraid of blood.&#34; She&#39;d never intended to keep it from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fork hit the plate with a loud clatter.&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
