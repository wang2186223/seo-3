                <p>A sudden, sharp pain tore through their stomachs like a punch to the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen and Charles shot to their feet in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, they bolted to the restroom and yanked the door open with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, sprawled across the cold tiles, were Nikolas and Richard-completely drained and barely conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas!&#34; Kohen called out, panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, a disheveled mess on the floor, cracked his eyesopen, barely hanging on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nikolas parted his lips to speak, Kohen clutched his rear and bolted like a lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles wasn&#39;t far behind, scrambling after him in the same sorry state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, chaos ruled the room-then slowly, the madness subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, an ambulance pulled up, hauling away all four of them and putting an end to the messy ordeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, they exploded across the internet, dominating the trending charts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humiliating Moments-Sons of World&#39;s Richest Man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shocking Collapse! McCoy Brothers&#39; Dignity in Shambles!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scandal Unleashed! Dark Secrets of the McCoy Brothers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Billionaires&#39; Eating Habits Raise Eyebrows Worldwide!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presence of the world&#39;s richest man sent the news viral-national headlines turned global, even sparking chatter across Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humiliating fallout of the three brothers became an international spectacle. They gorged themselves into oblivion and collapsed from diarrhea-what a global embarrassment for the McCoy family!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the clueless outsider, it looked as if the McCoy brothers had never seen real food before in their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of flashing cameras, Daniela spoke with regret. &#34;I truly didn&#39;t expect the McCoy family&#39;s dining etiquette to be so lacking. Over thirty dishes for three men-it&#39;s no wonder they had stomach trouble.1sincerely hope Hamilton can provide his sons with better meals in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was not one to give interviews lightly. So when she did speak-graceful, composed, and with genuine concern-everyone believed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a final smile, she exited the private room with elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked past the front desk, the manager met her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager bowed slightly and said respectfully, &#34;Boss, take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a calm nod, then turned to the manager in front of the buzzing reporters. &#34;Even though the McCoy brothers were hosting tonight, considering the circumstances, I&#39;ll be footing the bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras clicked as reporters eagerly captured the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The public was full of praise. &#34;Ms. Harper is a picture of grace. Even after tonight&#39;s humiliation, she&#39;s shown nothing but generosity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small smile and stepped into her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters didn&#39;t miss a beat, snapping every frame they could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pictures showed her turning back with a final, charming smile before slipping inside the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Daniela&#39;s public image skyrocketed-riding the wave of the McCoy family&#39;s humiliation, she won the hearts of thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her car rolled to a quiet stop outside her home, her phone began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the screen, then answered with a calm swipe. A voice came through-deep,weathered with time, laced with a knowing smile. &#34;Ms. Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze toward Cedric seated beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she quietly stepped out of the car and whispered to Cedric,&#34;1need to take this call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric simply assumed it was business-he never meddled in her corporate affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,with a nod, he and Carol made their way into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once alone, Daniela&#39;s voice turned cool and steady. &#34;Mr. McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled, short and dry. &#34;We&#39;re all family, aren&#39;t we? Don&#39;t you think you were a little too ruthless tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the villa&#39;s garden, encircled by the soft bloom of flowers Cedric had lovingly planted,Daniela drew in a breath of the faint, calming scent. A deep sense of ease settled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ruthless?&#34; Daniela echoed, her tone unbothered. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a knowing chuckle. &#34;Sounds like Cedric means a lot to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;He does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with those three missing years, Cedric still held a place that couldn&#39;t be shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hadn&#39;t expected her to be so candid. He thought Daniela would mask her feelings and act indifferent toward Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled, this time almost fondly. &#34;That&#39;s good. Come visit Oiscoll sometime-we&#39;ll share a meal.You&#39;ll enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was sharper, cutting through the pleasantries. &#34;I don&#39;t like Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile faltered. People didn&#39;t turn down invitations from the richest man in the world. Not even someone like Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Hamilton knew how to bide his time with valuable people. &#34;Very well, come when it suits you. I&#39;Il entrust my three idiotic sons to you in the meantime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression didn&#39;t shift. Through the tall window panes, she spotted Cedric at the counter,preparing juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Cedric quietly, she said coldly, &#34;Mr. McCoy, if you truly care about your sons, call them back before they embarrass themselves further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was the only one who ever dared speak to Hamilton so bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s silence was heavy-Daniela caught the subtle hiss of his strained breath through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard it, but remained unfazed. &#34;Well then, goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call and turned back to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her hand reached the doorknob, Cedric swung the door open with a smile, offering her a glass of juice. &#34;Here-this should top up your vitamins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela accepted it and took a sip without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,pleased,turned back to the kitchen. Carol appeared, watching him with amusement. &#34;I&#39;ve never met a man who enjoys the kitchen this much-he&#39;s practically a homemaker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned in, voice hushed. &#34;Lone Wolf is also looking for Winslow.&#34;</p>
