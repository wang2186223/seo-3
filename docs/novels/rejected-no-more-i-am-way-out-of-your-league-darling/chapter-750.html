                <p>The McCoy family&#39;s banquet was nothing short of a lavish spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Past the mountains of food and endless drinks, there were games, contests, and amusements at every turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shared a quick look with a few others before his eyes landed on Cedric&#39;s injured leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin curled at Nikolas&#39; mouth as he called out, &#34;The weather&#39;s perfect today. How about a little horse race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone caught on right away. That jab was aimed straight at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the explosion, Cedric&#39;s leg had never fully healed. Even though it looked better now, he was still nowhere near strong enough to ride a horse, let alone race one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The horses in the stables were known for their fiery tempers, loyal only to their own riders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear as day that Nikolas was setting Cedric up to be humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas spoke loud enough to turn every head at the banquet. Even a few reporters started drifting closer,sniffing out a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, swirling the wine in her glass, gave Hamilton a sideways glance. &#34;Mr. McCoy, your son is already making a fool of himself. Should I step in and remind him how to behave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile, Hamilton answered, &#34;Go ahead.I won&#39;t stop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a light nod. &#34;Fine then. I&#39;ll do you a favor and teach your son some manners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting, she walked toward the center of the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved, she caught Nikolas speaking into the microphone, his voice bouncing off the walls.′′My father said Cedric is one of us now. Cedric, come race with us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clutched the mic like he was holding a trophy, making sure nobody missed the show. He wanted everyone to see Cedric&#39;s bad leg. He wanted the shame to stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right when the crowd&#39;s eyes began sliding toward Cedric&#39;s leg, Daniela stepped up beside Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the microphone with a bright, easy smile. &#34;My husband&#39;s a modest man. He doesn&#39;t like showing off. He believes it&#39;s better to spare the McCoy family too much embarrassment, and I happen to agree. But I wouldn&#39;t want to spoil everyone&#39;s fun either. Since Cedric was the one who taught me to ride, I&#39;ll be racing with you all instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked down at Daniela. She barely reached his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; he sneered. &#34;Just make sure you don&#39;t start bawling when you lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen jumped in with a sneer of his own. &#34;There&#39;s no glory in beating a woman. Let Cedric race!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles kept his lips pressed tight, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shouted from the side, &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t run off crying later and say we bullied you if you lose. That would just be pathetic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran threw his head back and burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd followed, eager for the drama about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone leaned closer to Daniela and whispered, &#34;Maybe you should sit this one out. These men practically live at the stables. They know what they&#39;re doing. You&#39;re small. You&#39;re not built like them. If you get thrown off that wild horse, you could break something-or worse. It&#39;s not worth it just to prove a point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice chimed in, low and wary, &#34;Yeah. Think about it. If something terrible happens, it&#39;s not just personal. It&#39;ll drag down the McCoy family&#39;s stock prices too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, someone hollered toward Nikolas. &#34;Alright, that&#39;s enough! Come back and eat. If anything bad happens, your father won&#39;t let you off easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas curled his lip in a cold sneer. &#34;My father&#39;s been quiet so far. That means he&#39;s fine with it. It&#39;s just a horse ride. What could go wrong? If you&#39;re scared, Daniela, go ahead and pick the tamest horse you can find,&#34; he said, voice dripping with contempt. Daniela only smiled, refusing to waste her breath on an argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every McCoy family member had their own horse, but Nikolas didn&#39;t even pretend to give her a fair shot.He led out a massive, wild stallion straight from the area where they kept the fiercest, untamed horse. This one had never been broken by anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground trembled under the stallion&#39;s hooves, and the beast&#39;s nostrils flared as it snorted heavy, angry breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone watching, it felt like the opening move of a dangerous duel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One reporter with a sharp eye pointed and said, &#34;Look at its eyes! They&#39;re red!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A horse with red eyes meant trouble. It meant only a true professional had any hope of staying on its back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd instinctively stepped away, murmuring under their breath. &#34;The McCoy brothers are vicious.Even they can&#39;t control that monster, and they expect her to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard it took more than fifty people just to catch that horse in the wild,&#34; someone said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at those cuts on its legs. It&#39;s at its most dangerous now. Even expert trainers would keep their distance or risk being thrown clear across the field,&#34; another voice warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the yard, the McCoy brothers exchanged sly,cruel smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared down at Daniela and asked, his voice thick with arrogance, &#34;Well, Daniela, still want to give it a try?&#34;</p>
