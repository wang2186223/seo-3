                <p>The rumors online were spreading rapidly, each update adding more fuel to the fire. It seemed as if unseen hands were stoking the gossip, making it burn even brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder people say being a stepmother is a challenge. And even her biological daughter doesn&#39;t have it easy either. Daniela must be the mastermind behind the fire incident, trying to take Joyce out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Did you hear that Daniela is indulging in some fancy private hospital room that costs six grand a night? Her father and stepmother are at her beck and call, and her husband&#39;s there, peeling fruit for her like she&#39;s some queen. Meanwhile, poor Joyce is crammed into a room with five others, struggling even to get water!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No doubt about it-Daniela must have everything handed to her on a silver platter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Daniela got out of the hospital already,but Joyce is still laid up there. I heard Joyce ended up with a broken rib and a scar on her face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor Joyce! Daniela&#39;s absolutely despicable! Justbecause she&#39;s the biological daughter, does she deserve royal treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the swirling vortex of distorted rumors, one comment in the online chaos stood out, shedding a different light on the situation. &#34;I&#39;m sharing a ward with five others at Northpoint Hospital, and Daniela was here with us. HHonestly, she&#39;s a genuinely nice person-beautiful, kind, and nothing like the spoiled heiress everyone makes her out to be. It&#39;s her husband who&#39;s the real piece of work!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This comment was soon engulfed by a wave of dismissive responses, with critics sneeringly accusing Daniela of paying people to spread falsehoods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The netizens jeered, dismissing the accusation as absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, too, caught sight of the comment and huffed derisively, &#34;Ridiculous! Daniela is a celebrated fashion titan, the visionary behind Elite Lux. If she hadn&#39;t thrown her future away on that scoundrel, she&#39;d top the list of the world&#39;s wealthiest. What right do these nobodies have to judge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela remained unfazed by the online uproar, finding Lillian&#39;s indignant expression somewhat amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously laughing, Daniela? You&#39;re going to let these keyboard warriors hired by Joyce defame you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held up her phone, the recording on full display, and smirked. &#34;Definitely not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes popped wide open in surprise.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing her phone back into her pocket, Daniela declared nonchalantly, &#34;I&#39;ve decided-it&#39;s time to file for a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke with a chilling calmness, her voice devoid of any trace of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s mouth fell open in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a playful grin, Daniela nudged Lillian&#39;s chin up.&#34;Have the legal department prepare a divorce agreement for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gleam of excitement flashed across Lillian&#39;s face.&#34;Are you for real? You&#39;re not joking,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nearly leaped from her chair, her eyes wide with disbelief. &#34;You&#39;ve actually come to your senses? I was starting to think you&#39;d let that piece of trash ruin you forever.&#34; Lillian put her hand over her heart in an exaggerated gesture, which elicited a burst of laughter from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was I really that hopeless before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression turned earnest as she nodded vigorously. &#34;Absolutely. You were lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a chuckle, reflecting on her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, she had been consumed by love for Alexander for ten long years, an entire decade lost in hopeless yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For his slightest attention, she had repeatedly humbled herself, longing for even a sliver of his affection.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by Daniela&#39;s newfound realization, Lillian wiped away a tear and reached out to the company&#39;s legal team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer, sleeves rolled up and ready for action,inquired seriously, &#34;What compensation do you seek from Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed, icy gaze, Daniela replied firmly,&#34;I don&#39;t want his damned money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34; Lillian affirmed with a nod. Daniela had faced the world on her own terms since she lost her mother at the tender age of five. Over the years, she crafted a successful brand that catapulted her into a billionaire status long before she reached adulthood. The thought of needing anything from Alexander was almost comical to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who scorned Daniela were foolish, thinking she was cut from the same weak cloth as Joyce-a woman with no ambition, content to cling to her family and wait for marrying into a rich family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How utterly ridiculous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After departing from the hospital, Daniela promptly reached out to Alexander,her determination unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang several times before his secretary picked up with a sniff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela? What is it this time?&#34; the secretary asked,his voice dripping with condescension. He was well aware of Alexander&#39;s disregard for Daniela and didn&#39;t bother to mask his own contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to speak with Alexander,&#34; Daniela replied, her voice steady and accustomed to the dismissive attitudes of those employed by Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary cast a glance towards Alexander, who was currently engaged in a close conversation with Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce seemed to be almost attached to Alexander,her body leaning into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett is currently in a meeting,&#34; the secretary lied smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela responded, &#34;Tell him to meet me at the courthouse at eight tomorrow morning. We&#39;re finalizing the divorce.&#34;</p>
