                <p>&#34;Cedric, does Daniela even realize how mean you are?&#34; Alexander shouted, voice rising like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe she doesn&#39;t. But your incompetence? That&#39;s one thing she knows all too well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nearly choked on his anger. &#34;You&#39;re just the richest man in the country. What gives you the right to be so damn smug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smirked, unbothered. &#34;Smug? Of course I am.Before leaving, Daniela handed me a fortune worth tens of billions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tilted his head, feigning confusion. &#34;Wait,didn&#39;t you marry Daniela once? Just curious-what did she leave you when she divorced you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question jabbed straight into Alexander&#39;s unhealed wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Olisvine and throughout the business world, it was no secret-Daniela had handed Elite Lux to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So naturally, peopole kept pestering Alexander-what had Daniela given him in the divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw tight, fury sealing his lips shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, he couldn&#39;t form a comeback. He could only scoff coldly. &#34;Only a pathetic man expects something from a woman after a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a mocking laugh. &#34;Really? Then where is the inheritance Doug left for Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That particular shame had long slipped from Alexander&#39;s mind. No one had dared bring it up around him until Cedric casually tossed it out. Rage ignited instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Alexander snapped, his tone turning sharp.&#34;Daniela&#39;s gone. No matter what she handed you, the fact remains-she left you behind. She didn&#39;t stick around for either of us. One word from her and you&#39;re stuck here, just like me. You&#39;re no different-just another piece she discarded. She&#39;s done with you. Once Daniela makes up her mind, there&#39;s no going back. She won&#39;t return to you. I&#39;ve begged her more times than I can count. I repented again and again.I even reshaped myself to look like you, but in the end,she still turned her back on me. Daniela plays the game with precision-calculated, untouchable. Now that she&#39;s aligned herself with someone stronger,she&#39;s cast you aside too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hurled his words like daggers, sharp and merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twisted sense of relief washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never imagined the day would come when Cedric would be caught in the same storm he once endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter burst from him-wild, mocking,laced with smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Joyce sought Cedric out. &#34;Will you help me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric already understood what she was after. &#34;This isn&#39;t about me-it&#39;s for Jack,&#34; she added.&#34;What Alexander has should&#39;ve been mine. Apart from Daniela, you&#39;re the only one who can help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had schemed for ages, yet still had empty hands. But the bitterness refused to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Fairburne Group has merged with Bennett Group now, and the financial details are all tangled.But back then, Doug owned assets worth billions.I can&#39;t stomach being pushed out like I never mattered. Cedric, I&#39;m asking for your help-for Jack&#39;s sake, the one Daniela once held dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of her earlier words carried the weight of her final plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Cedric answered with calm restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce exhaled, a faint smile curling on her lips.&#34;Cedric, if I ever get the chance, I swear I&#39;ll repay you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. As he climbed the stairs, he said flatly, &#34;You owe me nothing. I&#39;m not doing this for you.&#34; And in that moment, Joyce understood. It was all because of Daniela. Back then, Daniela had been willing to help Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela left, she didn&#39;t just hand over her fortune to Cedric-she also made sure Jack had a school and money for his future. Beyond that, she left no other strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the echo of her own loss that made her care so deeply for Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Joyce realized Cedric probably wasn&#39;t doing this for her-or even for Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric just needed to hold on to whatever thread of Daniela remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Oiscoll, Daniela received a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar voice played in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not waiting for her,&#34; it said.</p>
