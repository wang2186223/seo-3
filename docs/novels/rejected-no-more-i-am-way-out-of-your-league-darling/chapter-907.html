                <p>Hamilton exhaled sharply, frustration etched across his face. &#34;What kind of hold does Daniela have on all of you? Even now, she&#39;s still at the center of your thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said nothing, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion flared in Hamilton&#39;s eyes as he recalled his secretary&#39;s report-Nikolas and Carol&#39;s relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice lowered, taking on a grave tone. &#34;Whatever chaos is swirling around us, you&#39;re still a McCoy.When it comes down to it, I&#39;ll always put you and Damon first. Are you even aware of how severe Mason&#39;s injuries are? Both hands-completely shattered. And below the belt... the doctor says he&#39;ll never recover. He&#39;s lost everything. Do you understand the consequences? In families like ours,continuing the bloodline is everything. Mason&#39;s finished. His father will stop at nothing to get back at Daniela and Carol. If you  stay there, you&#39;ll be dragged right into their war. As your father, I&#39;m not giving you a choice. Take Damon and Cedric, and leave Daniela&#39;s place right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused before adding,&#34;Listen closely-this isn&#39;t up for debate. You&#39;re going to do exactly as I say, no questions, no arguments. Josh&#39;s men will make their move.tonight. You know his reputation-he doesn&#39;t gamble, doesn&#39;t chase women. All he cares about is that little army of killers he&#39;s trained to follow his every word. When they come, they&#39;ll show no mercy.Daniela won&#39;t stand a chance. One hour from now,my car will pull up outside the house. When it does, I want Cedric disguised and out the door with you.Josh gave his word-leave before nightfall, and he&#39;l let you walk. So get moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead with a sharp click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat there, motionless on the edge of the sofa,unease flickering across his features. He hadn&#39;t bothered to call Damon-there was no point. The house felt emptier than usual, shadows stretching along the walls as silence settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared at the top of the stairs, footsteps barely making a sound. As he descended, Nikolas finally glanced up, the strain in his eyes impossible to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow creased, catching the distress etched on Nikolas&#39; face. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas raked a hand through his hair, frustration crackling in his voice. &#34;Why did you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep line formed between Cedric&#39;s brows. &#34;Do what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; voice was tight with frustration. &#34;Look, even if Mason is a complete scumbag, sooner or later someone would&#39;ve taken care of him. Was it really worth ticking off his father for his sake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Daniela&#39;s voice floated down, calling for Cedric to fetch something for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t respond to Nikolas. He turned around and climbed the stairs wwithout hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Carol stepped out of her room and caught the tail end of Nikolas&#39; question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Nikolas spotted Carol, he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol moved past him without a word, her face a blank mask. She picked up the remote and switched on the TV, letting the flicker of the screen fill the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas dragged a hand through his hair, frustration etched across his features. &#34;If I&#39;d known, I never would&#39;ve told Daniela about what Mason did-about all the girls he hurt. That&#39;s what pushed her over the edge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol took a sip of water, set her glass down with a soft clink, and finally responded, &#34;That might be why Daniela went after Mason, but it&#39;s not why Cedric and I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a chill in her words, a razor-sharp clarity that reminded Nikolas so much of Daniela it sent a  shiver down his spine. Both women radiated that same icy, unyielding resolve..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she added, &#34;Cedric and I lashed out because of the filthy things Mason said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at her, stunned. &#34;But Daniela&#39;s tougher than that. Words like his-she wouldn&#39;t care.How could anything he said possibly get to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol settled deeper into the sofa, absently flipping through TV channels, her features unreadable in the flickering light. &#34;It didn&#39;t faze her. But Cedric and |couldn&#39;t just let it go. She&#39;s my friend, someone l admire, and she&#39;s Cedric&#39;s wife. That mnatters to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, meeting Nikolas&#39; gaze. &#34;Have you ever cared about anyone that deeply?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol continued, &#34;I don&#39;t think you have. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll never get it. People with different values can&#39;t work together. End of story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence descended, broken only by the low hum of the TV. Half an hour slipped by before Nikolas, still troubled, finally rose and headed for his room. Just before stepping inside, he cast one last glance back at Carol, who remained perfectly composed, her expression so serene it bordered on apathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He disappeared into his room, the door closing quietly behind him. Only a few minutes passed before a sudden knock rattled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stood in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;What are you doing back here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon retorted, &#34;How could I just sit back with all this going on? So, what&#39;s the plan? And why are you packing? Are we all making a run for it?&#34;</p>
