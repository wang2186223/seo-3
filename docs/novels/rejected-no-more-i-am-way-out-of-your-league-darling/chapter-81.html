                <p>Richard&#39;s face became a mask of complexity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina slammed her hand down on the table, pointing furiously at Ronald&#39;s wife across from her. &#34;What absurdity is this? How dare you suggest such a thing? Joyce doesn&#39;t even have a boyfriend. How could she possibly be pregnant? She has given her whole heart to Alexander. She&#39;s one of a kind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt sure that everything was aligning perfectly. But then, an unexpected twist threw her plans into disarray.How could she contain her anger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scowled, gearing up to press her agenda with Richard, when he suddenly stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a courteous smile, Richard addressed Katrina. &#34;Given that Joyce seems unwell, perhaps it&#39;s best we cut this dinner short. Katrina, I appreciate your sentiments, but these matters should really be left to the younger ones to decide. There&#39;s no need to rush. Indeed, a young woman&#39;s best years are valuable, and careful consideration is essential. Should there truly be a suitable match for Joyce, we would wholeheartedly give our blessings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was stunned. She scrambled for words to defend Joyce, but Richard had already turned to Alexander, signaling their departure. &#34;Alexander, let&#39;s head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina and Caiden saw them off, Katrina hurried to clarify to Richard. &#34;Please understand. Joyce ate something cold earlier, which upset her stomach. Please, forgive this misunderstanding. You&#39;re absolutely right-finding true love is essential, and I firmly believe Alexander is perfect for Joyce. Now that Daniela is out of the picture, nothing should stand in their way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping pace with Richard&#39;s strides, Katrina struggled in her high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard paused only to offer a parting word before climbing into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, I&#39;ve taken in everything you&#39;ve said. The young people indeed seem well-suited, but if Joyce is indeed feeling unwell, perhaps a doctor&#39;s visit would be prudent, just to rule out any concerns. Only then can we all truly rest easy,don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina fully grasped the weight of Richard&#39;s parting words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the Harper and Bennett families to successfully unite, Joyce couldn&#39;t be pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Caiden maintained their smiles as they bid Richard and Alexander farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as soon as their car disappeared from view, Katrina&#39;s suppressed fury resurfaced. She stormed back into the private dining room and struck Ronald&#39;s wife across the face. &#34;You fool! What rubbish are you spouting? Just because you&#39;ve had a child, you think you know better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s wife heId her cheek, her voice meek. &#34;I was merely making conversation. I never imagined Richard would take it to heart.Besides, if Joyce isn&#39;t pregnant, it&#39;s merely a jest. Why such a harsh reaction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina found herself gasping for air, overwhelmed by frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else interjected, &#34;Exactly, if Joyce isn&#39;t really pregnant, what&#39;s the harm in the comment? Why the outrage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, humiliated by the public spectacle, challenged Katrina. &#34;You&#39;re overstepping, Katrina! Remember,before you married Caiden, you were just a street vendor. Now you lord over us as if you&#39;ve always been above us. Control your daughter better! I&#39;m convinced Joyce is pregnant. She&#39;s unmarried and bringing disgrace upon our family. Like mother, like daughter! You&#39;re no better than Caiden&#39;s first wife. Joyce is far worse than Daniela ever was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comparison to Daniela&#39;s mother infuriated Katrina more than anything else. She pointed furiously towards the exit. &#34;Get out! All of you, get out now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald protected his wife, his sneer cutting through the tension.this your party, or does it belong to the Harpers? Who are you to order us around? If you&#39;re so confident, have Caiden disown us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina closed he eyes, overwhelmed by the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce reappeared from the restroom looking worse for wear. She felt dizzy and her elegant dress was ruined, damp and clinging awkwardly. Her hair was unkempt, adding to her disheveled appearance. &#34;Mom, where&#39;s Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, the room had emptied, the relatives having departed in a wave of moral outrage. Katrina, left with the aftermath,&#39;slammed her hand on the table in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her meticulous arrangements had come to nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Joyce&#39;s changed appearance and considering her recent nausea, Caiden suggested, &#34;She&#39;s gained some weight and her stomach&#39;s upset. We should probably take her to the hospital for a checkup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s naivety was almost legendary. While everyone else understood the underlying tension, he alone took Katrina&#39;s word at face value, believing Joyce had merely eaten something disagreeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive home, Caiden sat upfront, the picture of oblivious contentment. Katrina, meanwhile, was a storm of thought in the back seat,her mind whirling with plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once home, while Caiden retired upstairs, Katrina detained Joyce in the living room, fixing her with an intense,scrutinizing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, emphasizing each word, she demanded,&#34;Are you pregnant?&#34;</p>
