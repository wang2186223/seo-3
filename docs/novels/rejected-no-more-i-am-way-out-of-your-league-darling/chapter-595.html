                <p>A few people lingered at the hospital entrance, awaiting the arrival of their driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley glanced around at the group and suddenly asked, &#34;Why isn&#39;t Marcus here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he spoken than Hackett&#39;s eyes darted briefly, then he ventured, &#34;Maybe he overslept or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley squinted skeptically. &#34;No way. He&#39;s been buried in preparations for his daughter&#39;s wedding. Just yesterday, he mentioned to me that once Huey is discharged from the hospital, they&#39;ll go poublic with the wedding news uniting their two families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s eyebrows shot up, taken aback. &#34;Should we swing by Marcus&#39; place to check on him then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley shook his head. &#34;No, he&#39;s probably just swamped. We can visit Cedric without him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett waved his hand dismissively. &#34;Come on, Farley. We always tackle these things together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, overhearing the exchange, was perplexed. &#34;Hackett, you usually prefer to take charge and always say Marcus is too rash. What&#39;s with the sudden change today? You&#39;re actually pushing to go get Marcus and even suggesting we stop by his place? That&#39;s out of character for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face darkened, and he retorted sharply, &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you all ganging up on me now? Fine! If everything I say is wrong, let&#39;s just go find Cedric and get it over with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he finished his tirade, the car rolled up in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley opened his mouth to reply, but before he could speak, their phones began to ring simultaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley answered his call, and through the speaker poured the distraught sobs of Marcus&#39; daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Farley, hurry. My dad&#39;s dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck them like a thunderbolt, leaving everyone frozen in shock. Farley&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad disappeared last night, and this morning they found him dead outside the back door of Daniela&#39;s office building!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s phone slipped from his hand and crashed to the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett exclaimed, &#34;Daniela is the culprit. She murdered Marcus! Do you all believe me now? Daniela&#39;s evil!Yesterday, she had Cedric try to take out Huey, and when that failed, she went after Marcus the same night.She&#39;s ruthless. She knew Marcus and Huey were about to strengthen their families with that wedding and got scared of the alliance, so she took him out. Do you get it now? I was serious about protecting Huey yesterday, but Cedric shoved me aside. They&#39;re trying to tear us apart, and if you can&#39;t see that, you&#39;re blind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words, charged with conviction, left Farley and the others dazed. For a moment, they wondered if they had misjudged Hackett all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett observed their hesitant expressions and smirked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; death at Daniela&#39;s company soon dominated the headlines in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had an opinion about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela remained indifferent, convinced that these people were merely tearing each other apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander entered, Daniela was absorbed in the latest news updates on TV. He blurted out without preamble, &#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve got to stop this now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, taken aback, demanded, &#34;How did you get in here? Where&#39;s Lillian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander explained, &#34;There&#39;s a swarm of reporters downstairs at Elite Lux. Lillian&#39;s managing them, and I sneaked up here amidst the chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned icy. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34; she inquired, scrutinizing Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lied to him about his face last time, but today something was seriously wrong with his face. &#34;Have you noticed your face looks kind of lopsided?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had rushed over in such a panic that he hadn&#39;t bothered to conceal his face. Mortified, he wished he could disappear. &#34;I can handle it,&#34; he replied, reaching for a tissue to cover his face. &#34;I came to tell you to stop. You can&#39;t take on Hackett and his crew. Look at Marcus&#39; death and Huey&#39;s suicide attempt. Someone&#39;s pulling the strings here. Quit now, and I can still vouch for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t in the mood for a chat. &#34;If that&#39;s all, I&#39;d like you to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s frustration grew. &#34;Why do you always dismiss me? This isn&#39;t just some business war anymore.It&#39;s life or death. Do you think I&#39;d bother saying this if I didn&#39;t care about you? Daniela, think it over. I&#39;m not like those yes-men who just nod along. I&#39;m the one who truly has your back. When will you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By&#34;yes-men,&#34; Alexander clearly meant Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed, her tone sharp and defensive.′′Cedric is my husband. Anyone who disparages him is my enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face fell, a mixture of hurt and disappointment washing over him. &#34;Daniela, you still won&#39;t forgive me? It&#39;s been ages. Do you still hold a grudge for how I ignored you back then? I&#39;ve been trying to make amends. Doesn&#39;t that count for something? Haven&#39;t you noticed how hard I&#39;ve been working to set things right? Daniela, you know this. No matter who I was with, my heart&#39;s always belonged to you.&#34;</p>
