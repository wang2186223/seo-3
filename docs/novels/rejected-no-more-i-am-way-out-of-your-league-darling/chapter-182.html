                <p>After pondering for a moment, Keith slowly shook his head. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated, his hand frozen mid-air, holding his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith distinctly observed a fleeting look of discomfort cross Alexander&#39;s face after a brief moment of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? After a breakup, aren&#39;t you supposed to move on as if you never knew each other?&#34; Alexander queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith shook his head once more.&#34;If you truly loved someone, turning into strangers isn&#39;t an option. There was a time when your heart genuinely skipped a beat for her, and you earnestly wanted to be together.Unless it was all a facade, how could you so easily cast aside someone who once meant so much? Even if you&#39;re apart, the moment you reunite, the old sparks will reignite. Seeing the one you love again is akin to reliving the exhilaration of falling in love over and over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a deep draught from his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith continued, &#34;There are only two scenarios when you treat a past love like a stranger-either you loved too deeply and hid your feelings well, or you never truly fell in love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith noticed that after his last words, Alexander&#39;s face turned pale for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, looking intently into Keith&#39;s eyes, posed his question. &#34;If someone claimed to have loved you for ten years but then behaved as though she never cared, do you think she&#39;s hiding her feelings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith paused, momentarily hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recognized he had presented two possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Alexander focusing solely on what he wished to hear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on Keith that Alexander was reflecting on his own situation. He offered some advice. &#34;Alexander, that&#39;s all behind you. Why linger on it? Daniela appears to be happy now, especially with Cedric. Did you ever think perhaps Cedric is the one she was meant to find in her youth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, Keith felt a sudden, tight grip around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face darkened, his eyes turning icy as he stared at Keith like an enemy. &#34;I warned you!&#34; he declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith struggled to breathe as Alexander tightened his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned you! Never mention that Cedric is the man Daniela always wanted to meet,&#34; Alexander seethed,oblivious to the veins popping on Keith&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith felt as though he was on the brink of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frantically, he nodded, patting Alexander&#39;s arm in desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to black out from the lack of oxygen, Alexander released his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith doubled over, racked with coughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, he saw Alexander leaving the bar with a menacing aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith massaged his neck, whispering to himself, &#34;Didn&#39;t you claim to have no feelings for Daniela? What&#39;s with the heartbroken expression now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s car tore down the street, driven by a single urgent thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to see Daniela immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He planned to tell her that he accepted her love and that she no longer needed to conceal her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was watching TV when Alexander, smelling strongly of alcohol, stormed into her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rose, positioning himself protectively in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight ignited fury in Alexander&#39;s eyes. He stared at them, convinced Cedric was seizing the moment for his advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsteady and intoxicated, Alexander looked past Cedric and fixed his gaze on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a question for you,&#34;he stated.</p>
