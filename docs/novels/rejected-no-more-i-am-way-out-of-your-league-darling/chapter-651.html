                <p>Joyce stirred from a deep slumber, her voice echoing down the stairs as she called, &#34;Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called his name again and again, but silence answered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging it off,she poured herself a glass of milk and grabbed a slice of bread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Tasha,she askedoffhandedly,&#34;Where&#39;s Jack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha answered, &#34;He&#39;s in the garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce halted mid-bite. &#34;Huh? The garden? He hates it there complains the flowers stink and the paths are a nightmare to walk on. Why would he go on his own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha clarified, &#34;He didn&#39;t go alone. Miss Harper took him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce blinked in surprise before a slow, knowing smirk curved her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela can have all the money in the world, but she can&#39;t have her own children. She acts like Jack doesn&#39;t matter to her, yet here she is, sweet-talking him into a morning stroll in the garden. She&#39;s definitely trying hard to win Jack over. Jack has never  been a fan of the garden. The one time I asked him to walk with me, he complained the entire time, and no matter what I did, I couldn&#39;t lift his mood. Jack&#39;s spoiled, sure, but that&#39;s just how it is. He was born under a lucky star-my son, destined to have all eyes on him from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Caiden descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to Caiden with a gleeful grin. &#34;Dad,wasn&#39;t Daniela acting all ruthless yesterday? Well,guess what? This morning, she actually convinced Jack to take a stroll in the garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stifled a laugh behind her hand, utterly amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden arched a skeptical brow. &#34;He actually went?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden spoke up right away. &#34;Daniela must&#39;ve really put in the work. Last time I tried getting Jack to walk with me in the garden, he flat-out refused. I had to bribe him with ten grand just to get five lousy minutes out of himn. The second those five minutes were up,he bolted right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce checked the time and let out a mocking laugh.&#34;It&#39;s been over an hour! At this rate, Daniela&#39;s probably on her knees begging Jack to stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden roared with laughter. Jack had been a meat lover since childhood, and even at a young age, doctors were already warning about his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce and Caiden had tried getting Jack to take walks after meals, but the pudgy little thing was too lazy-even being carried outside wasn&#39;t enough to convince him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha eyed the two of them basking in their smugness,tempted to mention that Jack had stepped out on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even passed Daniela her shoes on his way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she decided to keep that to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack never liked walking, and considering how long he&#39;d been outside, maybe Daniela really had talked him into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Carol made her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had wanted to crash in the guest room last night,but Daniela had shut that down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had walked off looking downright pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stretched, stifling a yawn as she asked Tasha,&#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha opened her mouth to answer, but Joyce cut in with a smug grin. &#34;She convinced Jack to go for a walk in the garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-asleep, Carol muttered a groggy&#34;Okay&#34; and plopped down for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce slid in beside her, her excitement bubbling.&#34;Did you catch that? Daniela actually got Jack to go for a walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded lazily. &#34;He&#39;s a little chubby. Walking&#39;s good for him, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce huffed, unimpressed by her lack of enthusiasm.&#34;Ugh, that&#39;s not the point! The point is she put in real effort to convince him. You should be treating me and Jack with more respect. Can&#39;t you see? Daniela cares about him a lot. She knows she can&#39;t have kids, which means all that money of hers? It&#39;s going straight to Jack. So, you might as well start treating Jack like your future boss. Got it? Oh, and I pulled Jack out of that public school. Hurry up and find him a new school. Regular elementary schools aren&#39;t an option -I won&#39;t allow it. He needs a school where the tuition runs in the millions. If not, don&#39;t come complaining when I refuse to send him anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was just about to question her sanity when the villa door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped inside, and Joyce tilted her head,spotting Jack trailing right behind her. Joyce had been ready to greet them with a smile.but then she froze-Jack, her usually wild little troublemaker, was bending down, pulling out a pair of slippers for Daniela. He grabbed his own as well and slipped them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening up, he asked in a polite tone, &#34;Daniela,are you going for a walk tomorrow? Can I come with you again?&#34;</p>
