            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression darkened as she sharply withdrew her hand from Elyse&#39;s grip. &#34;Mom, you need to own up to your actions. It&#39;s unfair to offload your responsibilities onto your daughter, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was visibly shaken by the confrontation, rooted to the spot.&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, I&#39;ve informed Daniela about everything,&#34; Natalie responded in a composed voice. &#34;I&#39;ve realízed something important. It&#39;s futile to contend with someone more powerful. Daniela is far too intelligent and cunning for us; we are but insects to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let go of Natalie&#39;s hand. &#34;Did you really tell her everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie affirmed with a nod. &#34;Yes, I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry creased Elyse&#39;s face. &#34;What about Mr. Perry and the others? Did you mention them too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of contempt, Natalie answered, &#34;Why should we protect their secrets? They ignored us when we needed help. Why not leverage the truth to our advantage with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice shook with fear. &#34;Natalie, that&#39;s dangerous! Don&#39;t you understand what they&#39;re capable of doing for money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sneered, brushing off her concerns. &#34;I&#39;m not worried about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion was evident on Elyse&#39;s face, which seemed to have aged significantly. &#34;What did Daniela offer you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, a mix of emotions flashed through Natalie&#39;s eyes at the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several moments slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered casually, &#34;Nothing much. Daniela agreed to let me study abroad. Oh, and she returned the villa we used to own. While I&#39;m gone, you&#39;ll have to manage on your own.&#34; At this, Elyse grasped Natalie&#39;s hand desperately. &#34;Natalie, please, take me with you! Daniela knows too much; I&#39;m dispensable to her now. If you leave me here, neither Daniela nor Mr. Perry will let me be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s lips tightened. She methodically removed Elyse&#39;s fingers from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, that&#39;s not going to happen. You&#39;re Daniela&#39;s aunt, and we&#39;re family. Why would she harm you?Besides, Nina is still here. She&#39;s your daughter too, and she won&#39;t let you come to harm. I need to leave;my flight is at three. Just promise me you&#39;ll look after yourself. Once I return from my studies, Daniela has promised me a company. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re well cared for then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie then signaled for a taxi. She walked away without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Elyse stood frozen, as if struck by a sudden revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unbelievable to her. The child she had raised and loved was now casting her aside to fend for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes darted around in panic. Then, suddenly, a piercing scream tore through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflexively,Elyse looked upwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, her heart stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From somewhere above, a flowerpot plunged straight towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s breathing halted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely registered the forceful pull on her arm when, moments later, the sound of the pot smashing into the pavement echoed around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing at the broken pieces on the ground, Elyse&#39;s face registered utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Elyse whispered, her body shaking, her complexion ashen. &#34;I need to get to Daniela.She&#39;s the only one who can shield me now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to the elevator, her heels nearly slipping until she finally managed to hit the call button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse burst into Daniela&#39;s office, tears cascaded down Elyse&#39;s cheeks. &#34;Daniela, it&#39;s all my fault! I shouldn&#39;t have colluded with outsiders against your mother. Mr. Perry wants revenge. He knows I turned on him! You must help me. I don&#39;t want to die, Daniela, please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded her with a detached calm. She had not anticipated Elyse&#39;s spinelessness. Such a minor scheme had unraveled her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you expect me to save you?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was cold as she remained seated. &#34;To save the one responsible for my mother&#39;s death? What are you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can disclose everything I know, just as Natalie did. I know more than her! She was too young to remember everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation filled Elyse&#39;s eyes as she pleaded, &#34;Daniela, please give me a chance. We&#39;re family, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Since we&#39;re family, I&#39;ll let you decide-a painless death or a miserable life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s pause, Elyse exclaimed,&#34;I choose to live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little did Elyse know, there existed a fate much harsher than death itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From then on, every day of her life was tainted with remorse over her decision.</p>
