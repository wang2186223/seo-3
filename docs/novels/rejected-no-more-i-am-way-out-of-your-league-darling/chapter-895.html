                <p>Joseph gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered in Hamilton&#39;s eyes. &#34;Can you believe it? I set Nikolas up with some of the most eligible women in the country, and he turned every one of them away. Now he&#39;s chasing after Daniela&#39;s assistant?What a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Joseph and shouted, &#34;By this time tomorrow, I expect you to dig up everything there is to know about this Carol. Don&#39;t miss a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied that he had given clear orders, Hamilton decided he should see Daniela in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncharacteristically, he chose a courteous approach this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By sunrise, Hamilton was already outside her office, dismissing the secretary&#39;s attempts to hold him back as he strode right into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made sure Cedric was out before coming here. There are a few things we should talk about privately-and the sooner, the better,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, having predicted Hamilton would eventually come, hadn&#39;t expected him to arrive so abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his urgency told her that Loglil must have dangled an irresistible offer, pushing Hamilton to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm smile formed as Daniela picked up her phone. &#34;Since you made a point to visit while my husband&#39;s away, I take it this isn&#39;t a conversation you want him overhearing. Let&#39;s continue downstairs in the cafe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Hamilton&#39;s features. Daniela usually stood her ground, but today, she appeared unusually accommodating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Hamilton followed Daniela out of the office and down to the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the cafe, Hamilton wasted no time cutting to the heart of it. &#34;I&#39;Il be blunt. Think of this as a peace offering. I want you to end your marriage to Cedric. If this sum doesn&#39;t meet your expectations, you&#39;re free to suggest a number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A check slid across the table to Daniela, its amount written in bold-a million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An amused smile tugged at her lips. &#34;I have to say, I didn&#39;t realize Cedric meant that much to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s laugh came out cold and dismissive. &#34;You know as well as I do that Cedric is sharp when it comes to business. My family has plenty of money. If he leaves you and gets nothing, you&#39;ll walk away with the windfall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted to the check, considering his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The facts, uncomfortable as they were, rang true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should a straightforward divorce ever occur, Daniela and Cedric would split their assets right down the middle-leaving Cedric with tens of billions. Hamilton&#39;s plan, though, aimed to strip Cedric of everything,forcing him to walk away empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deal like that would make Daniela the clear winner, at least by anyone else&#39;s standards. Accepting the offer would be the logical move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth, though, was that nothing about her marriage to Cedric fit into neat categories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light chuckle slipped from Daniela as she flicked the check across the table, her eyes sharp with amusement. &#34;No denying Cedric&#39;s got a talent for building fortunes. Why would I let him go when he&#39;s still making me richer by the day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer wiped the patience off Hamilton&#39;s face. &#34;So you&#39;re finally admitting you married Cedric for the money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that on purpose because he spotted Cedric&#39;s silent arrival out of the corner of his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the theatrics, Daniela kept her cooI. She had no interest in Hamilton&#39;s petty games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was crisp and cold. &#34;You might want to refine your strategy. Underhanded moves like that don&#39;t impress me.&#34; Embarrassment reddened Hamilton&#39;s cheeks, his anger mounting by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile lingered on Daniela&#39;s lips. She wasn&#39;t here for a shouting match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Cedric with a calm nod and said, &#34;You can go back upstairs. I&#39;ll take care of things here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s original hope had been to keep Cedric in the dark, but now that the truth was out, he switched tactics, wanting Cedric to stay and listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Hamilton&#39;s disbelief, Cedric didn&#39;t even pause-he simply nodded and made his way out, trusting Daniela without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer obedience left Hamilton rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric just listened and left-no questions asked, no arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A visible tremor ran through Hamilton&#39;s expression, his frustration barely kept in check as he stared after Cedric&#39;s retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, amused laugh slipped from Daniela. &#34;Keep your check. Money isn&#39;t something you can outmatch me with. But there&#39;s something else you need to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatience radiated from Hamilton, but his annoyance faded as soon as Daniela pulled out her phone and tapped play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail of McCoy Group&#39;s confidential meeting rang out, each word echoing with undeniable clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of disbelief rooted Hamilton to the spot, leaving him motionless. &#34;How did you get your hands on this?Is there a traitor in McCoy Group? Who&#39;s feeding you our secrets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of indifference, Daniela slipped her phone back into her bag. &#34;What&#39;s with the shock? Surely you&#39;ve planted a few of your own inside my company too, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness clouded Hamilton&#39;s expression. &#34;Tell me, who&#39;s leaking information? Someone on the board? Or the secretary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile curved Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;This isn&#39;t the moment to worry about how I got it. We should be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>discussing what&#39;s on that recording.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stubborn defiance flared in Hamilton&#39;s eyes. &#34;&#39;There&#39;s nothing to discuss. That&#39;s all ancient history.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a flicker of uncertainty crossed Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Really? Are you sure this is the approach you want to take with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton bit back his retort, his lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;What exactly do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm and unwavering, Daniela&#39;s answer landed like a final verdict. &#34;Blood for blood.&#34;</p>
