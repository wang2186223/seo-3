                <p>As the words hung in the air, Elyse knocked and stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused upon seeing the gathered people, her gaze sharp. &#34;Alexander? You have the audacity to be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ignored Elyse completely, his focus solely on Daniela. &#34;What&#39;s so different? Daniela, you pursued me for ten years. What haven&#39;t you given me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was a soft chuckle, her smile filled with the same self-assured confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes, watching her intently. Standing in front of her, he caught a brief movement of her lips. A single word left her mouth, and a cold shiver ran down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, Killian, and Elyse were standing by Daniela&#39;s side, so they didn&#39;t see the word Daniela mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a word so powerful it left Alexander speechless, defenseless, unable to form a single counterargument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes filled with a deep frustration as he glared at Daniela, feeling completely wronged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, is this how you treat me? Do you know why I&#39;m here? I&#39;m here to tell you l don&#39;t want Bennett Group, I don&#39;t care about my pride, I want nothing but you. If you still want me, I&#39;ll be the man behind you,like your father was for your mother.I will love you unconditionally. Is this how you repay me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spread her hands casually. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, her attention seemed to shift away from Alexander. She glanced past him to Elyse standing in the doorway. &#34;Aunt, is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded, walking forward, briefly glancing at Alexander as she passed by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Alexander seemed stripped of all his previous arrogance, like a stray dog. He appeared to have finally come to terms with his situation. He was trembling uncontrollably, and his eyes lost all focus. Elyse said, &#34;I&#39;ve secured some major contracts for Harper Group that need your signature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly. &#34;I&#39;ve always trusted your work, Aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse smiled in return. &#34;Nina&#39;s graduated now. She&#39;s always been frail. I was thinking of having her work at Harper Group.What do you think,Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela signed the contracts, her smile soft and approving.&#34;Sure, arrange a position for her as you think best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse laughed lightly. &#34;She&#39;s not capable of much, so a regular clerical position will be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela handed over the signed contracts, her smile was warmer than Elyse&#39;s. &#34;I recall Nina studied finance.Let her learn in the finance department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled. &#34;No, she&#39;s a bit too careless. Let her stay by my side as a clerk. If she can&#39;t handle it, I&#39;ll personally take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;It&#39;s your decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse smiled once more. &#34;Nina&#39;s waiting outside. She was determined to see you as soon as she heard | was here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Elyse walked to the door, calling for Nina to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina Dury, Elyse&#39;s eldest daughter, entered the room with a fragile, delicate air about her, her head lowered in a shy gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet as she passed Cedric, she faltered, before standing opposite Daniela and calling her name quietly.&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a soft smile in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice was gentle as she spoke.&#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t want to stay by my mother&#39;s side forever. May I apply to join Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could say a word, Elyse&#39;s expression hardened, her brow furrowing. &#34;Nina, have you lost all sense of your limits? Elite Lux isn&#39;t the place for you. Your health is fragile, so stay with me and prepare for marriage. Why can&#39;t you just listen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Nina couldn&#39;t hold back, and her tears began to fall.&#34;Mom,I&#39;ve graduated. I want to prove myself. I don&#39;t want to follow you forever. I&#39;ve grown up and can stand on my own. Though my health isn&#39;t perfect, Daniela can look after me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood, hands firmly planted on her hips, too furious to say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell over the office as all eyes turned to Daniela, waiting for her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela maintained her calm smile. &#34;It&#39;s good to see Nina has such ambition. Joining Elite Lux is perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s face lit up with excitement at Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lillian opened the door, and from where she stood, she caught Nina stealing a glance at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for Lillian&#39;s sharp instincts, she might have missed it entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina kept her head lowered, her face hidden behind stray strands of hair, her expression a mystery to those around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled. &#34;I told you, Daniela, she&#39;s a bit of a troublemaker. Go ahead and spoil her. Nina, tell Daniela what position you&#39;d like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression soured. It was clear to her that this was all a performance, a scheme to land Nina a spot at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a glance at Daniela, who was unbothered, before taking a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly at Nina, asking,&#34;So,what do you think, Nina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice remained soft, yet every word was unmistakable.&#34;|want to learn from you, Daniela. You&#39;ve always been the one I look up to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t be silly. I&#39;m happy Daniela is your role model, but your future should focus on finding a husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina pouted, clearly displeased with her mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Alright, Nina can start in the secretarial department tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s laughter echoed once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more exchanged pleasantries, Elyse left with Nina. As they passed Cedríc, Nina&#39;s ears flushed red, and she let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chuckle was so soft that only those nearby, like Killian and Cedric, could hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian raised an eyebrow, exchanging a glance with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had left, Lillian stood, her dissatisfaction clear. &#34;Those two are masters of manipulation! What a performance they put on this morning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained rooted to the spot, entirely disregarded by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seething with anger, yet a sliver of hope still lingered as he asked, &#34;Daniela, do you really not want me anymore?&#34;</p>
