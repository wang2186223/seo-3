                <p>Caiden rested against the headboard, a wave of regret washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t understand how Daniela had become so strong-willed and unbending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More and more, her personality reminded him of her late mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he laid eyes on Daniela, it felt like he was face-to-face with her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet, gentle girl who once followed Alexander around was nowhere to be found now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was aware that Katrina wouldn&#39;t let it go unless Daniela gave him the three floors of the Luxor Tower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lit a cigarette, stepped out onto the balcony,and dialed Alexander&#39;s number.  &#34;Hey, Alexander. Are you free tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, still at work, responded, &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a charity gala tomorrow night. Do you have time to attend? I&#39;d like you to take Joyce along to help her expand her horizons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause on the other end of the line before Alexander answered, &#34;Sure.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander was about to hang up, Caiden added, &#34;You and Daniela were married. I noticed her name on the guest list for tomorrow night. Joyce is being stubborn about those floors in Luxor Tower.You remember how Daniela used to listen to you,right? Maybe you could talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused, his grip tightening on the phone.&#34;She doesn&#39;t listen to me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden chuckled softly. &#34;She used to listen to you,didn&#39;t she? I know things were a bit rocky between you two, but let&#39;s be real-you&#39;re planning on marrying Joyce, right? That makes me your future father-in-law. We&#39;re practically family now, so how about doing me this small favor? It won&#39;t take much,just a few words, really. I&#39;m counting on you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexander could get a word in, Caiden hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, sitting in Alexander&#39;s office, sneered. &#34;That old fox is too clever for his own good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander recalled Daniela&#39;s cold, indifferent expression from the night before. &#34;She won&#39;t agree,&#34;he muttered to Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard waved it off. &#34;Let Caiden handle it. Don&#39;t offend Daniela because of Katrina. By the way, have you heard? Daniela just got her hands on that biggest piece of land in the North District-the one nobody else dared to go after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked up, his eyes wide with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gave a thumbs-up. &#34;I&#39;ll give her credit. That land is a goldmine, but the seller wats full payment upfront. Everyone was eyeing it, but no one had the nerve or resources to take it on. And Daniela just swooped in and grabbed it like it was nothing.Alexander, our family&#39;s in the renovation and construction business. You&#39;re going to the gala tomorrow, right? Make sure you land the renovation contract for that property. First, it&#39;ll help rebuild a connection with Daniela. Second, it&#39;s a huge project that could bring in a fortune for us. And third, it&#39;ll relieve some of the pressure on our company next year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was reluctant. The idea of trying to win Daniela over for money didn&#39;t sit right with him.He had tried to talk to her a few times lately,but each time, she ignored him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was proud, and begging was never on his list of things to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just last night, he had tried to offer her some advice,only for her to snap at him and shut him out entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was the Daniela who once cared for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she was playing hard to get, this was crossing  the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with his father pushing him, he figured he&#39;d give her one last chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold look, Alexander responded to Richard,&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Alexander stepped out in a sharp new suit that looked like it was made just for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce arrived, her eyes widened, and she couldn&#39;t hold back a gasp. &#34;Wow! Alexander, you look absolutely stunning today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tailored suit made a real impact. Her eyes were drawn to his broad chest, and admiration lit up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she couldn&#39;t help but think that Alexander was everything she could ever want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Cedric? She decided he could stay with Daniela, that cold, toxic woman. Joyce rode with Alexander to the gala. On the way there, she leaned in and spoke softly. &#34;Alexander,thank you for bringing me tonight. I know it&#39;s tough for you. Daniela is such a difficuIt person. To thank you for your kindness, I&#39;m willing to marry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words trailed off suddenly as the car came to a stop at the entrance of the gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on a man standing near the door,and her breath caught in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a real catch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up, practically glowing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked nothing like the man she remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, he was a vision of sophistication in a custom-tailored dark blue suit, with a refined sapphire brooch pinned to his chest and matching gemstone cufflinks gleaming at his wrists. The entire outfit seemed made just for him, enhancing his already tall, striking figure and radiating an air of elegance and class that made him look even more impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum was always handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Incredibly handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike most men, he had a royal quality about him-a natural, commanding presence that made him stand out effortlessly. Every mnove he made seemed to capture attention, as if he were the center of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever Joyce had planned to say to Alexander was quickly forgotten. Without saying another word, she swung open the car door, grabbed her dress,and nearly ran towards Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, observing everything unfold, couldn&#39;t help but glance at Alexander and mnutter, &#34;Sir,honestly, Joyce isn&#39;t worth you giving up Daniela for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least Daniela wouldn&#39;t fall for another the moment a better option came along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t fawn over other men. It was painfully clear what had just happened. Only moments earlier, Joyce had been hinting that she wanted to marry Alexander. But the second she saw Cedric, she completely forgot the idea and rushed towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shallow, opportunistic nature mirrored Katrina&#39;s all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like mother, like daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice was steady, almost indifferent.&#34;I never liked Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, surprised by his response, turned to him in disbelief and asked, &#34;Then why did you divorce Daniela for her?&#34;</p>
