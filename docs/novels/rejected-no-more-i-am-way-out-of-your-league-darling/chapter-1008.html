                <p>Hamilton was caught off guard. His two sons, Nikolas.and Cedric, were utterly rebellious, unwilling to walk the pathhe&#39;d paved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could understand why Cedric chose Daniela-she was a force to be reckoned with, a titan on the world stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Carol? She was a nobody. Just Daniela&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to say?&#34; Hamilton yelled at Nikolas. &#34;Since you&#39;re all gathered here, I&#39;ll just say it.Carol-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hamilton managed to finish,Daniela tilted her chin, her voice slicing through the tension. &#34;You need to realize exactly where you&#39;re standing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked, caught off guard by her icy rebuke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed him with a look sharp enough to cut glass. &#34;This is my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from the sofa. Sunlight slipped behind a bank of clouds, casting a gray shadow across her face and making her appear even more untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her eyes drift over Nikolas, then pinned Hamilton with a final, cold stare. &#34;Here, you think you ela&#39;s Fruit can lecture my people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw clenched, frustration roiling in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze grew colder.&#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flushed with anger and humiliation, Hamilton shot Nikolas a glare, then Daniela, before spinning on his heel and marching out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked at Nikolas from the doorway, his patience snapped. &#34;What are you waiting for? Get moving!Remember this-either you stay single forever, or you marry Miss Rowe. Those are your only options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Hamilton stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas remained rooted to the spot, his eyes locked helplessly on Carol. Words seemed to fail him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rolled her eyes and instructed the housekeeper to see them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper walked over, voice gentle but firm.&#34;Mr.McCoy, let&#39;s not make this any harder. It&#39;s time to go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched, Nikolas forced himself to speak. &#34;I&#39;m going now, Carol. And I mean this-I&#39;ll never marry anyone else. I&#39;d rather be alone than spend my life with someone who isn&#39;t you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered her one last lingering look before striding away, the set of his shoulders rigid with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brad lounged in the living room, idly it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>popping fruit into his mouth, a quiet grin curving his lips as he took in the wvhole chaotic scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was the third day. Tomorrow would be the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela turned her head, she caught Brad&#39;s sly grin-smug,unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t dignify him with a reaction,simply tossed him a bored glance before sinking onto the sofa and flipping through channels, her posture radiating indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, once the living room had emptied and Brad had disappeared down the hall, Ethan crept over to her side, dropping his voice to a whisper. &#34;Daniela,I&#39;m telling you-there&#39;s something off about Brad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance still simmered under Daniela&#39;s calm exterior, but she refused to lash out at anyone else.She gave Ethan a sidelong look, eyebrows raised in silent invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed on, earnest and worried. &#34;I&#39;m not messing around. You have to trust me. We grew up together -I know what he&#39;s like. He didn&#39;t write any confession,and now he&#39;s lurking. That&#39;s not normal. He&#39;s obsessed with money, and after losing so much, he won&#39;t let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let herself sink further into the cushions, her gaze steady but unreadable. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan studied her, clearly wishing she&#39;d show a little more alarm, but all he could do was sigh in frustration. Despite everything, Daniela was still just a girl-one who rarely took advice until the fallout landed squarely on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan released another quiet sigh, catching a glimpse of Brad creeping into the kitchen,his movements sly and guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the housekeeper was out fetching a package, and Cedric was in the yard, plucking lemons from the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stepped closer, his tone sharp as he called out to Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad jerked so hard the fruit nearly slipped from his grip. He spun around, face pinched with panic, and hissed under his breath, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with you? Have you lost your mind? Why are you yelling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad darted a nervous glance toward the living room,checking if Daniela had noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela was still absorbed in her show,he set the fruit back, grabbed a mug of steaming coffee to cover his tracks, and slipped out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, unconvinced, lingered in front of the refrigerator for several moments before finally asking,&#34;What were you up to just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad dragged Ethan into his bedroom and shut the door. &#34;Mind your own business. Just know that everything I&#39;m doing is for the McCoy family.&#34; Ethan&#39;s eyes narrowed in suspicion. &#34;Did you do something to Daniela&#39;s fruit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad took a leisurely sip of coffee, refusing to answer,but the smug curve of his lips said enough-he looked like a man who&#39;d just pulled off a masterstroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really messed with her fruit, didn&#39;t you?&#34; Ethan&#39;s tone grew sharp, his frustration mounting. &#34;Daniela&#39;s pregnant! What did you do? Those babies-do you even realize they&#39;re McCoy blood? When Dad died, he made it crystal clear: no one is ever to harm the family. What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flashed in Ethan&#39;s eyes. &#34;And Daniela&#39;s carrying twins. Are you actually after them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a theatrical sigh, rolling his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s got you so riled up? They&#39;re not even your children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That offhand remark sent a chill crawling down Ethan&#39;s spine. He studied Brad&#39;s cold, unconcerned face. &#34;Maybe they&#39;re not mine, but they&#39;re still part of this family. I won&#39;t let you hurt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened as adrenaline surged through him.&#34;Forget it. I&#39;m telling Daniela right now. She can&#39;t touch that fruit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode toward the door, urgency driving every step.</p>
