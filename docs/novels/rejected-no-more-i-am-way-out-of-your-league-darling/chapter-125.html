                <p>The call from Alexander caught Joyce off guard, yet her voice brimmed with an unexpected happiness when she picked up. &#34;Alexander, is this a surprise call to say you&#39;ve reconsidered? Ready to mnarry me at last? You know, my mom mentioned that marrying me comes with the Harper family&#39;s fortune. Of all the suitors, you&#39;ve always been my top pick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander barely had a chance to reply before the phone was abruptly passed to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice, firm and calculating, filled the line.&#34;Alexander, did you finally come to your senses?I always knew you were the clever one. Here&#39;s the deal -I hold the reins to the Harper family. Marry Joyce,and all that wealth could be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice was steady,his gaze fixed on Daniela as he spoke. &#34;I called to make it clear-I will not marry Joyce. Not now, not at my father&#39;s behest.I&#39;ve realized that my heart still belongs to Daniela, and I&#39;ve chosen to be with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving Katrina a chance to react, he ended the call with a swift tap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the insistent buzz of Katrina&#39;s callbacks,Alexander turned to Daniela, his expression earnest.&#34;I&#39;ve made my stance clear to them, Daniela. Is it finally our time to be together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a grin as she remarked,&#34;Alexander, you really went all out, didn&#39;t you? Ionly said I&#39;d think about it, not that it was a done deal.Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re getting ahead of yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was aware that Daniela had only agreed to consider his proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His impatience was getting the better of him. He believed that settling things quickly would be more efficient, particularly with Cedric hovering nearby, a constant threat to his peace of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve known each other for years. Is there really anything left to ponder?&#34; he implored, his eyes scanning her expressive face, his heart fluttering with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a derisive chuckle. &#34;You&#39;ve known Joyce for ages too, yet you didn&#39;t hesitate to cut her off just moments ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just...&#34; he stuttered, searching for the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile grew sharp. &#34;No need to spell it out.I get it. You&#39;re the type who looks at the grand scheme of things. There&#39;s no need for excuses with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Alexander felt a weight lift off his shoulders. This was promising. Daniela was beginning to see things from his angle. It wouldn&#39;t be long before she returned to being the woman who had always supported him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I miss the way you used to be-generous,gentle, and considerate,&#34;he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter rang out again, light and carefree.She was generous,indeed-turning a blind eye while he shamelessly flirted with her stepsister. Her gentleness was undeniable, always attentive to whatever Alexander had to say. She was undeniably considerate-obedient to a fault and painfully naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he liked such a fool woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you telling me that my power, status, or wealth don&#39;t matter to you?&#34; Daniela queried, her gaze piercing into Alexander&#39;s soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm shake of his head, Alexander responded,&#34;How could those superficial things be the reasons I cherish you? Daniela, believe me, my desire to be with you now is sincere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression softened as she nodded in agreement. &#34;I&#39;m relieved to hear that. I, too, prefer that my wealth doesn&#39;t entangle with my future partner. Genuine relationships shouldn&#39;t sprout from personal gain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a moment before, Alexander was brimming with vigor. Now, his face registered shock, as if struck by lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He questioned his own ears, wondering if they had deceived him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting a smile, he managed only a tense grimace, his eyes locked on Daniela&#39;s. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
