                <p>Once breakfast ended, it was time to head back to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas started toward the car, planning to ride with Cedric and Daniela without thinking twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he reached for the handle, someone stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood still, his tone ice-cold. &#34;You&#39;ll take the car behind us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all he said. No explanation. No room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was caught off guard by the authority in Cedric&#39;s voice. He had expected more courtesy, at least for the sake of their business arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,he had misjudged Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked from Cedric to Daniela, and something clicked. So Daniela was his Achilles&#39; heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Nikolas walked toward the  second car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela took her seat beside Cedric in the back of the first one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the vehicle rolled forward and paused at a red light,Cedric spoke. &#34;The question Nikolas asked... you haven&#39;t answered yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t need to ask what he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes stayed on the passing view outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you had no family,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver glanced in the mirror, then quickly pressed the button to raise the partition. The air inside was too heavy to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hope in Cedric&#39;s chest faded. What had started as longing settled into quiet resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car arrived at the entrance to Phillips Group,the driver stepped out in a hurry, as though escaping something suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Cedric spoke up. &#34;If you want, I can be your family. I&#39;d never betray you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped for a second. Her fingers rested on the doorframe. Then, without a word, she got out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stepped from the car behind them, took one look at Cedric, and scoffed. &#34;Pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need any more proof. Cedric was hopelessly tied to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving forward, he would handle things through Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting ended, Nikolas made his way over to Daniela alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They met at a cafe. He sat quietly,eyes on the traffic outside. &#34;I&#39;m willing to work with you,&#34; he said flatly.&#34;But I&#39;ve got a condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a sip of her coffee, unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her, surprised by her calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people would be eager over an offer like his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My condition&#39;s simple,&#34; he added. &#34;Cedric must never leave Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her eyes, her expression unreadable. Nikolas loosened his tie, suddenly aware of how warm the room felt. &#34;Do you get what I&#39;m saying? My family will purchase every product Phillips Group puts out. No matter the volume, we&#39;ll take it all. Isn&#39;t that a rare chance? What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint smile. &#34;You really think that&#39;s a rare chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows pulled together. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her cup down and spoke evenly. &#34;You just said you&#39;d buy everything Phillips Group made.Based on the current numbers, we&#39;re talking fifty billion a year. Over twenty years, that&#39;s about a trillion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded slowly, his smile still holding. &#34;So,you&#39;re saying-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But your family&#39;s net worth makes that look like pocket change,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face tightened. &#34;What are you implying? I don&#39;t follow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You offer crumbs, then expect eternal loyalty in return. Keep him grateful. Keep him small... Tell me,Mr. McCoy, who taught you to treat people like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. &#34;I&#39;m offering a solid deal. What does that have to do with my family&#39;s money?&#34; &#34;Nothing? Are you sure about that?&#34; Daniela leaned forward. &#34;In business, I&#39;ve learned one thing. There&#39;s always a price. You know that too. Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t run the numbers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened. His gaze cooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back in her chair and stared at the Phillips Group building across the street. &#34;Let&#39;s not play games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas opened his mouth, but Daniela cut him off.&#34;You released Caiden from the mental institution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. Then he lowered his eyes. When he looked back up, the friendly mask he wore earlier was gone.Only cold calculation remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know who I am,&#34; he said, meeting her eyes.&#34;You know why I came here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; expression grew colder. &#34;You&#39;re thinking of helping him, aren&#39;t you?&#34; His eyes bore into Daniela&#39;s,unyielding and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted the cup again, took a slow sip, and set it down. &#34;You think I&#39;m not capable of that?&#34; Nikolas leaned forward. His stare darkened wouldn&#39;t dare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed, her voice calm but firm. Her eyes never left his. &#34;Try me.&#34;</p>
