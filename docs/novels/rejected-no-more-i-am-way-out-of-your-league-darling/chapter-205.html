                <p>Cedric was in such a rush that he didn&#39;t even have time to straighten his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danielá cast a glance his way, handed him a towel, and settled down to tackle her puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire evening passed without a word from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood off to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, Daniela engaged with her puzzle until midnight. When weariness overtook her, she rose to sleep,disregarding Cedric as if he were a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood there, torn between staying or leaving as Daniela turned her back on him, leaving him staring at her receding figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was bathed in the soft glow of a dim yellow lamp. Daniela&#39;s even breathing signaled her deep slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Head bowed, Cedric held the towel Daniela had given him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, he raised his hand to dry his hair with the towel, only to realize it was already dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela woke the next morning, Cedric was prepared to clear the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela retreated to the bathroom. When she emerged again, she simply told him,&#34;Go wash up and come have breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone thought Daniela had brushed off the incident, but Cedric sensed a shift in her demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, she offered him smiles, but they never reached her eyes; they were just a facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She allowed him to stay but rarely inquired about his well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he came home late, the warm milk that Josie used to prepare at Daniela&#39;s behest was conspicuously absent. On rainy days, Daniela no longer had someone pack an extra shirt and suit in the car for hím.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when these courtesies vanished did Cedric realize how much he had taken for granted the closeness between him and Daniela before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden seemed blind to the change in Daniela, consumed with the three hundred million dollars, only to be chased off by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As time passed, everyone started to notice Daniela&#39;s growing distance from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just a physical distance but a breach in the silent understanding that once connected them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was secretly pleased with this development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt his time with the Harper family had been fruitful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how charming Cedric appeared, he had reached an impasse with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference was that Daniela had once doggedly pursued Alexander for a decade, which gave him a sense of superiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when Cedric was no longer welcomed in Daniela&#39;s room, Alexander could almost feel Cedric&#39;s dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding a beer, Alexander joined Cedric in the pavilion, seating himself next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you?&#34; Alexander scoffed. &#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t know the meaning of commitment. She&#39;s just in it for the thrill of the chase, then she coldly casts aside her conquests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a sip of his beer, his tone flat. &#34;Really? So, you&#39;re admitting you were caught in her net?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; Alexander sputtered, his face contorting. &#34;I was never like you. I never harbored feelings for Daniela, It was all her doing-a one-sided obsession.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s laugh was scornful. &#34;Is that so? Well then, I hope you and Joyce find everlasting bliss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t even muster a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Cedric&#39;s composed, assured demeanor and attempted to emulate it by stretching out his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, observing his profile, felt a mix of relief and smugness. &#34;Cedric, just give up. You&#39;ll never win Daniela over. She revels in manipulating emotions. You can&#39;t outsmart her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tilted his head back and finished his beer in one gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The empty bottle sailed through the air in a perfect arc as he tossed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, haven&#39;t you gained from all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stiffened, gripping his beer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smirk was cutting. &#34;Just because Daniela doesn&#39;t vocalize it, don&#39;t think we&#39;re all blind. She stays quiet because she doesn&#39;t care enough to comment. But if you keep slandering her, don&#39;t blame mne for coming down hard on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned, his face a mask of shock. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say Daniela played with your feelings? When the financial crisis hit, the Bennett family wasn&#39;t spared.Then,out of nowhere, you landed a massive overseas order paid in full upfront, which saved Bennett Group from collapse and led it to flourish, becoming the wealthiest in Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Alexander felt a cold shiver as he regarded Daniela anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After becoming the richest in Olisvine, Richard grew too confident and faced a liquidity crisisthe following year.Who persuaded the bank to extend a substantial loan to the Bennett family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett Group stabilized, but during the year you married Daniela, Richard&#39;s careless remarks nearly caused your downfall. Who crafted the PR strategy that not only salvaged your reputation but turned a crisis intoa J triumph? That move is still celebrated as a masterstroke by PR experts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze on Alexander was unyielding. He concluded, &#34;Everyone sees you, Alexander, as the savvy CEO who steered Bennett Group through troubled waters. But is that the reality? Alexander,Daniela might not bother keeping tabs on these favors with you, but I&#39;m someone who remembers every detail. If you continue to be ungrateful and spread falsehoods, then rest assured, I&#39;ll account for everything, including the grievances you aired during your divorce from her!&#34;</p>
