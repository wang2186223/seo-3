                <p>Alexander held a certain weight in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People usually knew better than to speak to him without respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being yelled at like some common fool left him frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t stop there; he even shoved Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stumbled backward, arms flailing to catch his balance. Hamilton realized he had to get out of the car now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a quiet breath, he shoved the door open.and stood up straight.&#34;What the hell is going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon turned his head to see Hamilton&#39;s icy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His boldness vanished in an instant. &#34;Father, why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t even blink in his direction. Hlis eyes were locked on Daniela.&#34;Quite the move you pulled-stealing both of my sons like it&#39;s some kind of game. Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze with a calm smile. &#34;You give me too much credit. Your sons came to me on their own,actually. I&#39;ve been starting to wonder if the real issue lies within your family. Otherwise, why would your sons keep running away from home? By the way, how many sons do you have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s eyes lit up the moment he heard it. He leaned forward and said, &#34;Five. Including me, there are five of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was awkward. Hamilton didn&#39;t say a word. Neither did his secretary. Alexander looked like he wanted to disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head, eyes glinting. &#34;Five sons. That means three are still at home. If raising them has become too much for you, let me help. After all, you&#39;re not getting any younger. I wouldn&#39;t mind taking them in. No charge.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s face darkened like a storm cloud. &#34;How generous of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed softly.&#34;Oh,no need to thank me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they traded barbs, the host inside was starting to panic. Two of Oiscoll&#39;s biggest names were standing outside his building, practically fighting. He had to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurrying to the entrance, he smiled nervously and welcomed them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela excused herself to the restroom, Hamilton instructed his secretary to call Damon over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon came over reluctantly, clearly annoyed. &#34;What now? I&#39;ve got stuff to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s grip tightened around the cup on the table. For a second, it looked like he might throw it straight at Damon&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he really could&#39;ve strangled this ungrateful brat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clenched his jaw before speaking. &#34;Tell me something-are you a McCoy or a Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave a slight frown. &#34;McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then act like it. I didn&#39;t send you over there to play errand boy for Daniela. You were supposed to keep an eye on her, not punch one of our own. Alexander&#39;s on our side. Have you completely lost it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the words were harsh, Damon kept his mouth shut. He knew Hamilton wouldn&#39;t truly tear into him-not in front of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough,Hamilton leaned in slightly. &#34;I&#39;m not asking you to run the family business. Just do one thing for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon looked at him warily. &#34;What thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to know where Daniela&#39;s vulnerable. Find her weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Damon pause.&#34;Her weakness?&#34; His eyes drifted to the side for a moment. &#34;I don&#39;t think she has one. She&#39;s good at everything.&#34; Silence followed. Hamilton said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary/stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexander didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Hamilton said, &#34;Everyone has a soft spot. You need to dig until you find it. Do that,and I&#39;ll never interfere with anything else you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this sat right with Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning by exploiting someone&#39;s flaws didn&#39;t seem like a real victory. And the target was a woman.Moreover, the woman was his idol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of that, he felt Hamilton&#39;s approach was nothing short of disgraceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon made his way back with a quiet grumble, barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, Alexander gave him a sideways glance, then quickly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, the secretary leaned closer to Hamilton. &#34;Sir, it seems Damon has no intention of following through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t hide his irritation. &#34;Let him know l&#39;ll give him a week. That&#39;s it. If he comes up empty-handed, I&#39;ll sell off his casino. In two weeks, he&#39;s off the McCoy Group board. In three weeks, I will freeze all access to his accounts. If we&#39;re still in the dark after a month, he can go stay with Nikolas and play family over at Daniela&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary paused, unsure. &#34;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a little extreme, sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold flicker crossed Hamilton&#39;s face, warning enough to drop the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the secretary crossed the room and leaned toward Damon, whispering the message into his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Damon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threats didn&#39;t bother him as much as one particular consequence-losing the casino. He&#39;d poured everything into building it up from scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s eyes darted back to Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton had already turned his attention to the stage, acting as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s expression hardened, a shadow hanging over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned with Cedric, both of them caught the shift in his mood. Neither of them said a word,though.</p>
