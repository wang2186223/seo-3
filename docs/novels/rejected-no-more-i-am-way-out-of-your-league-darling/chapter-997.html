                <p>Josh&#39;s lips curled into a cold, razor-thin smile before he flicked his attention over to Brad and Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad edged backward, his face draining of color.&#34;Josh, why are you staring at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s tone dropped, low and dangerous. &#34;You&#39;re still living in Daniela&#39;s house, aren&#39;t you? Remember how our father handled the kid Daniela was carrying last time? You could just repeat his method.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad froze, shock rendering him speechless. &#34;You want me to copy what Dad did-set off an explosion and kill Daniela? But this time there are two babies. If we get rid of them, and Hamilton ever finds out, he&#39;ll lose his mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave an exaggerated eye rol. &#34;Why are you suddenly so afraid of Hamilton? When Dad made everything explode, Hamilton didn&#39;t even have the guts to fight back. Or did you forget? If you&#39;ve got a better plan to claw back what Daniela stole fromn us, I&#39;m all ears. But if not, this is the only way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy, uncomfortable silence pressed in on the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shifted his gaze to Ethan, his tone sharpening. &#34;Well? Got anything to say,Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, who&#39;d been burned by Josh&#39;s schemes more than once, decided he was finished playing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, between Josh&#39;s reckless desperation and Daniela&#39;s steady hand, he knew exactly which side was safer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the McCoy family&#39;s fortune went up in smoke, so be it. At least with Daniela, he&#39;d walk away with something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Daniela divided the shares fairly, Ethan had no intention of making trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never been a favorite in the family, much like Hamilton, and his expectations had always been modest.All he wanted now was to avoid further conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the hospital, Ethan confided in Brad, his voice low and resolute. &#34;We&#39;re after the money, not anyone&#39;s head. Josh is only out for himself-he&#39;ll use anyone if it means getting what he wants. I&#39;m done trusting him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared at the pavement, wrestling with his thoughts before finally muttering, &#34;So what now? Are we just going to watch Daniela walk off with everything that should&#39;ve belonged to the McCoy family? You&#39;re really fine with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else can we do if we don&#39;t agree?&#34; Ethan&#39;s tone was level, almost resigned. &#34;If Daniela has what it takes, let her take it all. Sooner or later, someone else would have come for the top spot anyway. No one stays the richest forever. And if we&#39;re nitpicking, it&#39;s Josh who&#39;s screwed me over the most. I don&#39;t trust a word out of his mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chewed his lip, the weight of the moment settling over him. &#34;It&#39;s just... it&#39;s a hell of a lot of money. I wish the McCoy name still meant something. And you know Daniela-she&#39;s not about to let any of us walk away clean. After what we did to her mother, she&#39;s never going to forgive us. She&#39;s already plotting her payback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan paused, thinking back over everything he khew about Daniela. &#34;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s as ruthless as you imagine.If we own up to what we did, maybe she&#39;ll give us a shot at survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d spent enough time.with her to read her temperament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And honestly,&#34; Ethan went on, &#34;we crossed a line. Hamilton was right-business is one thing, but killing people? We went too far. If Daniela wants us to answer for it, then we probably deserve whatever&#39;s coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep furrow appeared between Brad&#39;s brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan continued, &#34;I&#39;m not about to risk my neck. Josh? He&#39;s nothing but a reckless brat, rotten from Dad&#39;s favoritism. I&#39;m done listening to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Ethan paused beside Brad, lowering his tone.&#34;Don&#39;t let him drag you down, either. Daniela isn&#39;t someone you want to cross-she&#39;ll make you pay for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Ethan strode straight to Daniela, determination stiffening his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked her in the eye, his tone stripped of pretense. &#34;We did wrong back then. I&#39;ll write a confession,take whatever sentence you want-prison, anything. All I ask is you leave my family out of it. And I want back the shares I put in, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze lingered on Ethan, weighing the sincerity in his voice. &#34;Understood,&#34; she replied coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan glanced at Hamilton and quietly asked, &#34;So... do we have a deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton tilted his head and breathed,&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy weight slipped from Ethan&#39;s chest. Harboring grudges only dragged a person further into darkness -he&#39;d had enough of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set to work, penning a careful confession addressed to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments before Daniela could take the confession, Brad swung the door wide and entered, echoing Ethan&#39;s exact sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was on us-our famnily&#39;s mistake. Daniela, I hope you&#39;ll be gracious enough to let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words echoed Ethan&#39;s, yet the tone behind them was layered-less an apology, more a plea, tangled with old pride and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of sharp amusement danced in Daniela&#39;s eyes as she turned her gaze on Brad.&#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad responded with an eager nod, forcing a smile. &#34;From now on, we&#39;ll all get along-just one big, happy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan interjected, &#34;Brad, I&#39;ve already written my confession. Want to join me? Lay out the whole mess-what happened, how it started, and how it ended.Might as well leave a paper trail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Ethan&#39;s words landed, Brad stiffened. For an instant, annoyance flashed across his face as he darted a look toward the far wall, jaw clenched. Then, pasting on a grin, he replied, &#34;You&#39;re right, I should.But I banged up my elbow earlier-it&#39;s killing me. Let me patch myself up first. Once I&#39;m feeling better, I&#39;ll put together a real confession. Daniela, you have my word.&#34;</p>
