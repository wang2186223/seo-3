                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed with disdain as she looked at the five men standing across from her. She let out a cold laugh and said, &#34;How about a bet? Do you dare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, standing tall with the McCoy family backing him, gave a smug snort. &#34;A bet? What kind of bet are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile grew even wider. &#34;Simple. If I win, you have to crawl on all fours and bark like a dog in front of everyone.How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers&#39; faces twisted in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran lost his temper first. &#34;Daniela, what the hell did you just say? Who are you calling a dog?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela did not flinch. &#34;I&#39;m talking about you. Didn&#39;t the DNJA test just prove you and the dog are practically family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; jaw locked tight. His face twitched, and he looked ready to strangle her on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly stepped forward and moved in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice stayed cool and sharp. &#34;Well? Are you in or are you too scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing things escalate, Charles hurried over to her side and whispered urgently, &#34;Daniela, what are you doing? This land belongs to the McCoy family. If you keep pushing like this, it won&#39;t end well. Nikolas owns this racetrack. He&#39;s the best rider in all of Oiscoll. Facing him is a guaranteed loss. And your horse? It hasn&#39;t even been tamed. You&#39;re not just risking defeat-you&#39;re putting your life on the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot Charles a freezing look. &#34;Charles, are you still dreaming? You really think Daniela would side with you? She&#39;s with Cedric now. Get out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it. Don&#39;t turn this into a mess. Father won&#39;t be happy either,&#34;Charles whispered. Then he turned and walked away. Daniela&#39;s expression stayed icy. &#34;So, are we racing or not?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas ground his teeth hard. &#34;Fine! lf l lose, i&#39;ll crawl and bark like a dog in front of everyone. But if youlose, you have to admit to everyone that you&#39;re nothing but a crazy woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare was sharp enough to cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been itching for a chance like this, and todav, he finally had it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swore he would make sure Daniela remembered whose turf she was standing on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a careless smirk and stepped forward, but Cedric grabbed her arm, his face full of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered him a small, steady smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, l know what i&#39;m doing. l can win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she pulled free and walked toward the center</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas waved to the stable staff, signaling for them to bring out the horse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff nodded and tried leading the wild stallion closer. The horse lashed out without warning, kicking so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hard that it broke three ribs on one of the handlers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas crossed his arms, looking very pleased with himself, making it clear that Daniela had no way to back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>down now. &#34;Now, let&#39;s get started,&#34; he said smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grabbed her arm again. &#34;This is too dangerous. Let me take your place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela just gave a soft smile. &#34;Trust me.&#34; She walked straight up to the wild horse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wild horse snorted and stomped at the ground, nerves wound tight as a spring. Daniela had bareltaken hold of the reins when the beast jerked its head violently, tossing the reins into the ar beforeslamming them back down with a crack</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas vaulted onto his horse with practiced ease, flashing Daniela a cold, mocking smile. &#34;Daniela, today!&#39;ll show you what real riding looks like. That is, if you don&#39;t get thrown off and killed first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trotted around the track, smug as a king, already drinking in a victory that had not even happened yet. He waved to the crowd like a hero returning from battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the stands, Hamilton leaned forward slightly. His secretary, spotting Daniela&#39;s struggle with her horse,whispered, &#34;Mr. McCoy, should we get her a differenthorse? That horse is too wild. If she falls, especially with all these reporters watching, it will be a disaster for the whole family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave Daniela&#39;s small frame a slow, dismissive look before he laughed under his breath. &#34;Go tell her.If she can&#39;t handle it, she shouldn&#39;t be showing off. If she dies out there, the world will just laugh at us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded and hurried off toward Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, he came jogging back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, thinking the show was over, looked up, only to hear the secretary say, &#34;She refused. She also said if you were worried,you could have Nikolas forfeit now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, who had already risen from his chair, turned his head slowly. &#34;What did she say? Did you hear her right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded stiffly. &#34;I asked twice. She even joked that maybe I needed my ears checked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton said nothing for a long moment, his face hardening from amused to furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped back into his seat with a sneer. &#34;Fine. Let&#39;s see how long her pride lasts once she&#39;s crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary sighed, shaking his head. &#34;This woman is out of her mind. She doesn&#39;t realize Nikolas is the best rider in all of Oiscoll. She&#39;s walking right into a trap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned back in his chair, his expression cold and distant.&#34;Let: her wreck herself if she&#39;s that stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the field, Nikolas caught sight of Hamilton&#39;s scowl and felt a burst of pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Hamilton was displeased with Daniela, he would also be displeased with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Nicolas&#39; eyes, that meant the McCoy family&#39;s fortune would remain his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a signal to the referee. The referee hustled toward Daniea and asked, &#34;Are you ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas guided his horse smoothly to the starting line, while Daniela struggled to keep her wild stallion in check long enough to join him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat tall in his saddle, smug and confident, waiting for the race to begin.</p>
