                <p>Caiden studied Nikolas&#39; hand for a long time. When he finally looked up, his eyes met Daniela&#39;s. &#34;I need a word with you. Alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after saying it, he turned his head to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t speak. His lips pressed into a tight line as he gave Daniela a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew Caiden was about to make a request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she got to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden thought Daniela was going to talk to him, so he braced himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of walking his way, she started climbing the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While moving past Cedric, she said, &#34;Take Nikolas to the guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face fell. &#34;Wait, what about me? I haven&#39;t even said my piece.&#34; He rose from his seat and raised his voice. &#34;Daniela! I told you l wanted to talk. Didn&#39;t you hear me?&#34; She was already halfway up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic started to rise in Caiden&#39;s chest. &#34;Don&#39;t you want to know if Nikolas is the same person from before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t stop to answer. She looked over her shoulder and said to Cedric, &#34;You explain it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left Caiden frozen, confused. Cedric stayed quiet until he had walked Nikolas to the guest room. Only then did he speak. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden blinked. &#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Nikolas is the one who saved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s whole body stiffened. &#34;What? How do you know that? Did you already know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We figured it out just recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;What are you talking about?How could you know something like that? I&#39;m the only one who saw the burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s stare turned sharp.&#34;We didn&#39;t need to seeit.The way you reacted told us everything. You were planning to use that truth as leverage with Daniela.That&#39;s how we know Nikolas is the one who released you from the mental institution.&#34; Caiden slapped his knee in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to give in, he raised his voice again. &#34;Daniela.please! I&#39;m not sure yet. Nikolas might not be the one who helped me! I never said it was confirmed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, realizing she was done listening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His legs gave way beneath him. He sank to the floor,his eyes wandering to the old vase resting on the wooden cabinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had just gone upstairs when a knock sounded at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha came in, visibly upset. &#34;He did it again! He took more things from the house. That&#39;s the eighth time this month. He keeps taking small items your mom got from those auctions back when you were a kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were old pieces-easy to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one had come from Brylee. Thoughtful gifts meant only for Daniela. Priceless now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those items were the only things Brylee had left behind for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had taken them without a second thought.Then he sold them off for pocket change. He never did miss a chance to let her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden returned home the next morning, he wore a grin like nothing was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was waiting on the sofa. Her stare was icy.He didn&#39;t seem to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smug grin stuck to his face as he walked right past her and headed to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spoke up, her tone flat. &#34;Just so you know, I went into your room earlier and accidentally broke your golf club.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden spun around. His face hardened with rage.&#34;What? You broke my club? Where is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I threw it out,&#34; Daniela said calmly. &#34;It was already broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You what? You threw it away? That set cost over a million! Why were you in my room? Who said you could go in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her eyebrows, matching his glare.′′|was looking for a small clay figure my mother gave me when I was a child. She said it was valuable and told me to pass it on to my own kid someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes twitched. The change in his expression was sudden. &#34;Is that so? I didn&#39;t see anything like that. I didn&#39;t even know it existed.&#34; He looked shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped lower. &#34;Didn&#39;t know? That&#39;s strange.I saw you holding it a few days ago. You asked how much it cost her at the auction. Remember that? | told you it was a gift. It was bought for millions back then It&#39;s worth even more now. That&#39;s why I ordered a custom case for it. But I can&#39;t find it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s throat bobbed as he swallowed. &#34;Maybe you misplaced it. You should check again.&#34;&#39; He turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing,&#34; she said, rising from the sofa.&#34;Where did you get the money to buy a million-dollar golf club,Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no job. He spent most days lying around, doing nothing useful. Yet he somehow bought that clublike it was no big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ve noticed some changes. New clothes,high-end brands, rare designer pieces. I even saw a belt that sells for over five million. So tell me-where&#39;s all this money coming from lately? Teach me how, so l can get richer too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden didn&#39;t say a word. He stood frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, slowly, he turned and met her gaze. &#34;You&#39;ve known this whole time, haven&#39;t you? Why are you acting like you don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
