                <p>As Elyse made her way to the hotel room, her excitement was unmistakable; she couldn&#39;t mask the thrill on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Removing Daniela from the equation was key to her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She envisioned finding someone to handle Linden in a way that would leave no trace, just as had happened with Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse walked briskly, occasionally turning to address the reporters trailing her with a crafted smile. &#34;I just can&#39;t rein Daniela in. She has this unsettling obsession with men,which really worries me. To my friends in the media, I know you&#39;re all very capable, but please exercise some discretion in your reporting. After all,she&#39;s my niece, and I hold her dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters exchanged knowing glances, silently commending Elyse on her act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor Daniela, they thought, to have such a manipulative aunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse clutched the room key,waiting for the reporters to ready their cameras for the live broadcast. With a practiced smile, shethen swiped the key card and opened the hotel room door. Elyse&#39;s plan was set against the backdrop of scandalous news: Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux,allegedly caught in a compromising situation with her family doctor. The journalists were hungry for an exclusive story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door swung open,the reporters surged forward like a flood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse,momentarily pushed aside by the rush, smiled in anticipation of the commotion she expected inside: Daniela&#39;s cries of panic and the reporters &#39;gasps of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shared a look of victory with Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One minute ticked by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the anticipated screams of scandal never erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eerie silence filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse,perplexed,made her way through the throng of reporters to see for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room, which she expected to be in chaos, was impeccably tidy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden sat on the sofa, engrossed in his phone, his expression one of genuine surprise as he noticed the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you all get in here?&#34; he demanded. The reporters, stunned, turned collectively to Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared back at Linden,her confusion deepening into a frown as she asked, &#34;Where is Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden looked bewildered. &#34;Daniela? You&#39;re in my room.Why would she be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse didn&#39;t bother to dialogue further with Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she searched the room frantically,yanking back curtains, peering under the bed, and bursting into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anxiety mounting, Elyse found no trace of Daniela.She confronted Linden and seized his collar.&#34;Where did Daniela go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden responded with a smirk, &#34;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re implying. I&#39;m her family doctor, not her husband.Why are you asking where she is at this hour? Are you suggesting something inappropriate between me and her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the cameras that were broadcasting live,Linden said earnestly, &#34;Daniela is a woman of integrity and grace, composed and dignified. She has a strong relationship with Cedric. I&#39;m baffled as to why you would storm into my room with a crowd, shouting her name. What exactly are you trying to prove?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of his statements was filled with implied accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyco wac seething with anger &#34;Impossiblel was definitely in this room. I clearly saw...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly spilled the details but was abruptly interrupted when Natalie sharply tugged at her sleeve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden laughed lightly and responded, &#34;Clearly what?I&#39;m confused. Isn&#39;t Daniela your niece? It seems you&#39;re quite eager for her to be involved in a scandal. What exactly are you up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued provocatively, &#34;What exactly are you plotting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had there not been live cameras rolling, Elyse might Kave lashed out at Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing beside her, watched Linden with a cold stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, her voice dropped to a more calming tone &#34;Linden, we were informed that Daniela was seen in your room. Is someone forcing you to say otherwise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced subtly at the cameras, signaling Linden to play along. &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid, Linden. We are a society ruled by laws. Daniela has influence, but she cannot evade justice. Just speak the truth. With all these reporters here, you have support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her statement was sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters, quick to understand the hidden meaning, looked on with skepticism. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; Linden asked, finding Natalie&#39;s sudden change in demeanor amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, Natalie couldn&#39;t stand to be in the same room as him, but now she was almost flirtatious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How absurd!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once thought Natalie was distant and unapproachable, but he now saw she was no different from anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s face twisted with disgust.</p>
