                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes shot open, shock flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d expected Daniela to dig, but not to unearth so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, real fear crept into his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held his gaze, her voice cool and unyielding.&#34;So it was you all along-the mastermind pulling every string.Isn&#39;t that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s lips curled in a slow, scornful sneer.He let the silence linger, then spat, &#34;Think whatever you want. I&#39;ll give you this-it wasn&#39;t me, but someone from the McCoy family. And Cedric? He&#39;s a McCoy.too.You want payback? Go ahead. Take your revenge.But ask yourself-can you really spend your life with the blood kin of your mother&#39;s murderer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton burned with impatience, aching for Daniela to divorce Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always parade around like you&#39;re so strong,Daniela. So why stay glued to Cedric? Isn&#39;t he a daily reminder of what you lost? Every time you look at him, does your mother&#39;s face haunt you? She died horribly,and yet you run straight to Cedric for comfort. Is this loyalty? Is this how you honor your mother? Tell me -can you really live with yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pinned Daniela beneath a withering glare,his whole posture radiating menace. &#34;End it with Cedric.Right now. Walk away from him, and I&#39;ll lay every secret bare-everything about what happened all those years ago. Isn&#39;t this what you&#39;ve been chasing all along? I&#39;m offering you the truth on a silver platter -if you have the guts to take it. Or was all that talk about justice for your mother just an act? If I keep my mouth shut, you&#39;ll never find out who orchestrated your mother&#39;s death. This is it, Daniela. Your one shot So,are you going to sign the divorce agreement or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, a master at cornering his opponents,pressed his advantage without mercy. &#34;Cedric&#39;s just a man. You snap your fingers, you&#39;ll have a hundred lining up to take his place. But your mother? There was only ever one-and now she&#39;s gone, murdered in cold blood. Somewhere out there, she&#39;s waiting for you to set things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved a divorce agreement across the table, his eyes locked on hers. &#34;Let go of Cedric. Do that, and I&#39;ll give you everything you want. Don&#39;t worry. Cedric won&#39;t walk away with a cent. You have my word. If you just sign this agreement, I&#39;ll give you everything-the entire truth. Just sign, Daniela. Don&#39;t overthink it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice burned with agitation, every line of his face sharp with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, unable to hide her own tension, dug her nails into her palms, sweat prickling across her skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked to Daniela, searching for some sign of resolve, but found Daniela&#39;s poise slipping, her mask of indifference beginning to crack</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tactics struck hard-straight through to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Carol called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton fixed Daniela with an unblinking stare as he muttered sharply, &#34;You lost your memories, didn&#39;t you?But even before that, Cedric was never your first choice. Wasn&#39;t it Alexander you truly loved? That says it all-Cedric&#39;s never really been the one for you.When you left for Oiscoll, you left him behind without a backward glance. Sure, you might mean the world to him, but for you? Cedric&#39;s always just been one of many. You don&#39;t need him. Daniela. You&#39;ve always been powerful on your own-totally self-sufficient.What could he possibly offer you? A little comfort at home? That&#39;s it. But if Cedric becomes someone else&#39;s husband-someone with actual status-he could finally have the life he deserves. He could chase real ambition. Daniela,let him go. Sign the agreement and him free. Do it for both of you-it&#39;s the only choice that makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words settled, Daniela stared down at the divorce agreement before her</p>
