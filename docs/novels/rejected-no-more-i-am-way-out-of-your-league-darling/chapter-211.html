                <p>Caiden was a bundle of frustration and helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, studying Caiden&#39;s tense profile, ventured cautiously,′′|sthere truly no way to salvage the situation with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of a thought flickered across Caiden&#39;s eyes as they unintentionally caught Joyce&#39;s figure nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart momentarily skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden suddenly said, &#34;It&#39;s high time you considered marriage, Joyce. We&#39;ve given you enough time to bounce back after your childbirth. You should be back on your feet by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared at Caiden, her expression a mix of shock and confusion.&#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean precisely what I articulated,&#34; Caiden countered. &#34;Haven&#39;t you always harbored hopes of Joyce tying the knot with Alexander? Well, perhaps now&#39;s the moment to make it happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Katrina had harbored such hopes for Joyce to marry Alexander. But not under these circumstances.Not when the Harper family coffers were echoing emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their business teetering on the brink, they had no leverage to engage the Bennett family seriously.Moreover, Joyce&#39;s circumstances, having a child out of wedlock, had already marred her standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s original blueprint had been to endow Joyce with the entirety of Harper Group. Now, with the group floundering, it was more of a liability than a legacy. Wouldn&#39;t this only serve to diminish her stature in the eyes of the Bennett family even further?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was a man known for his opportunism, and Joyce, marrying without a dowry or a robust backing,would undoubtedly endure significant strife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze upon Caiden was cold, as if she was truly seeing the man he had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man who could patiently navigate the shadows under a formidable woman like Brylee for years and eventually climb to the pinnacle was inherently cutthroat. Naturally, in times of stability, his kindness flourished, but when the seas turned rough, his true colors bled through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was still strategizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce broke the silence. &#34;I agree to marry Alexander. I&#39;m tired of scraping by here. Just the other day, I was out with friends and couldn&#39;t afford a thing. They ridiculed me. If I married Alexander, I wouldn&#39;t have to endure this humiliation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted to soothe her. &#34;Joyce, just a little longer. Daniela&#39;s taking the reins of Harper Group; she won&#39;t let it sink. Once we stabilize, you&#39;ll have the wedding you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce&#39;s mind was made up, her decision to join the Bennett family was unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed upstairs, her displeasure clear, leaving Katrina to exhale in frustration before turning back to Caiden. &#34;Let&#39;s give it some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shrugged. &#34;Fine. She&#39;s your daughter. If you prefer to wait, then we wait. But if Daniela doesn&#39;t turn this around, soon there won&#39;t even be a shell of a company left. That will make Joyce&#39;s prospects with the Bennett family even slimmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clenched her fists, whispering sternly,&#34;Just a bit longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela&#39;s robotics company was unveiling its latest innovations at a grand launch event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The facility buzzed with the showcase of fully automated systems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was visibly awestruck by this modern tide of technological prowess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the exhibits was an advanced domestic robot that left the crowd spellbound. Richard was eager to acquire one, but the staff explained it was still undergoing trial phases, reserved only for selected VIPs.Richard wasn&#39;t on that list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Richard&#39;s acquaintances had snagged a trial unit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Richard and Alexander, Trevor Greville beckoned them over. The robot, matching a human in height, was a mnarvel of engineering, equipped to cook, clean, and even tutor children. It could engage in games like chess. Its versatility was simply astounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is revolutionary,&#34; Trevor exclaimned, admiring the machine. &#34;Crafted from steel yet capable of managing myriad tasks. I hear it can even conduct basic health diagnostics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Richard, noticing his somber expression, and inquired, &#34;With your family&#39;s clout in this city,you didn&#39;t receive a trial model?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard compressed his lips, casting a longing glance at the robot.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor nodded. &#34;That&#39;s unfortunate. Had Alexander stayed married to Daniela, your doorstep would probably be swamped with these robots. No trial list needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor sighed. &#34;Wasn&#39;t there talk that Alexander was seeing that Joyce? Are they engaged? Planning to marry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard managed a rueful smile. &#34;They&#39;re not engaged. Just dating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor shook his head. &#34;Richard, we groom our successors to uphold and fortify ourlegacies.Severing ties with Daniela was a grave error. Joyce doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Daniela, not in looks, not in brains, not in grace. Caiden might dote on Joyce, but is she really suitable marriage material? Today&#39;s youth might be liberal, but have you seen anyone rise to prominence with a past like Joyce&#39;s? She got pregnant without even knowing the father. What does that say about her judgment? That&#39;s just lacking discernment. If you welcome someone like that into your family, do you honestly think you&#39;ll find peace?&#34;</p>
