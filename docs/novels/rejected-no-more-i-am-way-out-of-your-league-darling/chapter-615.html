                <p>Elite Lux was drowning in an economic storm,battered by one crisis after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the last three years, the headquarters had been drained of nearly every resource,leaving the company gasping for stability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had spent the entire afternoon buried in work,barely pausing to take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol approached, holding a report in one hand.&#34;Alexander is downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela checked the time-it was already ten at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants you to come for dinner,&#34; Carol added.And from the looks of it, he&#39;s not planning to leave until you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips together, wrapped up the report, and made her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Alexander spotted Daniela in the distance, he smiled widely and drove her to the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,you love cod, don&#39;t you? And the prawns are  supposed to be great tonight. I&#39;ll get those,along with a few of their signature dishes. You just recovered-you need the nutrition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, had little interest in food. She took a slow sip of water before setting the glass down.&#34;I&#39;m not hungry. I prefer cutting to the chase. If you have something to say, say it. I don&#39;t have time to sit here playing along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,a reply like that would have irritated Alexander.But now, he simply smiled, pushing the plates towards her. &#34;I get it, you&#39;re busy. But no matter how much work piles up, you still have to take care of yourself,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was gentle, almost coaxing-like trying to convince a stubborn child to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tone made Daniela&#39;s stomach twist in irritation.&#34;Let&#39;s not waste time. What do you want?&#34; she asked bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Can&#39;t I invite you to dinner just because I want to?&#34; Alexander countered with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela pushed back her chair and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression shifted to panic. &#34;Wait! Okay,there is something.&#34; Ever since she&#39;d been with Cedric, he couldn&#39;t recall the last time they&#39;d been this close. He ached for moments like this-to sit together, share a meal, talk like they once did, like family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to discuss a business proposal with Elite Lux,&#34;Alexander said, flashing an easy smile. &#34;Not sure if you&#39;ve been keeping up with the domestic market,but I&#39;m now the sole president of the commerce association. I control resources from over ten thousand enterprises. I&#39;d like Elite Lux to form a partnership with the association.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned forward slightly. &#34;My proposal is simple-all of Elite Lux&#39;s business ventures will receive the association&#39;s full, unconditional support. We genuinely hope to build a long-term partnership with your company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried an unmistakable sincerity. Yet Daniela&#39;s expression remained unreadable, colder than even before her memory loss. This baffled Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just think about it, alright? If you have any conditions,anything at all, name them. I&#39;ll do my best to meet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back in her chair, her gaze cool and unreadable as she studied Alexander.&#34;&#34;Why are you going out of your way to help me? What&#39;s your reason?&#34; Alexander&#39;s lips curled into an eager smile. &#34;Because I like you! Daniela, I love you! Now that I have the power, of course, I want to give you the best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone remained cold. &#34;So that&#39;s why you came to see me today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander blinked, caught off guard. &#34;Isn&#39;t that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His offer meant Elite Lux would have the backing of powerful enterprises-anyone else would be falling over themselves in gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came to Daniela, she remained utterly unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as if, no matter what he did, she would never look at him the way she once had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies, but I prefer to stand on my own,&#34; Daniela said,her voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tensed, his frustration rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;In business, profit outweighs sentiment. Love is too abstract to interest me.I don&#39;t rely on sweet words to secure resources, so while l appreciate the offer, I&#39;ll have to decline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease crept over Alexander. Something felt seriously off. Why was she speaking to him like he was just another business associate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re misunderstanding me. This isn&#39;t a transaction. I&#39;m offering you these resources willingly Don&#39;t belittle yourself-or me,&#34; Alexander said, a trace of hurt in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Then I apologize if I hurt your feelings.&#34;Daniela&#39;s tone remained utterly indifferent. &#34;I&#39;m always direct. My words may be blunt, but that&#39;s just human nature. You&#39;re being kind to me because you want something-maybe it&#39;s my looks, maybe it&#39;s something else. But I&#39;m not someone who fawns over others, and I have no intention of accepting favors l didn&#39;t ask for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela was already rising from her seat. &#34;This conversation is over. Let&#39;s not bring it up again. If that&#39;s all, then excuse me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sat frozen, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that her memory was gone, she hadn&#39;t softened towards him as he had hoped. Instead,she had grown even more resolute, handling both business and personal matters with unwavering decisiveness. It was as if she was silently declaring, &#34;Don&#39;t waste my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched her retreating figure, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, his lips curved into a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he had fallen for her. That unshakable spirit was irresistible.</p>
