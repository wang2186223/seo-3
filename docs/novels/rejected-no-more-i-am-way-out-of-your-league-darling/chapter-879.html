                <p>The following morning, Hamilton secured a private audience with the princess of Loglil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inclined her head curiously, peering over Hamilton&#39;s shoulder with expectation-only to find herself staring at empty space. Her face tightened with dismay. &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise to bring Cedric here to make amends? Where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a low laugh, amused by the princess&#39;s evident concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He intended to be here, truly. When he handed back the emblem, he had no idea it belonged to royalty.Once he discovered who you were, he was mortified and adamant about offering his regrets in person.Unfortunately, an emergency arose at the firm just as he was on his way. He had no choice but to turn back.He asked me to extend his sincerest regrets, and he hopes to meet you soon to apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess lowered her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reflected on her two encounters with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first had taken place at McCoy Restaurant. She was already tired of the McCoy family, but a fleeting glimpse of Cedric that day captivatedher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something mesmerizing about his quiet confidence, a presence that left an impression she couldn&#39;t shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their second encounter was at the opening ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they stood much closer. She saw his eyes.and in that instant, felt lost in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by impulse,she presented him with her emblem.a symbol of royal favor. But he returned it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rejection wounded her deeply, yet the memory of his gentle grip when he helped her to her feet still made her heart flutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying it now. She had fallen for Cedric. She dreamed of a future with Cedric once his marriage ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would cast aside her firm stance against divorced men.Love was worth the gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She parted her lips, voice soft with concem. &#34;What was the emergency? Was it that serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hesitated for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing the intensity in her eyes, he concealed a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t imagined the princess would be so hopelessly smitten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This newfound leverage pleased him. &#34;It&#39;s Daniela,&#34;he replied. &#34;She&#39;s refusing to dissolve the marriage. She&#39;s pulling every manipulative stunt she can think of. They launched the company together, and despite that,she branded it under her own name. Cedric, ever forgiving.didn&#39;t object. But now that he&#39;s trying to end things.she&#39;s demanding he walk away from it all. That&#39;s why he had to turn back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes welled up, giving his performance a touch of heartfelt sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess was visibly moved. &#34;In that case, forget the company. It&#39;s not worth dragging things out wvith Daniela over business matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton inclined his head. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I told him. But Cedric insists it&#39;s not about wealth-it&#39;s about ensuring everything is finalized properly. He&#39;s afraid unresolved details might affect your future together.He genuinely cares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even he seemed stirred by his own story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears shimmered in the princess&#39;s eyes. &#34;TelI him not to rush. I&#39;ll wait for as long as he needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton exited with a smug smile tugging at his lips.Behind him, his secretary watched with a conflicted look. &#34;Mr. McCoy, nothing you said was true.Cedric and Daniela are deeply in love. There&#39;s no divorce.&#34;</p>
