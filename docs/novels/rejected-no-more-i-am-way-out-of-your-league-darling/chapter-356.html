                <p>Daniela remained utterly clueless, her expression one of confusion, yet she was indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, however, was desperate and frantic. &#34;I know you&#39;ve seen my videos with Joyce, but here l am,still standing before you. Do you have any idea how much courage this took?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked with sorrow as he asked, &#34;Do you even realize what this means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face drained of color, yet he stood tall, refusing to hide his vulnerability, determined to set his pride aside for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked eyes with her, urging, &#34;Do you see how determined I am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander desperately sought some sign of emotion, some hint of the passion she once had when chasing after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she remained unmoved, her calmness unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was lost, unable to comprehend Daniela&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I care?&#34; Daniela asked in a detached tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen for a moment, all his hope, vulnerability, and careful emotions crumbling in an instant. His voice wavered. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unaffected, stood in stark contrast to Alexander&#39;s unraveling. She felt like a distant observer in this exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking he hadn&#39;t heard her properly, Daniela repeated, &#34;Why should I care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was direct and forthright.&#34;To me, you&#39;re just a memory from the past, someone | waited for endlessly. I don&#39;t see the purpose of you coming to me now with all these things to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised his voice, desperation clear. &#34;I want us back together. Can&#39;t you see that? Daniela, I regret divorcing you. I want us to be a couple again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knitted slightly at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed on, &#34;You once told me I didn&#39;t understand love. Maybe I was already in love with you back then. It&#39;s just | hadn&#39;t realized my feelings. Daniela, don&#39;t you see? I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yelled, his voice filled with raw sincerity, as though his love for Daniela was the deepest truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could have stayed with Joyce, but you kept haunting my thoughts, every smile and frown of yours etched in my memory. I couldn&#39;t continue with her. Daniela, I was slow to realize, but I now see that you&#39;ll always have a place in my heart. Don&#39;t you remember how wonderful we were together? I want to go back to that time.Can you love me again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela shook her head. &#34;No. It&#39;s not possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face flushed with anger. &#34;Why not? Is it because of Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered calmly, &#34;It&#39;s because I don&#39;t like you anymore. Or maybe, like you, I was slow to realize l never really did. Honestly, this conversation today feels like a waste of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran down Alexander&#39;s spine ather words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela interrupted, her voice more direct than ever. &#34;I have someone I truly love now, and I understand what real love feels like. I never loved you before, I don&#39;t love you now, and I won&#39;t in the future. So,l′dappreciate it if you didn&#39;t come to Elite Lux anymore. It won&#39;t bother me, but it would inconvenience my secretary, and I don&#39;t want to create unnecessary misunderstandings for the person I love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s final words stirred jealousy in Alexander&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened as he shot a sharp look at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a mocking tone, he asked, &#34;How can you be so sure that what you feel for Cedric is love? You chased me for ten years, and now you say it was all an illusion. What makes you think your feelings for Cedric won&#39;t fade like mine did in the future?&#34; His expression twisted with doubt. &#34;How can you be sure Cedric will be your one and only love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, regaining his confidence, confronted Daniela. &#34;What makes you so sure Cedric won&#39;t end up like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Cedric, his gaze hardening as he warned, &#34;Don&#39;t get too comfortable! Daniela loves with all her heart, and what you&#39;re enjoying now is what I once had. My downfall could easily be your future.What makes you think you&#39;re better than lam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Alexander felt a strange satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The future was unpredictable, and he was determined to plant seeds of doubt in their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sense of triumph grew stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one thing for Alexander tospeak to Daniela, but to make her question her feelings and upset her was completely unacceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his gaze, ready to speak out, but Daniela spoke first.&#34;It&#39;s completely different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hung in the air, leaving everyone stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were now on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face registered shock. &#34;How is it different?&#34; he demanded.</p>
