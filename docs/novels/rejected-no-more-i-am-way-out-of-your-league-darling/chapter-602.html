                <p>Huey remained silent, neither confirming nor denying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley broke the silence. &#34;Daniela&#39;s not someone you can sway with sweet talk. She&#39;s got more money than she knows what to do with, and let&#39;s not forget-we&#39;re the reason her mom&#39;s gone. You really think she&#39;l just turn the other cheek?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, Farley tossed Huey a final warning. &#34;Watch yourself. Don&#39;t let her play you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Huley wasn&#39;t buying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t the type to deceive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the brink of motherhood, and when he saw the tenderness in her eyes as she gazed at his granddaughter, he knew he could trust her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t after revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The justice that had been swept under the rug for two decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasted no time-Hackett was officially out of the commerce association. With that done, he set out to find Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But getting to her wasn&#39;t easy. Elite Lux was locked down, and Daniela had made sure he had no way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited, lurking until she finally stepped out for her usual walk. The moment he saw her, he moved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve been waiting for ages. Why are you shutting me out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips thinned, irritation flickering in her gaze. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve kicked Hackett out of the association,&#34; Alexander said, as if expecting praise. She didn&#39;t react. Huey had already given her the rundown over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not stopping with Hackett. I&#39;ll wipe out the rest of them, bring in new blood, and take charge myself. Everything I&#39;m doing is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Huey hadn&#39;t tipped her off that the others wanted Hackett gone out of fear-suspecting him in Marcus&#39;death-Daniela might have actually bought into Alexander&#39;s act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, everything I&#39;ve done, it&#39;s so I can stand beside you the right way: Can&#39;t you see how much I care?Doesn&#39;t that count for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t feel flattered-she felt sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander saw her face pale and moved to steady her, but Cedric was faster. Without hesitation, he kicked Alexander back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You alright?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice was thick with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook off the moment and turned away. Cedric caught her arm gently, then shot Alexander a deadly glare. &#34;Stay away. That&#39;s your only warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, Elite Lux security closed in, ensuring Alexander didn&#39;t take another step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured towards the building. &#34;Let&#39;s go back,&#34; she told Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pregnancy symptoms weren&#39;t too bad-until Alexander showed up. Then, like clockwork, nausea hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she muttered to Cedric, &#34;I don&#39;t know what cologne he&#39;s wearing, but every time he&#39;s near,my stomach flips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had already figured it out-Alexander was trying to find the right perfume to mimic him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the entrance, Alexander watched. He couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying, but he saw Daniela gagging and Cedric hovering protectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d been mnarried for a while now, but suddenly, Cedric was acting all nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed, drifting to Daniela&#39;s stomach. Still flat. Turning on his heel, he pulled out his phone and fired off a message to the association&#39;s group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to find out if Daniela is pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association had people everywhere-hospitals, clinics, places with access to records most people couldn&#39;t touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding pregnancy records? That was easy work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey took a quick screenshot of Alexander&#39;s message and shot it over to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just to be sure, he followed up with a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was at her desk, fingers tapping steadily on her keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for a reply to come through. &#34;We checked the national database-no blood test records for Daniela. She&#39;s probably not pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she&#39;d gone to some exclusive, off-the-books clinic, but even those were tied into the national database.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really not pregnant, then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that pale, sickly look from earlier nagged at him, planting seeds of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lifted to the towering Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One way or another, he&#39;d get his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed the association&#39;s secretary. &#34;Your sister works as a cleaning lady at Elite Lux, doesn&#39;t she? Have her meet me downstairs in an hour. I&#39;ve got something I need her to slip to Daniela.&#34;.</p>
