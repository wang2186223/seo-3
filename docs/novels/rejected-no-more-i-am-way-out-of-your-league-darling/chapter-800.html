                <p>When Daniela arrived. she was told Cedric had already left</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opted to take a shower and change her clothes first</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through her shower, she sensed someone entering the room outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed it was Carol, but upon stepping out,she realized it was Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at his serious expression and gave a light smile. &#34;You know the photos are all fake,so why get so upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, his face still serious, walked over and pulled Daniela into his embrace. &#34;I&#39;m beyond furious! I wish I could just kill Hamilton!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;No need for that. Just go to sleep,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wouldn&#39;t leave, and Daniela didn&#39;t push him to.She picked up her laptop and once again logged into McCoy Group&#39;s internal network. There was still no sign of the original handwriting she&#39;d been searching for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pursed her lips, her disappointment clear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,she skimmed through her newcompany&#39;s latest reports. The numbers seemed promising. She was about to commend Cedric for his progress but found him already asleep in the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was softly lit by a gentle lamp</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her gaze, noticing the dark circles under Cedric&#39;s eyes clear signs of several sleepless nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t wake him, allowing him to sleep, and gently covered him with a blanket before quietly leaving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol spotted Daniela coming downstairs and asked,&#34;Are you heading out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Lillian will join me. Carol, stay here If Cedric wakes up and asks for me, just tell him l&#39;ve gone back to the office.&#34; She glanced at the clock on the wall. &#34;I&#39;ll be back in an hour&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela left, Carol turned to Ryan and asked, &#34;Do you think Daniela really lost her memories? She&#39;s getting along with Cedric just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chuckled. &#34;They&#39;ve always had a close bond.&#34; Even after losing her memories, she couldn&#39;t help but fall for the same man again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol couldn&#39;t quite understand Ryan&#39;s cryptic words and asked, &#34;What&#39;s Daniela doing out so late? Is it fine for her to just take Lillian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan smiled.&#34;It&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had already been informed that Daniela had left her place and was on her way to his villa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly inquired about how long it would take Alexander to reach Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went to the hospital, an unexpected sense of anxiety gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the phone,Alexander reassured him, &#34;Mr. McCoy,don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s my fault, and I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasted no time in shifting the blame &#34;Of course,it&#39;s your fault! Why would I work with someone as foolish as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s composure never wavered. &#34;Mr. McCoy,trust me. Daniela has loved me for years-she wouldn&#39;t be angry with me no matter what I&#39;ve done.I&#39;ll be at the hospital shortly. I&#39;ll talk to Daniela. It&#39;s been too long since we last had a real conversation Believe me, she&#39;s always been lenient with me. And this is nothing but a harmless joke. She won&#39;t hold it against me If anything goes wrong, just put it all on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton remained doubtful. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded, &#34;Absolutely I wouldn&#39;t deceive you.Just trust me and don&#39;t worry about anything else &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had already looked into Alexander and Daniela&#39;s relationship</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was aware that their divorce had been caused by a third party. He figured even if Daniela held some resentment towards Alexander, there would likely still be traces of lingering affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton decided to trust Alexander&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood in Nikolas&#39; hospital room, staring out the window</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela truly forgave Alexander, the rest of the situation would be easier to resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Nikolas asked, &#34;Dad, what are you looking at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded, &#34;Alexander&#39;s here. He said he&#39;ll take care of the fake photos issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was shocked by the news. &#34;What? Daniela&#39;s back? And she knows?&#34; Hamilton looked out the window. &#34;Yes, she&#39;s on her way Alexander is already downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had spent time with Daniela and knew how she despised Alexander. He closed his eyes &#34;Dad,l suggest you don&#39;t put too much hope in Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shrugged. &#34;Alexander assured me it&#39;s no big deal. Besides, Cedric has already taught you a lesson,hasn&#39;t he? Daniela won&#39;t go too far. And remember,she and Alexander were once married-she&#39;ll give him some leeway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked utterly frustrated, unable to express it fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to say something, a sharp crack split the air, followed by a cry of pain. &#34;Ahhh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw Alexander, clutching his broken arm, kneeling at the hospital entrance, trembling from the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s facial muscles twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, he watched as Daniela stepped out from the shadows, her figure emerging from the thickening twilight.</p>
