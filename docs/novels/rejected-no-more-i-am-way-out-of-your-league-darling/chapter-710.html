                <p>Alexander turned his head and caught sight of Natalie, pinned to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bomb she&#39;d clutched moments ago now spewed a soft stream of white smoke, harmless as rist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lay cradled in Cedric&#39;s arms, the two of them sprawled on the ground like survivors of a crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen, shell-shocked and dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brain fumbled to make sense of what had just unfolded before his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had he just done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the most crucial moment, he had turned his back on Daniela, choosing his safety over hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed he was the kind of man who&#39;d risk it all for Daniela-no questions asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just now, panic had taken the reins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t bring himself to say it, but he&#39;d been absolutely terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Natalie came charging at them, his mind went blank. All he could do was run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His instincts screamed at him to flee-to survive, to dodge the blast he thought was seconds away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had said a word about the bomb being fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had to know. He must&#39;ve realized the bomb was a fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had to be the reason he&#39;d acted so fearlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise,how could he ignore the instinct to flee? Why hadn&#39;t Cedric run away? Alexander couldn&#39;t accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more anger started to boil inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Cedric trying to prove with that stunt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this all some grand act to expose his fear-to make him look weak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by frustration, Alexander stormed back, fury in his steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Cedric a soft nudge, a quiet signal to get up. He picked up on it instantly and rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood too, brushing the dust from her clothes as she rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at her, worry lacing his voice. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s tone was filled with regret. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t know it was fake. I just acted on impulse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth to speak, but Alexander charged over, his voice sharp with blame. &#34;Cedric,you&#39;re a damn hypocrite! You knew that bomb wasn&#39;t real, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Alexander, a crease of confusion on his brow. &#34;I didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew he was telling the truth-Cedric hadn&#39;t known a thing. Only she and Carol knew Natalie&#39;s plan to make the bomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t mentioned it to anyone else-she didn&#39;t think it was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gunpowder had been swapped out for flour, turning the bomb into nothing more than theater. Cedric didn&#39;t need to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander wasn&#39;t buying it. &#34;You had to know! Otherwise, how could you have reacted so fast and jumped in to protect Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was losing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept repeating, over and over, that it couldn&#39;t be true. Absolutely impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one&#39;s instinct to protect themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that made sense was that Cedric knew the bomb was fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got it! You sent Natalie, didn&#39;t you? This whole heroic rescue was your idea, wasn&#39;t it?&#34; Alexander thought he&#39;d cracked it. The pieces seemned to fall into place in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed manically, as if losing his mind. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re such a schemer! Daniela, Natalie&#39;s just a pawn in Cedric&#39;s game!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no patience for this. The only reason she&#39;d even spoken to Alexander was because she was waiting for Natalie to make her move. Now that Natalie was caught, she had no desire to waste another second on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Carol and ordered, &#34;Take her inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol hauled Natalie off, while Daniela readied herself to head inside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander stepped in front of her, blocking her way. &#34;Did you hear me? This is all part of Cedric&#39;s plan.How else could Natalie escape from prison and make a bomb? It&#39;s all a bad joke! You&#39;ve been tricked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was fuming mad, but Daniela stayed cool, unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot Alexander a cold look, then said something that froze him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I planned all of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s angry shouts stopped dead in their tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela, his face pale with shock, as if his whole world had collapsed. &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said it again, each word sharp and deliberate. &#34;I planned everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was baffled. &#34;Why? What&#39;s the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;I needed to lure Natalie out. I only told Carol about the plan. Does that make sense now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood frozen, still trying to process what he&#39;d just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela called out for him to come home that Cedric snapped back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew everything from the start, didn&#39;t you?&#34; Alexander yelled, still in disbelief. &#34;You must have!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened today-it&#39;s all part of the plan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered honestly, &#34;I didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sneered. &#34;Who do you think you&#39;re fooling? If you didn&#39;t know, how could you have protected Daniela without a second thought? Weren&#39;t you afraid of dying? Don&#39;t tell me you weren&#39;t scared of dying.I don&#39;t believe it. Everyone&#39;s afraid of death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was terrified,&#34; Cedric admitted, without a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was stunned. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I was terrified,&#34; Cedric repeated; his voice steady but his hands trembling slightly in the bright sunlight. &#34;I was scared out of my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a bomb, after all.</p>
