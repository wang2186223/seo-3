                <p>Daniela had just arrived at the office wwhen a leave request from Natalie landed on her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, working at Elite Lux today, noticed Daniela placing a call to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s urgent. You might need to come over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela hung up, Cedric glanced at her, a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been under the impression that the investigation on Brylee&#39;s death had ended and the threats against Daniela neutralized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Daniela, puzzled, with a subconscious feeling that she was planning something big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Lillian for clarification, but she merely smiled enigmatically and gestured towards Daniela.&#34;Daniela specifically instructed me not to involve you in these troublesome matters, so please don&#39;t put me in a difficult position, alright? You should ask her yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, of course, didn&#39;t press the issue. He knew Daniela wouldn&#39;t confide in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time he had tried to meddle in her affairs, it had resulted in a major clash, with him ultimately backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there any danger?&#34; Cedric asked, his voice laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you trust Daniela?&#34; Lillian chuckled. &#34;She&#39;s meticulous in everything she does, and with you here,she&#39;s even more vigilant about her safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By lunchtime, he had his secretary move all the files from his office to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say much, only instructing the secretarial department to replace Cedric&#39;s furniture with a ridiculously expensive set. It was such a blatant display of power that anyone entering her office would instinctively glance towards Cedric&#39;s now opulent seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie arrived at the company at noon, looking as pale as a ghost. &#34;Ms. Harper, here is all the information on this project. If there&#39;s nothing else, I&#39;d like to take the afternoon off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes were hollow, betraying a deep-seated unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile. &#34;Can you hold on? The negotiating party will be here this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the afternoon, she was visibly distracted, her mind clearly elsewhere. Duing dinner,the partners even subtly hinted to Daniela that Natalie&#39;s performance as an assistant was slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie overheard their comments and blushed, her inability to focus only worsening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous night, after she and Tobin had just stepped off the Ferris wheel, they had run into Linden, who had greeted them with a bone-chilling smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t said a word, just looked at her with that icy grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin had subsequently died in a freak accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A coincidence? Natalie didn&#39;t think so!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the banquet, Daniela noticed Natalie&#39;s downcast expression. &#34;Natalie, if you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed lately, why not return to Harper Group for the time being?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Natalie&#39;s head snapped up. &#34;I&#39;m fine, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied Natalie&#39;s dazed expression and smiled knowingly. &#34;I heard someone saw you with Tobin last night. He died yesterday, did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Natalie could even begin to panic and offer an explanation, Daniela continued, &#34;I also heard you&#39;ve been quite close to Linden lately.Is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s heart nearly stopped beating. She didn&#39;t understand why Daniela had suddenly brought up these two names,wondering if it was a veiled threat or á simple observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, it wasn&#39;t a good sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She desperately wanted to speak, to offer some kind of defense, but Daniela simply waved her hand dismissively. &#34;I&#39;m going home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words Natalie so desperately wanted to say remained trapped in her throat. She was left floundering,watching Daniela&#39;s figure recede into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lingered behind. &#34;Natalie, I think she suspects something. Why not just make your relationship with Linden public?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nina spoke, her hands were clasped behind her back, her phone discreetly displaying an active call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, her nerves frayed to the breaking point, glared coldly at Nina. &#34;Nina, don&#39;t get too big for your boots! Otherwise, I&#39;ll tell the world you&#39;ve slept with Linden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smirked. &#34;Natalie, Linden is completely devoted to you, but you&#39;ve been playing him for a fool.Don&#39;t you think he&#39;ll feel betrayed? Have you ever considered actually being with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing these words, Natalie let out a harsh, mirthless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Linden? Does he even deserve me? Why should I care if he&#39;s hurt? To me, he&#39;s beneath contempt, a grotesque creature with a face only a mother could love and a stature that barely reaches my shoulder. Just looking at him makes me sick to my stomach. How could he ever compare to me? What a joke!&#34; Natalie&#39;s venom dripped with every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s smile widened slightly. &#34;But Natalie, Linden is so good to you, even willing to risk his neck and kill Daniela for you. Aren&#39;t you even a little bit touched?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie,shot Nina a contemptuous look. &#34;Touched? What&#39;s that worth? Linden is only fit to sleep with you!He&#39;s delusional if he thinks he has a chance with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Natalie, no longer able to stomach Nina&#39;s presence, hailed a taxi and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, still holding the active phone call, inquired calmly, &#34;Did you hear everything?&#34; Back at Daniela&#39;s residence, Nina gave Daniela a resounding thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re absolutely brilliant, Daniela! Now all we have to do is sit back and watch the fireworks. Linden is sure to take care of Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had never felt so gleeful, so exhilarated, in her entire life.</p>
