                <p>Daniela only learned about the incident through the news later that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of worry,unsure if Daniela might still have lingering feelings for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she heard about what happened,she turned to her secretary without hesitation and asked, &#34;Alexander didn&#39;t go into my lounge room,did he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a meticulous streak and was a bit of a neat freak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t tolerate anyone she wasn&#39;t close to intruding on her personal space, not even slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he didn&#39;t. Don&#39;t worry; I made sure it was locked beforehand.&#34; Disgust spread across Daniela&#39;s face. The mere thought of someone changing clothes in her office was utterly unacceptable to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she instructed her secretary to have the entire office thoroughly disinfected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident quickly caused Daniela to trend on social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was likely a moment Alexander desperately wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was baffled, unable to comprehend how so many people had suddenly shown up or how things had escalated so dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shareholders of Bennett Group pulled out their investments, and loyal clients abandoned ship. The company now teetered like a fragile house of cards on the verge of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s anger reached such heights that he ended up being rushed to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city buzzed with mockery, and he felt like the butt of every joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gripped the steering wheel with such force that his knuckles turned stark white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived at Katrina&#39;s place, she greeted him with a sneer. &#34;Alexander, you&#39;re completely useless.You couldn&#39;t even manage such a small issue. Now,you&#39;ve humiliated yourself on a national scale. And you still believe you can win Daniela back? That&#39;s nothing but a pipe dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot Katrina a frosty glare. &#34;You were the one who pushed me into this mess. Let me tell you,Katrina-if the Bennett family goes under, i&#39;ll be on your shoulders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having said that, he grabbed his luggage and walked out without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he approached his car, his eyes caught sight of Joyce standing under a sprawling tree across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a derisive smile as she watched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had no intention of engaging and silently reached for his car door, but her voice rang out unexpectedly. &#34;I can help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze mid-motion and turned to scrutinize her with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that,&#34; Joyce said coolly. &#34;Doug may have his flaws, but when it comes to money,he&#39;s never stingy. In all of Olisvine, aside from Daniela, I&#39;m your only chance at help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was indifferent to money and lavishly generous with the women in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, tossing out a billion dollars was barely a stretch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce noticed the change in Alexander&#39;s eyes and gave him a casual smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her wrist, showing overlapping red marks -some faint, others disturbingly deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was unsettling, but she didn&#39;t seem to care at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the catch?&#34; Alexander finally asked, his voice guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you always look down on me? Didn&#39;t you believe I&#39;d open my legs for money, letting men treat me as they pleased? Fine, Alexander. If you want my help, then you&#39;ll serve me in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned colder as she went on, &#34;You think I&#39;m low and worthless? Maybe | am. But you&#39;re not any better. I want to shatter that pride of yours and show you the true power of money-that even a once-proud CEO like you can be made to bow. Didn&#39;t you parade around in that ridiculous outfit to see Daniela? Fine. I want you to put on that ridiculous outfit again, kneel at my feet, and serve me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s words, though sharp as a blade, were born from a wound that ran deep. During the year she had been married to Alexander,she had endured relentless neglect and cold indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold, dismissive stares had been a torment that haunted her every waking moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander thought she was beneath Daniela, then she would shatter that illusion herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would strip away every ounce of his pride and turn him into a devoted, obedient slave at her beck and call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of his humiliation thrilled Joyce, sending a ripple of cruel satisfaction through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your dreams!&#34; Alexander&#39;s fury boiled over, and he spat, &#34;Don&#39;t even think about it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Joyce replied with a confident smirk.&#34;You&#39;ll come around. I&#39;ll give you two days, Alexander -two days to realize your place. If you do, put on the clothes you wore for Daniela and meet me at this hotel.&#34; She then tossed a business card in his direction,hitting him squarely. &#34;If you don&#39;t show up in two days, you&#39;ll lose the chance to ever seek me out again. So think it through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce turned and strode off, her high heels clicking with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Alexander would show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His insecurities and his need to uphold his pride in front of others wouldn&#39;t let him stay away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Alexander, Bennett Group was his everything-his identity, dignity, and sense of worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he was bound to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he did, he would end up being her most submissive slave.</p>
