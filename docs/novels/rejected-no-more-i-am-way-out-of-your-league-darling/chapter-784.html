                <p>Nikolas clenched his fists. &#34;You&#39;re insane, Daniela!Seriously,have you lost it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head and smiled. &#34;Oh? Is that what you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth, ready to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his head, one thing was clear-Hamilton never bowed to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is on me. My dad has nothing to do with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed steady, her words measured. &#34;Sure, it&#39;s your mess. But let&#39;s not forget who raised you. Nikolas,the influence you carry-who handed that to you? It all pointed back to Hamilton. A kid mirrors the one who raised him. And manners? They come from home.Weren&#39;t you the one who told everyone Cedric was just a bastard son with no manners to speak of? Now,I want everyone to see who&#39;s really unfit. There&#39;s nothing left to discuss. Unless Hamilton owns up to this, I&#39;ll make sure McCoy Group keeps sinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot her a glare sharp enough to cut glass.&#34;I did call Cedric a bastard son, and I meant every word. My father&#39;s never going to apologize Daniela, back off. Push me any further and you&#39;ll see just how cruel I can be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even flinch. She gave a slow nod. &#34;Is that so?Then I&#39;d like to see what cruelty looks like on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burning with rage, he turned on his heel and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What threw him off was what happened later that night-Hamilton sent Daniela an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed it aside. But Hamilton wasn&#39;t the type to let things go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came knocking himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He greeted her with a smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you do know how to keep someone waiting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Can we speak somewhere private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond. She just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried again. &#34;Cedric&#39;s caught up, so it&#39;s just you and me. I&#39;ve booked a table at my restaurant. Would you share a meal with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised a brow and replied coolly, &#34;Sorry. These days, I eat where I call the shots. My restaurant serves the best meals anyway. This one&#39;s on me. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile twitched, stiffening until it looked more like a grimace.Any other day, he would&#39;ve snapped by now. But today,he bit it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small gesture with his hand. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll go with what you&#39;ve planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together toward the newly opened restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed the menu without a hint of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been drowning in work all week, so she decided to try some of the new dishes while she had the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ate like she had all the time in the world, while Hamilton didn&#39;t touch a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCoy Group&#39;s stock had crashed hard that morning.It caught him completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the downward spiral didn&#39;t stop, he would lose his title as the world&#39;s richest person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve been in Oiscoll long enough to know how things work here. I won&#39;t waste your time. I came because I need this whole thing to stop. Like it or not,Cedric belongs to the McCoy family. He&#39;s my son just as much as the others. This is spiraling out of control.People are starting to mock it. Let&#39;s put this behind us.Can we agree on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela forked up a bite of vegetables and took her  time chewing. She gave a small nod</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing he expected was her agreeing so fast He almost smiled-until she spoke again. &#34;I&#39;ve got terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wiped the smile clean off his face. &#34;We&#39;re family Why would we need terms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t react to his words. &#34;Nikolas came to see me earlier. I told him I want you to apologize in person.Not to me. To Cedric. Second, I didn&#39;t come to Oiscoll by chance. Hand me the culprit. Then we&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the first demand was a blow. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to apologize to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for her second demand? There was no way he could meet it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice turned sharp. &#34;Daniela, this is ridiculous.Why are you doing this? Does it mean nothing to you that Cedric is my son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh, barely amused. &#34;He only has a grandmother who brought me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze and locked eyes with Hamilton.&#34;You never raised him. Not even once. Now that he&#39;s here, have you ever cared for him? Have you ever  acknowledged him from the bottom of your heart?You&#39;re just weighing the benefits. You&#39;re observing whether he meets your expectations for a good son.You&#39;re measuring him like a product. If he fits your mold,you&#39;ll call him your son. But if he doesn&#39;t, he stays the bastard son Nikolas claimed. The one reporters whisper about. The son you refuse to name.Cedric doesn&#39;t mind all this, but I do. I&#39;ve got a temper, and I hold grudges. So don&#39;t pretend this family bond is set in stone. That excuse won&#39;t fly with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton couldn&#39;t say anything. Fury had stolen his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary, standing nearby, looked like he&#39;d seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had openly challenged Hamilton</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stepped outside fast and dialed Nikolas,repeating everything he&#39;d heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy turned pale. That&#39;s how angry he was.He didn&#39;t even touch his food. Reporters caught us as we left. Daniela made a joke, said your dad was too scared to eat his own restaurant and now dines at hers instead. Then she smiled for the cameras and posed with him. The photo&#39;s already viral. People online are tearing him apart. They&#39;re saying if even the owner avoids his own restaurant, there must be something shady going on. Daniela knows exactly what she&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>doing. She made her restaurant look like the best in town without lifting a finger. When I walked out,I heard your father giving new orders. He wants the whole team eating only at McCoy Group&#39;s restaurant for the next month. Media included. All just to save face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary shivered, remembering it all. Daniela wasn&#39;t just smart. She was terrifying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, take my advice. Stop going against Daniela.Even your father couldn&#39;t walk away unscathed. If you keep going after her, I have no clue what she&#39;ll do next. But if she keeps this up, your father is going to lose it. Since he refuses to admit Cedric&#39;s his son, let&#39;s stop stirring the pot.&#34;</p>
