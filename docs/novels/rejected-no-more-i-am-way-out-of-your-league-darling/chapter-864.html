                <p>Hamilton grabbed the pen and scribbled a few notes on the proposal. &#34;In these parts, your review is far from complete. You can&#39;t honestly believe this proposal is ready for bidding; it&#39;s a total embarrassment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at the spots Hamilton had marked-the same ones Cedric had pointed out earlier</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together, then started to explain his idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked in surprise, but it vanished quickly &#34;You need all that time just to think over something l threw together? That just shows you lack talent Nikolas, you&#39;re my son. I know you better than anyone else. You just don&#39;t have it in you. If you did, after all these years by my side, you wouldn&#39;t still need to check with others on these things. The right path is sticking honestly by me. I&#39;m the only one patient enough to guide you. Cedric and Daniela are backing you now because they want to win you over. But sooner or later, they&#39;ll get fed up with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Hamilton added, &#34;That&#39;s enough. I&#39;m done talking. If you can&#39;t see reason after all I&#39;ve said.there&#39;s nothing left for me to do. We&#39;re having family dinner on Sunday. You&#39;ve been away for a bit. Make sure you come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Hamilton, his pride fully restored in front of Nikolas,strutted out like a king leaving his court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen, staring at the proposal in his hand, feeling like his heart had dropped straight through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately,Daniela always felt sleepy, so Carol suggested they head home early. &#34;Tell Cedric to start dinner.I&#39;ll call Damon and ask him to come. Nikolas went to that bidding meeting today, right? He left this morning confident-he&#39;s gotta have good news. Let&#39;s celebrate with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say a word against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been swamped recently,busying dealing with McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela and Carol decided to leave early.Cedric was still caught up in a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They told Cedric&#39;s secretary to pass along the message, then Daniela and Carol made their way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before they got home, Carol spotted someone squatting by the villa&#39;s entrance. &#34;Is that Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head to see.Outside,rain poured down hard, and there was Nikolas,crouched on the doorstep.soaked through, looking as lost and miserable as a stray dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Carol hurried over</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;Daniela asked.&#34;Did you lose the bid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain dripped from Nikolas&#39; lashes like tiny diamonds falling to the ground,sparkling like tears</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, realizing Daniela was home. quickly finished his work and headed back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, their eyes met in a silent exchange</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hung his head low, defeated. &#34;Father was right.I can&#39;t get anything important done. I&#39;m useless. Even with all your help. I still blewthe bidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a relieved sigh. &#34;I thought it was something worse. Come on in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, still downcast, muttered, &#34;I&#39;m worthless.don&#39;t deserve to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot Carol a quick glance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shrugged and said, &#34;It&#39;s okay, everyone has bad days. The world&#39;s packed with failures. You&#39;re nothing special. Besides,without folks like you,how would the smart ones shine.huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was left speechless. What a way to comfort someone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was quiet too. Was Carol really comforting Nikolas or just making things worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked like he might break down and cry any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dinner. Nikolas stayed still,barely moving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol cracked a few jokes, but Nikolas didn&#39;t even crack a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,she glanced at Daniela with a pleading look</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;Let me review your proposal again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas passed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed it and gave Cedric a thumbs-up.′′lt′s really detailed and thorough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela also worked on proposals, but usually just jotted down quick notes.Cedric,however,was careful in everything he did, especially in business, making sure no detail slipped by. The advice he gave Nikolas was almost perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidding isn&#39;t only about the proposal; it&#39;s also how you handle yourself. So, who did you see before the  meeting? Did something mess with your head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, surprised. &#34;I saw my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, sounding casual. &#34;Oh, did he put you down again? Did you check who actually won the bid this time?&#34;</p>
