                <p>Alexander stood motionless, his eyes locked on Daniela, unable to believe what he was hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face remained impassive and her gaze never once met his. Her profile was serene yet cold, a detachment that sent a jolt of unease through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Alexander inhaled deeply, trying to steady his racing heart. &#34;You don&#39;t trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,thrilled by the drama, pretended to be stunned and covered her mouth dramatically. &#34;Daniela! What did you just say? You don&#39;t trust Alexander? The man you loved for ten years! The man you married! And now you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t trust him to take care of this for you? You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused deliberately, her words suspended in the air,intensifying Alexander&#39;s discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s fists clenched at his sides, his pride stinging from the blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what are you implying?&#34; he demanded, his tone sharp as his gaze bore into her. &#34;Do you think I&#39;ll try to pocket the money? Or do you think I&#39;d side with someone else?&#34; Recently, Alexander had been reflecting on the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories resurfaced in quiet, unassuming moments, and with each passing thought, he realized how much Daniela had sacrificed for him. She had bent her own rules for him time after time, yet he had never truly appreciated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These revelations stirred something deep within him.He had come today hoping for a chance to repair their broken bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come with honest intentions. And what did he receive in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was stunned to find that his rare display of goodwill was met with this. He felt a deep sting of insult.He couldn&#39;t believe Daniela would turn on him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with her, he pressed on, &#34;Daniela, do you really think so little of me? That I can&#39;t tell right from wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t actually think Alexander would embezzle.She simply wanted nothing more to do with him. After all, hadn&#39;t he always chosen Katrina and her daughter? And now, he was acting wounded? Who was he trying to deceiv/e?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood behind Daniela, silently watching the  scene, his face betraying no emotion. But inside, he knew exactly what was unfolding. Men always had a way of seeing through each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So now, Alexander regretted it? He wanted to fix things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re being too harsh,&#34; Katrina interjected,attempting to play the role of the peacemaker.&#34;Look at Alexander-you&#39;ve hurt him deeply. You can&#39;t just erase the past because you have someone new in your life. Your father and I are family;no matter how much you hurt us, we&#39;ll accept it. But Alexander isn&#39;t.You&#39;re divorced,remember? Is it fair to target him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned and was about to speak when Daniela raised a hand to stop him. She then turned to face Katrina,her gaze sharp and cutting like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s confidence wavered, her heart pounding as Daniela&#39;s cold stare pierced through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, there&#39;s no need for you to add fuel to the fire.I stopped caring about Alexander a long time ago.Don&#39;t think you can use the past to manipulate me.Let me be clear-I do what I want. As for you,you can plot all you want, but it&#39;ll be in vain. I tolerated you before, but not anymore. Soon enough, you&#39;ll long for the dayswhen I was more patient with you.&#34; Her words were sharp and blunt, leaving Katrina completely humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to fire back, but before she could say anything, Daniela spoke first. &#34;Just days after my mother passed away, you moved into my house. A woman like you has no right to talk about morals or decency. Honestly, I thought you&#39;d lost any shred of shame long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shook with fury, her finger accusingly jabbing toward Daniela. &#34;Daniela! I&#39;m still your stepmother!How dare you speak to me this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes fixed on Katrina&#39;s sharply pointed red nail, the bold gesture only fueling her anger. Slowvly her expression hardened and her gaze deepened with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Alexander scowled and snapped,&#34;Daniela, have you lost it? Do you even hear what you&#39;re saying? Calling Katrina that way means you&#39;re calling Caiden indecent too. He&#39;s your father, andhe&#39;s lying in that bed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s rage exploded. It had been years since anyone had the audacity to speak to her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she known Daniela would cause so much trouble,she would&#39;ve taken care of Daniela along with her mother all those years ago. She thrust her finger even closer to Daniela&#39;s face and screamed, &#34;Daniela! You ungratefuI little brat! You&#39;re nothing but a motherless orphan! I&#39;ll teach you a lesson for your father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the words left Katrina&#39;s mouth, a loud crack rang out through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the whole room went completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Katrina froze, her mouth agape in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, Joyce froze, her face drained of color in surprise. The thermos she had been holding slipped from her grip and crashed to the floor with a loud clang.</p>
