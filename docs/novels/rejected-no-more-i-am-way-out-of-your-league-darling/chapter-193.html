                <p>Caiden was furious. &#34;So, you&#39;re telling me the company won&#39;t be handing out dividends right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained focused on her phone and didn&#39;t even spare him a glance. Caiden&#39;s frustration boiled over at this. He wanted to smash her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s any profit, we&#39;ll distributing dividends of course,&#34; Daniela answered, her voice calm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was left frozen, speechless. Profit? With the company losing money hand over fist, the idea of making a profit seemed absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he wasn&#39;t getting through, he changed his approach. &#34;In that case, I&#39;ll need to borrow money from the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his shock, Daniela agreed right away.&#34;Sure Caiden blinked, taken aback. He had expected a firm rejection, not this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response left him momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wide grin spread across his face as he decided to push further. &#34;I need to borrow ten million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Daniela replied again, her tone still casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Caiden&#39;s face quickly faded, a sense of unease creeping in. There was something about how easily she agreed that didn&#39;t sit right with him. He furrowed his brow, his voice tinged with suspicion.&#34;Why are you being so generous all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up at him briefly, herlips curling into a small, almost playful smile. &#34;You&#39;re running low on cash. How could I be so heartless, right? You were my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, he felt a glimmer of relief. Just as he was about to thank her for showing some compassion, Daniela continued, &#34;And since you likely won&#39;t be able to repay it, it&#39;s no problem-you can always use your shares to cover it. Of course,borrowingfrom the company requires a promissory note, and the interest rate will be higher than what the bank offers. Just so you&#39;re clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face darkened, his momentary relief evaporating, replaced by fresh anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric sat across the room, absorbed in a game. As he listened to Daniela&#39;s words, a faint smirk curled on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his fists, the tension in his body growing as his frustration surged. He was itching to lash out, to let his anger explode, but Cedric&#39;s presence kept him in check. &#34;Cedric, it seems like you&#39;re quite at ease making my villa your personal space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unbothered, gave a slight nod. &#34;Exactly. I&#39;m thinking about buying this villa once you put it on the market. For now, I thought I&#39;d stay here and get a feel for the place. With your business sense, I doubt it&#39;ll be long before this villa goes to auction.&#34; Caiden instantly picked up on the mocking tone in their voices. His face flushed with rage and he stormed out with a forceful snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he left, Cedric&#39;s calm and measured voice followed him. &#34;If you&#39;re truly in need of money,feel free to borrow from me. I quite like this villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Caiden like a slap to the face,causing his anger to explode. He stormed downstairs, grabbed a vase, and hurled it to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, it was a vase that Daniela had brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the bill for the vase came, Caiden&#39;s face turned red. He couldn&#39;t even scrape together enough money to pay for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, he had no choice but to sign a promissory note and reluctantly hand it over to Lillian before slinking back to his room in shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living without any money was torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Katrina had offended his mother and brothers, Caiden couldn&#39;t borrow a single cent from them.With no other options, he had to venture out himself to drum up business for Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stood on the balcony, her brow furrowed in frustration. Holding her phone to her ear, she sighed and said, &#34;Mom, can you ease up on your spending?Caiden&#39;s out of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end was cutting and full of mockery.&#34;Caiden? That man can&#39;t even take care of his own daughter. What good is he to you? Katrina,you married him to have a better life. If he can&#39;t provide that, then maybe it&#39;s time for you to start considering your options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina bit her lip, her voice hesitant. &#34;Mom, it hasn&#39;t reached that point yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If things don&#39;t improve, you&#39;ll need to make a move.Caiden&#39;s nothing but a freeloader. Haven&#39;t you figured that out after all this time? He had a golden opportunity and blew it. Do you really think you can count on him in the future? Like l&#39;ve said before,there&#39;s a rich man who likes you. If Caiden doesn&#39;t work out, why not move on? Why waste your time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pressed her lips into a tight line. &#34;I&#39;ve been living with Caiden for so long. I can&#39;t bring myself to divorce him and marry another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end scoffed. &#34;Being kind to a man gets you nowhere, Katrina. You&#39;ve endured enough, and so have I. Caiden isn&#39;t someone you can rely on. Marrying him was your first step toward a better life. Now,it&#39;s time to move forward. Don&#39;t let him hold you back any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared out at the trees swaying gently in the distance, her mind racing. For a moment, she was unsure of what step to take next.</p>
