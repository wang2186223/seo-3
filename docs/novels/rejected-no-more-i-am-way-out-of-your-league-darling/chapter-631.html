                <p>Richard arrived at Elite Lux, his smile unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio stepped into the first-floor cafeteria and settled at their table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard wore a flawlessly tailored suit, every seam perfectly in place, while his slicked-back hair gleamed under the lights. Stepping inside with practiced ease,he greeted Daniela with a smooth, &#34;My dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his warmth with an icy edge. &#34;Just call me Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard hesitated briefly but soon regained his smile.&#34;You never fail to tease, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shared a quick look with himbefore turning to Daniela. &#34;Daniela, go ahead and order. I need to use the restroom, and will be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before disappearing down the hallway,Alexander paused, pulled out his phone, and discreetly snapped a picture of Richard and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The framing wNas impeccable-deliberate and telling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image painted an intimate scene-Daniela, mid-  gesture, inviting Richard to sit, while he beamed with apparent delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face was alight with an almost triumphant grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander forwarded the picture to Cedric Along with the photo, he sent a message. &#34;We&#39;re having a lovely family dinner tonight. Talking about remarriage. Cedric,if you really care about Daniela, it&#39;s time to let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping his phone back into his pocket, Alexander strolled back to the table, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned in close, murmuring, &#34;Alexander sent a photo to Cedric. Want me to block it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s security system could jam signals, erasing messages before they reached their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skimmed the message Carol presented and,without a flicker of concern, said, &#34;Don&#39;t bother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a curt nod and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, still smiling, chimed in, &#34;What&#39;s the hushed talk about, my dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent, but Richard was relentless, flipping through photos on his phone like a man on a mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, my dear, what a pity you didn&#39;t come home  today. The house is nothing like you remember. Look at these antiques | brought back-worth over 80million. This snuff bottle? Over 60 million. And this vase? A solid 100 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard spoke with growing excitement, but Daniela found her appetite waning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,when are you coming home, my dear? You used to love it there. I&#39;ll cook something special just for you. The villa&#39;s been completely redone-so luxurious it made it to TV. You have to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard basked in his own self-importance, rambling on for half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Alexander kept his eyes on Daniela,quietly observing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed that Daniela was calmer than before,her expression unreadable-neither intrigued nor bothered by Richard&#39;s bragging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Alexander didn&#39;t intervene, thinking Richard&#39;s boasting was normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, wasn&#39;t success meant to be something a man&#39;s beloved could take pride in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard went on, &#34;Tired from work, my dear? I know organizing exhibitions lately has taken a toll on you.You&#39;re still young; don&#39;t push yourself too hard. If there&#39;s anything you need, just ask Alexander. You know, he&#39;s the president of the association now,holds a lot of influence. Most of the things that stress you could be handled with a single word from him. Daniela,young women should enjoy life, not bury themselves in work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s tone sharpened with a trace of irritation as he turned to Alexander. &#34;Alexander, Daniela lost her mother. She&#39;s been through enough. Don&#39;t make things harder for her. Help her, will you? Don&#39;t be like Cedric,always leaving her to fend for herself.You saw what happened last time-handling things alone can be dangerous. We all learned that lesson, didn&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded without hesitation. &#34;Dad,I get it.I&#39;ll look after Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander finished speaking, his eyes flicked to the entrance. Cedric had just stepped out of a car,his movements unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smirk played on Alexander&#39;s lips. &#34;Daniela,we&#39;ve known each other for years. Let&#39;s take a picture together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained still. &#34;I don&#39;t like taking pictures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her refusal, Alexander started to rise, while Richard had already struck a pose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was firmer this time. &#34;I said-I don&#39;t like taking pictures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ignored her, already lifting his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s frown deepened, and she was just about to rise when her gaze landed on Cedric, standing at the entrance,his expression shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers gripped the door handle, eyes locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the camera flashed,something inside his gaze seemed to fracture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, set a date and divorce Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single sentence was all Cedric heard, and it rang in his ears like a cruel echo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t bear another second. Turning on his heel,he stumbled out, barely keeping himself upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched as Cedric walked away, his figure weighed down by a crushing sense of defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh dear! The photo didn&#39;t come out well.&#34; Richard chuckled. &#34;Daniela, come on, look at the camera. Let&#39;s take a proper family photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek black car vanished into the night. At that moment,Daniela rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough for today.&#34; Her voice was sharp, unwavering</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Richard both stiffened, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela had already turned on her heel, walking off without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard blinked,momentarily at a loss. A deep frown creased his forehead before he muttered, &#34;Daniela&#39;s been acting different lately.&#34;</p>
