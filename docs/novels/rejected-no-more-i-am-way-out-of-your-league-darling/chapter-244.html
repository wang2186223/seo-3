                <p>&#34;I know a man of substance, Cedric Phillips, whom I&#39;ve mentioned before. He&#39;s often spotlighted in the financial press as a standout figure of our era. If Shirley pairs with him, she&#39;d be striking gold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, he&#39;s somewhat reserved, doesn&#39;t waste words, and can be quite austere. But that&#39;s hardly an issue. Isn&#39;t a touch of severity common among men,especially the accomplished ones like him? He possesses a razor-sharp intellect, and his reserved nature is hardly a drawback. If he&#39;s sparing with words, Shirley can simply fill the air with hers. I&#39;ve heard he hasn&#39;t been in a serious relationship before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Rest assured, he definitely has an interest in women! Cedric only has his grandmother, so the family fortune is bound to fall into his lap. If he and  Shirley tie the knot, all that wealth will be hers as well. Isn&#39;t that a thrilling prospect? Send Shirley here.She&#39;s met Alexander, right? Believe me, Cedric outshines Alexander in looks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was busy orchestrating Cedric&#39;s introduction in the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric, the very man Katrina depicted as having a frosty demeanor, had just emerged from a shower and was confidently striding into Daniela&#39;s room, a project contract in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Cedric set down the contract and approached Daniela. He casually took the towel from Daniela&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhearing Katrina&#39;s matchmaking efforts in the yard,Daniela chuckled. &#34;Katrina&#39;s turned into quite the cupid. We didn&#39;t come home together this evening, and she&#39;s already plotting your romantic engagements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed unfazed by Katrina&#39;s matchmaking antics.  He was more captivated by the challenge of taming Daniela&#39;s silky strands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up a bottle of essential oil, unopened and waiting on Daniela&#39;s desk, warmed a dollop in his hands, and delicately worked it through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair slid through his broad palms like threads of fine silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Cedric&#39;s eyes as his thoughts drifted. He chuckled to himself, realizing how marriage had softened his usual resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, he caught Daniela observing him with intense focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t necessary, it&#39;s such a chore,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian gifted you these over six months ago, and you haven&#39;t so much as cracked a seal. It&#39;s no wonder she marvels at your effortless grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her aversion to late nights, Daniela shunned elaborate grooming routines, yet her skin was smooth as porcelain, prompting envious praises from  Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all too cumbersome, and using all these just once seems wasteful. It&#39;s not worth the fuss.&#34;Daniela was never one for an extensive beauty regimen. In the harsh winter, she was content with just a dab of baby cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind the hassle, though. From now on, I&#39;l manage all your pampering needs.&#34; His words tinged with a hint of double entendre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s cheeks warmed with a blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric whispered in her ear, &#34;I could even assist with the body lotion.&#34; With that, he turned to search for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alas! Lillian had supplied everything but body lotion!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric surveyed the array of cosmetics on the table and resolved to secure a bottle of body lotion himself the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling slightly regretful, Cedric drew Daniela into his embrace.  Daniela&#39;s face radiated heat. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, trying to steady his fluttering heart,inhaled deeply and said with measured calm, &#34;You&#39;ll need to grow accustomed to my touch. We&#39;re married now,and I am, after all, a normal man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he spoke, images flashed through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, he pressed a kiss to Daniela&#39;s forehead and descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once downstairs, he took a cold shower to regain some semblance of composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, still reeling from the heat of the moment he&#39;d left upstairs, wondered if Daniela had noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she approaching to offer consolation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hopeful smile, Cedric strode to the door and flung it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; His handsome features darkened upon seeing the visitor. The smile vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The visitor, taken aback, bit her lower lip and lifted a basket of fruit. &#34;I&#39;m Shirley Randall. My aunt sent me with some fruit for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft glow of the indoor lighting, Shirley timidly raised her eyes to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With just one glance, her heart skipped a beat, and her cheeks tinged pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She breathed in his crisp fir scent, finding herself enchanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that one look, she knew she had fallen for him at first sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley, bashful yet bold, extended her hand. &#34;I washed the fruit myself. It&#39;s really sweet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she subtly drew attention to her form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley knew her strengths well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With flushed cheeks, she looked up at him once more.  This time, she was even more convinced that he was her ideal match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s voice softened. &#34;Won&#39;t you have a bite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, his response chilly and concise.&#34;No!&#34; He shut the door briskly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Katrina witnessed the scene unfold.The sound of the door slamming made her jump too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lacked any semblance of chivalry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be he had no interest in women?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley had chosen her outfit with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attire, a light blue skirt with a wide neckline, was short and cinched at the waist, accentuating her figure perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Cedric be blind not to spare even a glance?</p>
