                <p>Natalie had a hard time hiding her disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thought repulsed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, the short and plump Linden seemed completely repulsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s leave it at that for now. Go finish what l asked you to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, unable to bear it any longer, turned to leave,but Linden grabbed her hand. He smirked. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re satisfied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then walked into the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie could barely stand it. Once home, she repeatedly sprayed disinfectant on her hands,scrubbing them ten times before finally stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood a few steps behind, watching as every trace of disgust, irritation, and nausea flashed across Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, just hold on a bit longer. Once Cedric is gone, things wil get easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still seething, Natalie grabbed the disinfectant again and sprayed it on her hands. &#34;Mom, I can&#39;t take this.Don&#39;t ever ask me to see Linden again. He&#39;s disgusting! Just the thought of him looking at me makes me want to scream. I can&#39;t stand that awful smell of his for even a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse patted Natalie&#39;s back soothingly. &#34;Sweetheart, I know this is hard on you, and it hurts me too. Once it&#39;s all over, I promise I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After washing her hands, Natalie turned to speak to Elyse, only to see Nina standing just a few steps away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Natalie asked coldly, her voice void of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stepped forward, eyeing Elyse first, then Natalie. &#34;So Linden wanted you all along. You lied to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie dried her hands with a tissue, her faceblank,as if it were nothing out of the ordinary. &#34;Yes, and so what? You&#39;re his woman now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave a bitter laugh. She nodded, then turned to Elyse standing nearby. &#34;Mom, so you knew from the start he was after Natalie? Why? I don&#39;t understand why you had to use me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse pressed her lips together and looked up, no longer feeling guilty. &#34;Nina, you&#39;ve never been the sharpest tool in the shed. Some might call it innocence, but others might say it&#39;s foolishness. In a wealthy family, you need cleverness and sense. You don&#39;t have either. You&#39;re not going to marry into wealth. Your sister, however, has been sharp since she was a child. When Daniela is gone, Natalie will take over her property. She can&#39;t afford any blemishes on her record. Nina, trust me-everything I&#39;ve done has been planned out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at Elyse in stunned silence. After a moment, she let out a bitter chuckle. &#34;So, you think l deserve to be sacrificed just because I&#39;m not smart enough? You really believe I deserve someone like Linden? You&#39;re my mother. Is this how you decide to treat your daughters, based on their intelligence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s heart sank in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned and pulled Elyse behind her.&#34;Stop dragging this out. It&#39;s already done. Once we have Daniela&#39;s money, I&#39;ll give you something to compensate you. Why the fuss? It&#39;s just a physical thing, nothing more. Why make such a big deal out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina fixed Natalie with a cold, unblinking stare. &#34;Just a physical thing? No big deal? You&#39;re my sister. You knew how much I loved Cedric and how much l wanted to give him the best of me. Not only do you want him gone, but now you&#39;re acting like it&#39;s just some small thing? Natalie, are you even human?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie furrowed her brows and turned to Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you&#39;re hearing this, right? Everything l&#39;ve done was for our family, with no selfish intentions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse immediately took a step forward. &#34;Nina,how can you talk to Natalie like that? She&#39;s your sister.What you said breaks her heart. Didn&#39;t she promise to make it up to you once she gets Daniela&#39;s inheritance? Why are you being so ungrateful and unreasonable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a bitter laugh. The weight of it all hit her hard. Natalie blamed her, and Elyse remained so obviously on Natalie&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart ached as she screamed, &#34;Oh, sure! It&#39;s all my fault. You two didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I&#39;m the one who was held down and taken advantage of by Linden. But you both act like you&#39;re the picture of innocence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Nina stormed up the stairs.A few moments later, her sobs filled the entire house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse let out a deep sigh. &#34;Why is Nina being so unreasonable?&#34;</p>
