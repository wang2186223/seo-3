                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes instantly landed on Doug&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted a hand and tapped the screen lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave.a small nod in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric winked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Joyce asked, her mood noticeably brighter after reading the message which she believed held the key to solving her problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dreams of a fresh start rekindled, she looked at Cedric with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric and Daniela seemed so engrossed in each other that they barely acknowledged her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked as if they might lean in and kiss any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, catching Joyce&#39;s gaze, and offered a faint smnile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Joyce caught that smile, a sense of unease gripped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew all too well that whenever Daniela smiled like that, it usually spelled trouble for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight tremor in her voice, she asked, &#34;Why are you smiling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back into the sofa with a casual air. &#34;It must&#39;ve been tough, huh? Not many people in this city can come up with that kind of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden glanced up at her words, his curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce straightened her posture and shot back, &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Jealous that l&#39;ve got someone who&#39;s got my back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce spoke, Cedric silently reached for Daniela&#39;s hand, ensuring it stayed out of Joyce&#39;s line of sight. Daniela&#39;s smile grew wider. &#34;Oh, absolutely. I&#39;m a little envious of how resourceful your mom is. She must&#39;ve put in a lot of effort, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had been quietly observing Cedric and Daniela&#39;s secretive hand-holding, but the moment he heard Daniela speak, he turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Even for married couples, it&#39;s not easy to come up with that amount of money so quickly, especially to cover an endless debt. Your mom must&#39;ve gone through a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words left both Joyce and Caiden visibly pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Joyce appeared uneasy, Caiden&#39;s expression shifted to genuine fear, as if terrified that Katrina had cheated on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched their reactions with quiet amusement, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she leaned back casually and continued scrolling through her phone, clearly entertained by the drama she&#39;d just sparked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shot up from his seat, his voice thunderous. &#34;Joyce! Tell me exactly how you managed to come up with the money to pay off your debt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s heart raced in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hundred million was an enormous amount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no clue how to come up with a believable story to explain it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the situation hit her, and she couldn&#39;t help but regret her earlier arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have kept her head down and stayed out of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re nothing to each other anymore,&#34; Caiden snarled. &#34;If I don&#39;t want you here, you&#39;re gone. And if Katrina has betrayed me, I&#39;ll make sure you both pay for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s obsession with his reputation consumed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of his wife betraying him was intolerable. He wouldn&#39;t stand for it-ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more the idea festered, the hotter his anger burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, he stormed upstairs, grabbed Joyce&#39;s luggage, hurled it outside the villa, and tossed down a divorce agreement he&#39;d already signed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Katrina to sign this! She leaves with nothing. This house belonged to my late wife, and it&#39;s got nothing to do with her! Both of you, out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Katrina stooping so low for money only fueled Caiden&#39;s rage further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was well past ten o&#39;clock, and no cabs ran through this villa district.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood at the gates of the villa, her tears falling silently down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night stretched on, growing colder and darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shivering in the cold night air, Joyce heard the sound of the villa door opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to find Daniela standing under the porch light, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered, &#34;Come inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sniffled, her voice trembling.&#34;Are you really that nice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked. She wasn&#39;t being kind-she simply relished the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kicking Joyce out would&#39;ve been too easy,too boring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nowhere else to turn, Joyce reluctantly hauled her suitcase back inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shot Joyce a furious glare before turning to Daniela.&#34;Why are you letting her back in? Haven&#39;t we endured enough humiliation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s anger was unmistakable, and Daniela could see it clearly in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she remained unfazed, her voice steady as she replied, &#34;You were right about one thing earlier.This villa belonged to my mother. You have the right to throw people out, and I have the right to let them in. When you brought people in without consulting me, it only seems fair I don&#39;t need your permission now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s frown deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed a faint smile, gazing down at Caiden. &#34;If I wanted, I could even throw you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face brightened upon hearing Daniela&#39;s audacious words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smug expression returned, her confidence restored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people never seemed to learn their lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden clenched his teeth, his eyes following Joyce as she lugged her suitcase upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the room fell silent, Caiden spoke again. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s your game? You clearly can&#39;t stand them,yet you won&#39;t let them leave. What&#39;s your point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained unchanged, her calm demeanorunwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I know them. When backed into a corner, they&#39;ll fight back,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Let them try. I&#39;m curious to see just how far they&#39;ll push it.&#34; Daniela chuckled coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was eager to see what desperate moves Katrina and Joyce would make next.</p>
