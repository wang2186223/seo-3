                <p>Daniela took her time signing the pile of documents resting on her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still focused on her paperwork, she asked casually,&#34;Has an hour passed already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly checked her watch and replied, &#34;Just a minute past the hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Perfect. No reason to call back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian paused, momentarily startled by Daniela&#39;s easy dismissal. After a second, she asked hesitantly, &#34;And the blueprints?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot her a look, and Lillian quickly nodded,catching the unspoken message. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the blueprints finally arrived, curiosity got the better of Lillian, and she couldn&#39;t resist peeking at them.2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously,how shameless could someone be? The design looked like it belonged in a royal palace -over-the-top and dripping with extravagance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy to splurge when it&#39;s not your own money, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian passed the blueprints over to Daniela, who took one quick look and threw them into the trash can without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Caiden had been sitting around for over two hours,growing increasingly restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes glued to the phone,staring so hard it made them ache, but Daniela never returned his call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression turned stormy and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out an exaggerated sigh from her seat on the sofa. &#34;Well, it&#39;s obvious Daniela isn&#39;t calling back.They say once a daughter gets married, she stops being part of the family. She&#39;s clearly not close to you anymore, dear. Maybe it&#39;s time to accept it.Relationships require mutual respect, you know.Pushing it won&#39;t lead anywhere good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained silent, his piercing eyes locked on the phone like he could will it to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes welled up with tears. &#34;Dad, Daniela&#39;s not going to give me the three floors, is she? Does she hate me that much? Is she still angry about what happened before? I already apologized. I was young and made a stupid mistake. I&#39;d even get on my knees and beg if that&#39;s what it takes. But even after all that,she still won&#39;t forgive me?&#34; 9</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce leaned against Katrina, the two clinging to each other as they sobbed dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless sound of their crying gnawed at Caiden&#39;s patience. With a sharp crash, he smashed his favorite cup against the floor and marched upstairs in afury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he was out of view, Joyce stopped crying instantly. She turned to her mother and murmured in a low voice, &#34;Mom, what&#39;s the next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stopped to think for a moment before saying,&#34;Get Alexander to talk to her. Daniela&#39;s always been the type to let her heart rule her head. She&#39;ll believe anything he says. If he steps in, she won&#39;t say no.Those three floors are worth a fortune. You have to make sure you get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded firmly, her eyes gleaming with resolve.&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Richard paced in the living room, chain-smoking cigarette after cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the sound of a car in the driveway made him stop and turn to the front door. &#34;Alexander, you&#39;re here.&#34; Richard crushed his cigarette into the ashtray and glanced at his son as he stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t fit the mold of a traditional heartthrob, but his icy demeanor and quiet arrogance gave him a magnetic presence that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard hadn&#39;t thought much of Daniela in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But ever since it came to light that she was the CEO of Elite Lux, Richard had started to see her in a new light. 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised to find his father still up at this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard settled into his chair and motioned to the one across from him with a commanding gesture.&#34;Take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed where he was, refusing to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard didn&#39;t press the issue; he knew better than to push the boundaries of their strained relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see Daniela today?&#34; Richard asked,breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded in response. &#34;I had someone dig into it,&#34; Richard went on. &#34;It&#39;s confirmed-she&#39;s the CEO of Elite Lux. What&#39;s your opinion on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated briefly, then asked, &#34;What exactly are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard leaned back in his chair and spoke in a calm,deliberate tone. &#34;I know Caiden wanted you to marry Joyce, but that was before we learned who Daniela really is. Now that we know she&#39;s the CEO of Elite LuX,everything has changed. Her status isn&#39;t just higher than the Harper family&#39;s-it&#39;s higher than ours. She&#39;s barely been back in Olisvine, and already, people are lining up to court her favor. You&#39;ve heard about this,haven&#39;t you? But here&#39;s where you have an edge-Daniela has always been in love with you. Blindly so.Between Joyce and Daniela, there&#39;s no competition.If you marry Daniela,our family would instantly climb to the top of Olisvine&#39;s social ladder. It&#39;ll save you years of hard work. For the family, this is the smartest move you could make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was brimming with confidence about the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Daniela&#39;s deep love for Alexander was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was convinced that if Alexander so much as lifted a finger,Daniela would come rushing back, more than ready to rejoin the Bennett family as his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Richard, Daniela&#39;s unwavering love for Alexander was an unshakable truth, something he believed would never fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, on the other hand, remained completely still, his expression unreadable and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when he might have agreed with Richard&#39;s certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after seeing Daniela earlier that day, his confidence wavered. Her attitude towards him was nothing like it used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hardly even looked at him, as though he were invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word had passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifference towards him was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard caught Alexander&#39;s silence and let out a scoff.&#34;Some things never change, do they? A fool for love then, still a fool for love now. You honestly think Daniela&#39;s any different? She&#39;s just sulking because you left her for Joyce. This is nothing more than a tantrum.Now that she&#39;s running Elite Lux, all you need to do is play along with her for a bit. She&#39;ll fall back into line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.</p>
