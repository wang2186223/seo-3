                <p>As Daniela made her way back to her bedroom, Joyce offered a saccharine smile and cooed,&#34;Sweet dreams,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina fixed Joyce with an icy stare and declared, &#34;You&#39;re coming to the hospital with me tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce blinked, taken aback.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re getting a DNA test!&#34; Katrina declared vehemently.|refuse to believe that someone as witless as you could share my blood!&#34;⑨</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house lay wrapped in silence, deep in the clutches of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the stillness, soft footsteps whispered along the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle knock sounded at the grandest door on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swung the door open, her eyes locking with Cedric&#39;s, who lingered in the dimly lit hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; she queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clutched a medical kit, her expression was a mix of sorrow and slight indignation. HHe gestured towards Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his gesture, Daniela&#39;s eyes fell on the faint red mark marring the back of her hand. Fresh from her bath, her damp skin made the mark all the more pronounced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re wounded,&#34; Cedric observed,,his tone tinged with a blend of accusation and concern. &#34;I saw it earlier.Now that we&#39;re alone, let me attend to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really just a scratch,&#34; Daniela dismissed. &#34;I&#39;ve weathered far worse storms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, she&#39;d suffered her fair share of nicks and cuts from pencil tips while immersed in herdesigns. Those injuries had been more severe than this minor scrape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s jaw clenched.&#34;May l come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped back, granting him entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric made his way to the sofa and set the medical kit on the coffee table. Without a glance, he commanded,&#34;Sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a note of grievance, as if he bore the injury himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amused, Daniela complied, rolling up hersleeve and presenting her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric maintained silence as he cleaned her wound with iodine. &#34;Keep this dry,&#34; he instructed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Steer clear of spicy foods, and lay off the soy sauce-it might darken the scar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela was about to acknowledge it, Cedric was already extracting a tube of ointment. &#34;This should work wonders. Apply it once the wound closes to prevent scarring. You shouldn&#39;t worry about any lasting marks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was gentle, laden with an undertone of self-reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was my fault today. I failed to protect you. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he finished, he discarded the used swab in the trash and stoodto leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could, Daniela instinctively caught the hem of his shirt. Her action was spontaneous.She looked up and froze at the sight of his reddened eyes.&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright,&#34; Cedric muttered through gritted teeth.1-should go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s grip on his shirt didn&#39;t waver.&#34;Why are you beating yourself up? Today&#39;s mishap wasn&#39;t your fault.That ashtray-I flung it myself.How does that implicate you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, then handed him a tissue. &#34;Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed the scratch if you hadn&#39;t shown up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s frown deepened at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally met her gaze again, his eyes conveyed deep censure. &#34;Daniela, can&#39;t you be nicer to yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Daniela was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been ages since anyone had cared enough to say that to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained still for several seconds before managing a weak smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you make it sound like I&#39;m some porcelain doll. I&#39;m not that fragile,&#34; she teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Cedric&#39;s eyes lifted, flashing with irritation. With a snort, he picked up the medical kit and stormed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Lillian entered, her expression puzzled. &#34;What&#39;s got into Cedric? Did he wake up onthe wrong side of the bed?&#34;</p>
