                <p>Alexander longed to be entangled with Daniela across countless lifetimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips formed a sinister sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the phone, Alexander said, &#34;The mercenary we&#39;ve hired will handle Cedric tonight. From now on.there will only be one Cedric in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he would be the only Cedric that Daniela loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce flashed a devilishly charming smile and said to Alexander, &#34;Wait for me at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rushed back home, captivated by Alexander&#39;s current appearance. Her interest in him had been reignited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She undressed Alexander and kissed him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drove home with Daniela, Lillian frowned and said, &#34;Daniela, that was Cedric just now. You denied it was him to save his face, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Lillan with surprise.&#34;Why would you think that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked even more surprised than Daniela &#34;Daniela, it&#39;s just us here. Why won&#39;t you admit it was Cedric? You used to not hold back like this.&#34;  Daniela laughed.&#34;I already told you; that wasn&#39;t Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could it not be? I saw it with my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Lillian spoke, she observed Daniela&#39;s smiling face and thought that Daniela must have been so shocked she was in denial, unable to confront the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver added his voice to the conversation. &#34;I saw it from a distance at the entrance. It looked exactly like Mr. Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled but remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car started up and made its way to Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was already there waiting outside. As Lillian stepped out, she squinted and exclaimed, &#34;Cedric.you&#39;re in trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had already come across the news online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was utterly stunned. As he clicked on the photos,a video appeared showing him. The way he was dressed, his movements, and even his small habits,were exactly like his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric hadn&#39;t been completely sure he had stayed at the signing event the whole time, he might have wondered if he had somehow sleepwalked his way to the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, it really wasn&#39;t me,&#34; Cedric confessed,feeling  a sense of guilt. &#34;Really, listen to me. I was at the signing event all evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze to him. &#34;I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but I was at the signing event. My colleagues can back me up. You might think they&#39;re just covering for me, but I can show you the surveillance footage.You know-What?&#34; Cedric stopped. He looked at Daniela, who was still smiling at him. &#34;You said... you trust me? You know that wasn&#39;t me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Cedric was shocked by Daniela&#39;s certainty,especially since after the news broke, everyone at Phillips Group assumed he had fallen for Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his grandmother had called to scold him harshly.How could Daniela be so sure it wasn&#39;t him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, I know you wouldn&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she meant was, that even if everyone else turned against her, she trusted that he would remain loyal.He would always be by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second,remember when you rescued me from the fire at my wedding with Alexander? You got a burn on the inside of your wrist. Even though the scar has lightened from treatments, I noticed the man tonight didn&#39;t have that scar.&#34; It was because of that scar that Daniela realized that man was not Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gazed at Daniela, his eyes filled with tears, like a child who had been wronged but suddenly found peace in the comforting presence of a loved one.&#34;Today,it felt like everyone misunderstood me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the glow of the street lamps, Daniela smiled.walked over to Cedric, embraced him,and whispered,&#34;I&#39;ll make sure justice is served for the injustices you&#39;ve faced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan stood by the entrance, tilting his head towards Lillian. &#34;See? Daniela really is remarkable. Cedric will never leave her side in this lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning a man&#39;s heart held more power than any physical attraction ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clicked her tongue and gave a thumbs up.&#34;Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,as Joyce and Alexander were caught up in their own drama, Joyce&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of breath, Joyce answered, &#34;So, is Cedric dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end was cold. &#34;What sort of trouble have you dragged me into? Are you doing this intentionally? You&#39;re not trying to buy Cedric&#39;s life:you&#39;re after mine, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce regained her composure a bit. She pushed Alerander away and stood up. &#34;What are vou talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I talking about? Do you have any idea who Cedric has for protection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused,Joyce asked,&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shadow from Cealmaur, an elite bodyguard known for his stealth and his ability to make kills without leaving a trace.Compared to Shadow, I&#39;m just a rookie.You know what? Forget it. Find someone else! This is a disaster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold wind drifted in from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood up. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned her head and stared into the night, lost in thought as she looked at his face that resembled Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there more to Cedric than just being a businessman? Did he have another powerful background?</p>
