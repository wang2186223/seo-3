                <p>Daniela had intended to head back to Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, she received news about air traffic control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the weather forecast, seeing that strong winds in Oiscoll had grounded many flights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had told her there was nothing pressing in Oiscoll and urged her not to risk traveling in such weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no option but to wait it out with Ryan and Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they dined at the restaurant, Ryan glanced at Daniea and asked, &#34;Have you recovered from your amnesia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian chimed in, &#34;Do you remember everyting now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;Haven&#39;t I already told you i don&#39;t remember anything? You&#39;ve asked me this question so many times over the past few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she finished speaking, Ryan and Lillian exchanged puzzled looks. Ryan responded, &#34;Really? I thought you&#39;d remembered everything&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian said, &#34;I thought so too When you talk to Cedric on the phone, it might not be as romantic as before,but it&#39;s still pretty intimate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it?&#34; Daniela asked, genuinely curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan nodded.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian agreed. &#34;For sure. The way you two talk seems like you&#39;re a couple in love. You&#39;ve only been here a few days, but you called him a dozen times a day Have you really forgotten everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed, about to reply, when a shadow suddenly loomed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, annoyed, and saw Alexander standing there, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she asked, her tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at Daniela with a gaze that bordered on obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t seen her in ages and feared he had lost her for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was until the McCoy family contacted him,and he was overjoyed to have the chance to see her again. He replied, &#34;I have some business here and happened to spot you, so I thought I&#39;d come over to say hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unfazed. &#34;Alright, Ryan, Lillian, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no interest in wasting time on past people or matters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised his hand to stop her Just as the photographer was about to snap a picture,Daniela had already stepped back a few paces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice carried a hint of sadness. &#34;Daniela,we&#39;re so far from home, and we&#39;ve finally met. Do you really have to be so distant? We&#39;ve known each other since we were kids. I&#39;m leaving in a few days, and this might be our last chance to see each other. Meeting tonight,it must be fate.Let me buy you a drink,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tried to tug at her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained stoic. She lowered her head,her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice grew heavier with sadness. &#34;Just one drink. After that, if you want to leave, I won&#39;t stop you. You wouldn&#39;t be so unreasonable, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Alexander, her emotions long since  faded.&#34;There&#39;s nothing to discuss. We all have our own paths to follow. There&#39;s no point in talking. Move aside&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was unwilling to let her slip away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had traveled all this way, hoping for a chance to see her again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I need to talk to you,&#34; Alexander said,moving closer, but Ryan and Lillian quickly stepped in his way. Daniela made her way to the other side, while Alexander called out after her,&#34;Daniela! Can you really be so cold-hearted? I have no ulterior motives.I just want to see you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela had already turned her back and walked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was out of sight, Ryan squinted and warned Alexander coldly, &#34;This is your one and only chance.If you dare to harass her again, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Ryan and Lillian turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they were gone, Alexander stepped outside and asked the photographer, &#34;Did you get the shot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer, frustrated, responded, &#34;No, you were standing too far apart. You weren&#39;t even in the same frame. How could I take a picture?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t naive. He wouldn&#39;t believe just any  photo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced at the photographer,desperation in his eyes, and asked,′′|Sthere any way you can edit the photo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer raised an eyebrow. &#34;What? That kind of photo is clear to anyone with experience.Besides, Mr McCoy specifically requested real photos If Daniela and Cedric end up talking about it,they&#39;ll find out the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ran a hand through his hair, frustration mounting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood it needed to be genuine. But he couldn&#39;t get near Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated briefly, then told the photographer, &#34;I&#39;ll wait for another opportunity to get closer to her.After that, I&#39;ll blend the real with the fake and present them to Cedric. Once he sees one genuine photo,he won&#39;t notice the rest aren&#39;t real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer retorted, &#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who said getting a few photos would be easy? You claimed you had a relationship with Daniela. So why are we talking about editing now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot back, &#34;What do you know? Daniela is just a little shy. We have a great relationship</p>
