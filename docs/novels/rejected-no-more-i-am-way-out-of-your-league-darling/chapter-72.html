                <p>Cedric refrained from using the company&#39;s funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he invested his own savings into the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler, staring at the long string of zeros in the company&#39;s balance, felt the immense burden of his role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, overwhelmed, and queried, &#34;You do realize I&#39;m the legal representative of this company, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, momentarily cheered by Ryan&#39;s approving text, gave Tyler a brief glance and responded distractedly,&#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler&#39;s worry deepened. &#34;As the legal representative, this money is technically under my stewardship too.Are you comfortable entrusting me with such a substantial amount?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The potential for misdeeds loomed large; with the access he had, embezzlement was a terrifying possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was no small sum; it was in the billions!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was aside from the vast sums already tied upo in the business. Funds were swirling through accounts like a torrential river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recent costs for entertainment and hospitality alone surpassed anything Tyler had ever encountered in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Tyler,the financial maneuvers seemed sheer madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cedric, ever composed, simply stated, &#34;It&#39;s all worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to look at Cedric, Tyler observed the slight dark circles under his eyes. Even Cedric, seemingly unbreakable, bore the scars of his ambitions. No one, not even he, could dodge the demands of hard labor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler silently pledged to himself-he would uphold Cedric&#39;s trust. He would not fail him. Among all possible choices, Cedric had chosen him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest assured, I won&#39;t misuse a penny of the company&#39;s funds!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered a faint smile and dismissed him with a wave. &#34;This company only needs to tackle one significant project. If you&#39;re driven, use this opportunity to carve out your own path. Should you have any queries, I or my secretary are at your disposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Cedric exited, eager to meet his team on the construction site to discuss the initial design concepts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He envisioned erecting a building on the North District land that would captivate and inspire for centuries,and his entire vision was dedicated to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric collected his hard hat and made his way to the site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the design plans were revealed, the team was struck mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Phillips...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several team members exchanged wary glances, uncertain whether to voice their thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; Cedric urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lead designer stepped up, hesitating. &#34;Earlier, you specified using only the finest materials and hiring top-tier engineers, with directors overseeing everything personally. So what budget are we working with for all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question came tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though not a finance guru, he could rough out the costs for the materials and labor as specified by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Cedric&#39;s standards, the project&#39;s expenses were projected to exceed 2.5 billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could such expenditure yield a profit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed far more probable they&#39;d face a substantial financial hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t the primary goal of a business to generate profit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the rationale otherwise?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team was baffled by Cedric&#39;s strategy. Day in, day out, he was on-site, meticulously managing every phase of construction. His expensive black suit was perpetually dust-laden. From laying the foundations to the final touches, Cedric was involved in every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became a common sight at Phillips Group: the chief secretary donning a hard hat, yelling updates to Cedric amidst the roar of drills and machinery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one occasion, Lillian and Ryan chanced upon the site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing the commotion, Lillian couldn&#39;t resist commenting with a thumbs-up, &#34;Since Cedric can&#39;t capture Daniela&#39;s heart, he&#39;s channeling all that passion into her business ventures. It&#39;s absolutely wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had just landed from a business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the airport, he checked his phone repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After realizing Daniela hadn&#39;t reached out, he scoffed, &#34;She&#39;s really keeping her cool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary, nearby, ventured cautiously, &#34;Might it be that she&#39;s not just &#39;keeping her cool&#39;? Perhaps she&#39;s moved on to better prospects?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a scornful laugh, oozing confidence with each word. &#34;Better prospects? Daniela? Sure,she&#39;s skilled in her field. But for a venture this large? She&#39;d never risk it with someone who&#39;s not up to par.She&#39;s too savvy for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander got into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his secretary began to speak, Alexander&#39;s phone interrupted with a ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Caiden, inviting him over for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander directed the driver to Caiden&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, learning of Alexander&#39;s impending visit, immediately arranged for a professional makeup artist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She selected a breathtaking dress, identical to one Daniela had once worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress was exorbitantly priced, but Joyce felt it justified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had pondered her future-running a business wasn&#39;t for her. Marrying well and enjoying a luxurious life seemed far superior, infinitely preferable to Daniela&#39;s relentless, work-driven existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother&#39;s advice resonated with her.&#34;Awoman should not overexert herself. Stay tender, stay gentle,and life will reward you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hadn&#39;t reached out to her in a long time. Clearly, he wasn&#39;t destined to marry someone of her caliber,a true heiress from a prestigious family. Alexander, however, remained a viable option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Alexander had jilted Daniela at the altar for her sake, a testament to his unwavering commitment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce reflected on this with satisfaction. Sharing her thoughts with Caiden, she found him receptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded understandingly, promising to subtly mention it to Alexander at dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They agreed it would be ideal for Alexander and Joyce to hold their engagement ceremony before the New Year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander&#39;s car traversed the North District bridge, he looked out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,his expression changed dramatically. The calm indifference gave way to sharp indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward abruptly, pressing against the window, pointing angrily at the imposing building ahead.&#34;What the hell is that?&#34;</p>
