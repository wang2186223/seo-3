                <p>&#34;Hamilton, I don&#39;t have time for your nonsense,&#34; Josh said, his frustration boiling over. &#34;Let&#39;s cut to the chase. Are you really going to stand by and watch McCoy Group collapse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton met Josh&#39;s glare with a calm, faintly amused smile. &#34;You&#39;re still as hot-headed as ever,Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s features twisted, a scowl spreading across his face that looked strikingly like their late father&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it you want, then?&#34; Josh demanded,voice rising. &#34;Are you hoping to see McCoy Group lose everything? Don&#39;t you have a heart, Hamilton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let his eyes drift shut for a moment. &#34;Don&#39;t pin this mess on me. I&#39;m not the reason McCoy Group&#39;s in trouble. And like I&#39;ve told you before, I&#39;m too old and worn out to keep fighting these battles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All four brothers frowned at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad pressed him. &#34;What are you getting at,Hamilton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton answered, &#34;It&#39;s simple. I&#39;m no longer young,and.I don&#39;t have the energy to keep running the show. It&#39;s time the next generation stepped up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brought a hush over the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stared at him, searching Hamilton&#39;s face.&#34;Then, who do you think should lead us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lifted his hands as if he were open to suggestion. &#34;Let whoever is actually competent take charge. Isn&#39;t that what&#39;s best for the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stiffened. &#34;Mason is currently leading McCoy Group, and the only reason he&#39;s in the hospital is because of defending the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Hamilton gave a cold laugh. &#34;Last I checked, Mason got himself hurt harassing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now you want an incapacitated man to take charge of McCoy Group? That&#39;s just ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton McCoy!&#34; Josh erupted, nearly lunging across the room before his brothers stepped in to restrain him. With a trembling finger, he jabbed the air at Hamilton. &#34;Listen to yourself! Do you even have a conscience?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, unbothered, sipped his coffee. &#34;I&#39;ve said my piece. Whether you like it or not, the decision&#39;s yours. So, what&#39;s it going to be? Keep a leader who can barely stand, or let someone competent take over McCoy Group? That choice is yours. My doctor wants me to rest, soI&#39;ll leave you all to figure it out.Do whatever you think is best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Hamilton got up and retreated to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the secretary who&#39;d filled in for Joseph entered and asked Hamilton, &#34;Mr. McCoy, do you think they&#39;ll back down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hamilton could answer, his phone vibrated. &#34;They&#39;re out of options,&#34; Hamilton replied, glancing at the screen. &#34;If we don&#39;ts seize control now, we might not get another chance. I&#39;m getting too old for this,anyway...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, eyes glued to the message on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary caught Hamilton&#39;s sudden change in expression. &#34;Mr. McCoy? Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared in disbelief, locked his phone, then forced himself to take a few steady breaths before opening it again. He re-read the message, making sure he hadn&#39;t imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, he focused on the screen. The words were plain as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, I mentioned this over the phone, but in case you missed it, I&#39;m following up here. Daniela has been unusually tired lately, and I suspect she may be pregnant. I just saw her go into a pharmacy, possibly to buy a pregnancy test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock hit Hamilton so hard that he fumbled and dropped his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he just sat there, mind completely blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela might be pregnant? He could hardly believe it. Daniela was expecting again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sat frozen for a split second, then quickly snatched up his phone and dialed the intelligence officer.&#34;Are you certain about what you saw?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer&#39;s voice came through steady but cautious. &#34;Mr. McCoy, it&#39;s true Daniela&#39;s been noticeably tired, but I figured she was just overworked. Her room is often busy late into the night, but I haven&#39;t gotten close enough to confirm anything. She&#39;s always on guard. Just now,though,she entered a pharmacy and came out holding something small. I couldn&#39;t get a clear look, but it definitely resembled a pregnancy test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s anxiety spiked. &#34;Wait until Daniela&#39;s gone,then ask the staff exactly what she bought.&#34; &#34;Understood, Mr. McCoy. Daniela just drove off. I&#39;l check now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept the line open, every nerve on edge as he listened intently for any updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the phone, Hamilton heard the officer approach the pharmacy counter and ask in a low voice, &#34;Excuse me, could I have whatever the lady before me just purchased?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clerk responded politely, &#34;Just a moment,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton heard the faint crinkle of a bag as the item was packaged up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, a new message flashed on Hamilton&#39;s screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swiped it open and found a photo of a pregnancy test, clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer&#39;s voice followed. &#34;Mr. McCoy, Daniela might be pregnant.&#34;</p>
