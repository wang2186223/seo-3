                <p>The photographers swarmed like vultures, their shutters clicking in a relentless staccato of chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The results had twisted the McCoy family&#39;s years of hard work into a cruel joke, reducing their prized machine to a laughingstock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; hands curled into tight fists as he slowly lifted his gaze to the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just seconds ago, Hamilton had been there; now, he&#39;d vanished like smnoke in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his mistake hit Nikolas like a punch to the gut-he&#39;d truly messed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela folded her arms. &#34;Nikolas, as a McCoy, why don&#39;t you tell us if the results are accurate or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas jaw clenched as he dropped his voice. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;toverstep your bounds!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised a brow. &#34;And who crossed the line first? You tried to humiliate me on live cameras.What was that,goodwill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; jaw locked, his face hardening like stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s stare turned frosty, her tone sharp as steel. &#34;Apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen, words choking in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed on. &#34;Weren&#39;t you the one demanding I apologize just a minute ago? But now that it&#39;s your mistake on display, suddenly apologizing is beneath you? Is that how you operate-loud when accusing,silent when it&#39;s time to own up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shut his eyes tight, rage simmering beneath the surface-if he could, he&#39;d erase Daniela from existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela, holding the damning results like a trophy, turned to the Hamilton brothers with a sly smile.&#34;Well? What&#39;s your verdict? Are these results accurate or not?&#34; The Hamilton brothers traded uneasy glances, teeth sinking into lips that had just moments ago been spouting arrogance. Now, not a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To call the results accurate would mean accepting the unthinkable-that dog was their brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they denied the results, it meant confessing their groundbreaking invention was nothing more than a spectacular failure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter which path they chose, both led straight into a trap with no way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they fumbled for an answer,laughter suddenly cracked through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton returned, a wide grin lighting up his face as he joined Daniela. Turning to the reporters, he spoke with a playful smile. &#34;Happy April Fool&#39;s Day! Just a little joke to warm things up and keep the mood light.But jokes aside, allow me to officially introduce my eldest son-Cedric! We&#39;ve already conducted a DNA test, and here&#39;s the proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Hamilton handed over the report, and the reporters swarmed in like moths to a flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters blinked in disbelief. &#34;Cedric&#39;s actually part of the McCoy bloodline?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, he&#39;s the eldest son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does that mean Cedric could end up inheriting the entire McCoy fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now it makes sense why Nikolas blew a fuse earlier. Cedric&#39;s arrival is clearly shaking up his seat at the top.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas caught wind of the whispers and nearly exploded on the spot, fury flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton stepped in smoothly. &#34;Let&#39;s not forget-today&#39;s a family event. A day to unwind and enjoy.We&#39;ll have a proper celebration soon to welcome Cedric back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice softened as he added, &#34;It&#39;s his first time stepping through our doors. Let&#39;s not drown him in attention just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm tone hit the perfect chord, and the crowd slowly broke apart, nodding and smiling in quiet understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret twisted through Nikolas&#39; chest. &#34;Dad! How could you confirm Cedric&#39;s identity so publicly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen echoed the frustration. &#34;Exactly! One test isn&#39;t enough to declare Cedric your son. We need something more accurate-something definitive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whirlwind of events left Charles reeling, his mind struggling to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric was officially embraced as a true McCoy, then the coveted title of heir would teeter on the edge of a complete upheaval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Daniela throw her fuIl support behind Cedric now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic crept across Charles&#39; face as he cast a nervous glance toward Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught it all. He glanced at Daniela, who met his gaze without flinching, then gently lifted her glass and tapped it against Cedric&#39;s with quiet affirmation.</p>
