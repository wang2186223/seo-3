                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother getting drawn into any more arguments. She turned toward Carol. &#34;Get our team moving. When the market opens today, I want-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; Brad raised his voice, cutting her off. &#34;Give me thirty minutes.&#34; He grabbed the report from the table and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton understood right away. Brad still didn&#39;t buy what Daniela had said. From the looks of it, Brad had never fully trusted him either. They probably thought he was in league with her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had gone to find someone else to examine the report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the building, Brad made a call. &#34;Lara, I need your help. Look at this report. Is there any chance for the company to survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara McCoy was Brad&#39;s daughter. She held a top executive position in a finance company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she glanced at the figures calmly. Then she choked on her coffee, startled. &#34;Dad! Don&#39;t tell me this came from McCoy Group!&#34; Brad felt a wave of dread sink into his gut. He touched the tip of his nose and gave a weak answer. &#34;Right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara was stunned. &#34;How did it get this bad? Uncle Hamilton always knew how to manage the business.How did you end up losing this many clients? Did something go wrong at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stammered, &#34;It wasn&#39;t Hamilton. These past few months, it was Josh who was in charge. After that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long silence followed. Then Lara&#39;s voice came through, quiet but heavy. &#34;So that&#39;s it. You walked straight into a trap. How many times have I warned you? Uncle Josh hides behind a smile. You can&#39;t trust someone like him. But you never listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad grew defensive. &#34;But Hamilton always looked after everyone in the family, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Hamilton and Uncle Josh are not the same. All Uncle Josh does is bring up the past and Grandpa&#39;s old ways. The truth is, Grandpa always favored him. And that&#39;s what shaped him into someone who takes from the family without guilt. You&#39;ve let him fool you all this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad could barely keep his frustration in check.&#34;What&#39;s the point of bringing that up now? And you&#39;ve got some nerve criticizing me. You graduated top of your class. If you&#39;d come home, maybe our branch would&#39;ve had a shot. Look at that report and tell me something straight. If someone like the president of Elite Lux tried to take over McCoy Group, how long would it take? What kind of plan would they need?How much money would they have to put down?Break it down for me. Make a chart. I want details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brad spoke, Ricardo and Ethan stepped out of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They heard the questions and gave approving nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then laughter came through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound threw the three of them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad blinked in confusion. &#34;Lara, what&#39;s so funny? Get started on the chart. Your uncles are waiting too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, are you serious? Did I really just hear you say that the president of Elite Lux wants to buy out McCoy Group? You actually want a timeline for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara raised her voice. &#34;You do know that person is the wealthiest individual in the world, right? And McCoy Group? What&#39;s that now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t appreciate her tone. &#34;Lara, what&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you trying to say we&#39;re not good enough?&#34; Lara didn&#39;t hold back. &#34;There was a time when McCoy Group could stand shoulder to shoulder with Elite Lux.But that&#39;s in the past. Now? This report is the worst I&#39;ve seen. The losses are staggering. The cash reserves? Just a few million. A company this size should never have let it get this bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara&#39;s tone softened as she asked, &#34;Wait a second.Just to be clear-are you talking about Daniela Harper from Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
