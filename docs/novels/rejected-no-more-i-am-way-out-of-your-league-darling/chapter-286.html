            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexander slid the divorce agreement across the table. &#34;Sign it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifty million in hand, Joyce signed the agreement,officially ending her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stood to leave, Alexander didn&#39;t even glance back. His only sign of hesitation was a brief moment of stillness in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lingered in her seat, a sudden emptiness settling over her. With a forced smile, she turned to Katrina. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m finally free! The divorce is done,and now I can go after the love I&#39;ve always wanted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out a heavy sigh. In her eyes, Joyce&#39;s history-having a child, ending a marriage, and keeping a boy toy- meant she&#39;d never find anyone better than Alexander. She shook her head. &#34;You&#39;ll regret this, Joyce. You&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a laugh, her disbelief evident. &#34;No, I won&#39;t. Mom, I&#39;m texting Milo. He&#39;s coming over for dinner tomorrow. I&#39;m going to marry him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt as though the weight of the world was crashing down on her, utterly drained by Joyce&#39;s choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela ignored the conversation entirely,her patience with the family drama completely spent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan leaned towards Daniela, his voice a low murmur.&#34;Did you catch that? Joyce just finalized her divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, Johan saw an opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Cedric and Daniela&#39;s friends absent, it was the perfect moment for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan exchanged a knowing glance with Katrina, who understood his unspoken intention. As she began to share her plan to hypnotize Daniela with Joyce, the latter marched out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the living room was immediate and thick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, visibly tense, sat in the dining room,watching the fondue pot bubble without taking notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, Johan&#39;s voice came from the living room, quiet but final. &#34;It&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked into motion, Katrina sprang from her seat,her chair teetering dangerously behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan, startled by her sudden movement, rushed to her side. &#34;Quiet down,&#34; he hissed, his voice urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gave a quick nod, her breath still shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they crept towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting motionless on the couch, Daniela seemed lost, her eyes distant and unfocused, as if she were in another world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan shot a questioning glance at Katrina. &#34;What  should I do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze turned cold, locking onto Daniela with an almost venomous intensity. Her voice was laced with frost as she spoke to Johan. &#34;Take her to the rooftop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding Katrina intent, Johan gave a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He acted quickly, guiding Daniela with steady hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled fiercely across the balcony, its strength tugging at Daniela&#39;s long dress as she stood there, almost motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fabric fluttered upward, caught by the fierce gusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was tossed around wildly, adding an extra layer of fragility to her already delicate appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina asked, &#34;She won&#39;t just wake up on her own,will she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan chuckled, sucking on a lollipop. &#34;Not unless</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone says her name. Relax, you&#39;ve done this before-fifteen years ago,remember? You&#39;re a pro.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out his phone, Johan continued, &#34;Okay, just a few more steps, and we&#39;re done. I&#39;ll head downstairs to cover my tracks. Transfer the money now. I&#39;m out after this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes flicked to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene mirrored what had happened with Brylee all those years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over Katrina as she transferred the funds to Johan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the transaction was complete, Johan checked the confirmation and leaned in close to Daniela,whispering the final command in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In an hour, you&#39;ll be jumping from this building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Johan pulled his cap lower over his eyes and turned to leave the rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before exiting, Johan paused and cast one last  glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, unease washed over him, as if Daniela could see through every layer of his plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the nagging feeling, everything had gone according to plan that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the unease aside, Johan shook off the nagging feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted his cap one final time before slipping away from the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone on the rooftop, Katrina remained,perfectly at ease.She had done this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An entire hour stretched ahead, plenty of time for everything to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian had gone out for dinner, and it would be at least three hours before they returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was stuck at an international conference,followed by a banquet, and wouldn&#39;t return until late that night.  In one hour, Daniela would vanish from existence,just like her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything Daniela had worked for would fall into her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A triumphant smile tugged at Katrina&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing at Daniela&#39;s face, so eerily reminiscent of Brylee&#39;s, Katrina&#39;s sense of victory swelled. &#34;Talent doesn&#39;t save you, does it? You and your mother are still nothing more than pawns in my hands.If you two hadn&#39;t been so skilled at making money, I wouldn&#39;t have ever bothered with you. But don&#39;t worry,Daniela. I&#39;ll take over Elite Lux foryou. All of it will be Joyce&#39;s. You and your mother were both so short-sighted,paving the way for my comfort all along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in her glee, Katrina almost forgot the frustration she felt over Joyce&#39;s divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money was all Joyce needed to have any man she desired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Alexander was a mere shadow of the  wealth Joyce truly deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family would soon regret their decisions.</p>
