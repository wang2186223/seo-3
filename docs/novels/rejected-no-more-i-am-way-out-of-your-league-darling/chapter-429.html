                <p>Daniela had spent the whole day sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon waking, she instinctively checked her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurst had tried calling her multiple times, but eventually, he seemed to give up and sent a few messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weren&#39;t you supposed to visit Shadowpeak Madhouse today? Where are you? I&#39;ve been waiting for you all morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from Lillian that you&#39;re stil resting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric is also taking a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, youth is such a gift. Take your time with the baby-making. I&#39;m not in a rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes for a brief second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she set her phone aside, a smiling face appeared beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; People often said Cedric had a distant air, but now, his eyes were full of warmth as he gazed at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s thoughts were a bit clouded, her voice raspy. &#34;Hmm? What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric placed his hand on Daniela&#39;s flat stomach. &#34;Do you think there&#39;s a baby in there yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love had the power to make people mature, yet also keep them young at heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found it amusing. She waved her finger, and Cedric leaned in, following her gesture. &#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela parted her lips and whispered in Cedric&#39;s ear, &#34;I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a baby growing inside me, but l can be your baby forever.&#34; &#34;You and Cedric have been together fot so long. Why are you two still so lovey-dovey?&#34; Lillian said from the dining table, looking at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric and smiled. &#34;You haven&#39;t gotten married, so you wouldn&#39;t understand the pleasures of being married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilian nodded and laughed, &#34;Marriage can be pretty scary,&#34; she remarked, then paused, noticing something.&#34;Did you see that? His ears are all red!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tapped Lillian&#39;s plate with her fork. &#34;Stop teasing my hubby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s fork dropped to the floor with a clang. &#34;Did you just call him &#39;hubby&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,who had been enjoying the moment just moments ago, suddenly snapped back to reality. Before Daniela could answer, he remarked, &#34;What? Do you have an issue with that? We&#39;re married, so it&#39;s only natural for her to call me her hubby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, he found it incredibly sweet when Daniela called him that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out an exaggerated sigh, tired of their constant public displays of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Daniela had planned to visit Shadowpeak Madhouse, but Cedric was being overly clingy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprawled comfortably across her lap, watching TV with a satisfiedgrin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled and sent a text to Hurst. &#34;Not coming tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurst&#39;s response came almost immediately. &#34;Huh?Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Cedric and said, &#34;My hubby is being a little clingy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurst was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clicked her tongue, shaking her head. &#34;No wonder they say beauty can be so distracting. Cedric&#39;s definitely like a seductive temptress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was more than happy to indulge him, and no one could object. Meanwhile, at the Shadowpeak Madhouse, Caiden was slowly losing his grip on reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was one of the top mental institutions in the country, but he felt like he had reached his breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is Daniela coming?&#34; he shouted over and over, his frustration growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was nothing like any other mental hospital-there were no indivídual rooms. Everyone was packed together in one big space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards didn&#39;t care about keeping order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone got hurt or even killed, it was just bad luck for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, people in mental hospitals weren&#39;t held responsible for their actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the grim warning Hurst had given Caiden when he first arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had been stuck in this place for three days, and each day, he was beaten relentlessly. Surrounded by madmen, he honestly felt like he was losing his sanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is Daniela coming?&#34; Caiden screamed in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you speak her name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hurst could reply, Caiden turned and saw a group of men glaring at him, their eyes cold and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, he almost came close to losing his life in that hellhole.</p>
