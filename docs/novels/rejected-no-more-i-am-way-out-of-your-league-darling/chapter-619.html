                <p>Weary from his earlier shouting, Caiden sat on a small chair he had prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stepped out of the car and handed him a bottle of water. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve found a buyer, but he&#39;s offering less than we hoped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden momentarily stopped sipping his water.&#34;How much less? I hope it&#39;s not ridiculously low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce raised her hand, flashing a figure with her fingers. Caiden&#39;s brow furrowed.&#34;Really? That much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh of resignation, Joyce replied, &#34;What choice do we have? I&#39;ve already juggled some favors and forked over a hefty sum in agency fees just to get this far. The building&#39;s property rights are a mess,and it scares off most buyers. There&#39;s always the fear that someone from Elite Lux might stir up trouble. So,we might have to settle for this lower offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face hardened into a mask of stern resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had personally spread the news of Daniela&#39;s tragic demise, a strategic move to claim her inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering the violent explosion that had occurred, surviving seemed out of the question for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had anticipated Elite Lux to confirm her death,but even after three agonizing years of waiting, their silence was deafening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To complicate matters, a recent rumor had reached his ears-Cedric had miraculously woken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth could Cedric have woken up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosion had been catastrophic. Surely, Cedric was meant to perish in that disaster, just as Daniela had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Cedric now alert and very much alive, he posed a direct threat to the inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compelled by urgency, Caiden&#39;s thoughts raced towards disposing of the Elite Lux building as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, he planned to offload the Harper family&#39;s estate. Amassing such wealth, he envisioned a life of unabated luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in his schemes, Caiden turned around to address Joyce, his voice laced with determination.&#34;This figure seems fair. Set up a viewing for this afternoon. Secure some men to neutralize the guards,and get the media involved. I&#39;ll put on a show,claiming I&#39;m merely settling my late daughter&#39;s estate. would challenge me in public? Elite Lux&#39;s staff wouldn&#39;t dare cause a scene with cameras rolling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce responded with a sly grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had managed a narrow escape from Alexander&#39;s grim cellar three years earlier, the same day news of Daniela&#39;s tragic end reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that day, her eyes had been firmly set on the lavish inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,having later fled the madhouse, aligned with her, and together they plotted to claim Daniela&#39;s legacy and carve their path into the echelons of high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasted no time in rallying the media to their cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood defiantly, hands planted firmly on his hips,unleashing a tirade in front of the imposing Elite Lux building. &#34;I&#39;ve poured my soul into raising Daniela.Everything she owned belongs to me! You scoundrels!How dare you prevent me from claiming what my daughter left behind? You just want to leech off Elite Lux forever, don&#39;t you? Let me make one thing clear -Daniela is gone! She&#39;s not coming back! Remaining loyal to her is futile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then jabbed a finger accusatorily at the security captain&#39;s nose. &#34;Have you lost your mind? Daniela is no longer here, so why don&#39;t you pack your bags and leave? Why this pointless loyalty to her? But mark my words-after today, you&#39;ll be packing your bags and vacating Elite Lux!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden paused to catch his breath, then pressed on.&#34;Daniela was my daughter. Now that she&#39;s dead, her possessions rightfully belong to me. I want all of you off my property,now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, laced with disdain and bitterness, boomed through a loudspeaker at its highest setting, echoing his sentiments repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three years, this spectacle had unfolded daily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every worker arriving at Elite Lux was subjected to Caiden&#39;s relentless tirade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux was reeling, having lost its pivotal figure-its guiding lights-and confusion reigned among the remnants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bore the sting of defeat yet stood firm in their resolve. Voices around them urged surrender, proclaiming Daniela&#39;s demise, while asserting that Caiden, as her father, was the rightful heir to the inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, they remained steadfast, unwilling to abandon their posts. The minutes dragged on, yet they stood firm,refusing to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the domestic operations dwindling, despite the halt of all promotional activities within the nation,despite the company&#39;s failure to disburse salaries for almost half a year,despite it all...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company&#39;s legal director found himself driving a taxi to make ends meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not one soul from Elite Lux departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the cleaning lady of the building, committed to her role, kept the premises immaculate every single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She declared, &#34;Though my powers are limited, the cleanliness of this building reflects the honor of Elite Lux, and I am bound to uphold it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Daniela&#39;s arrival, she perused the attendance records at Elite Lux meticulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years prior, the expected attendance had been precisely 2, 056 individuals, a figure perfectly matched by the actual turnout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast forward three years, and the scenario remarkably repeated itself: 2, 056 anticipated, 2, 056 present-without a single absence. When Daniela stood before everyone, they couldn&#39;t help but weep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, these soft sobs escalated into an overwhelming wave of loud, unrestrained wails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, poised on the stage, executed a deep,respectful bow. &#34;Thank you all for your unwavering trust. Today, the finance department will be compensating for the past six months&#39; unpaid salaries by doubling them. Moreover, each one of you, all 2,056,will be endowed with original shares as founding shareholders of the company. Your support over these three years has been invaluable. From this day forward,I pledge to stand by you, ensuring a prosperous future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words trailed off, a profound silence enveloped the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if breaking from a spell, everyone, tears still gleaming in their eyes, erupted into exuberant cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their loyalty to Daniela had been justified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew that someone as powerful as Daniela wouldn&#39;t die easily.</p>
