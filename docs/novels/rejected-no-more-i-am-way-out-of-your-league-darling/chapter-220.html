                <p>Word of the Harper and Bennett families&#39; alliance swept through Olisvine like wildfire. Soon, every tongue in the city was wagging about Joyce and Alexander&#39;s impending nuptials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The social elite were abuzz, their discussions a fiery mix of gossip and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, radiant with anticipation, dived into the online comments, expecting a cascade of blessings and congratulatory messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, the harsh reality of public opinion shattered her buoyant mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce is marrying Alexander? Can my eyes be deceiving me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No deception here. Both Harper Group and Bennett Group have broadcasted it on their websites. The wedding&#39;s on the calendar for next month&#39;s end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander&#39;s decisions are a riddle wrapped in a mystery. He divorced Daniela only to marry her stepsister?What a tangle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Alexander lost his marbles? Trading Daniela for Joyce seems like a poor swap!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The lot of you are missing the point. Weak men choose partners they think they can dominate. Daniela is too much of a titan for Alexander-he probably feels dwarfed by her. Joyce, on the other hand, is cut from the same cloth as her mother. Both are completely dependent on their men-a type far easier to sway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember, Joyce comes with a child already in tow. Alexander&#39;s standards can&#39;t be very high, canthey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s clear as day, isn&#39;t it? She must be bringing a hefty dowry. With enough money on the line, the Bennett family would overlook just about anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face flushed a deep crimson as she scrolled through the comments. In a fit of rage, she slammed her laptop to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists clenched, eyes aflame with cold anger. Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she seen as lesser compared to Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine.She would prove them wrong!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wedding day would unveil a dowry so lavish, a procession so grand, they would all be left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line, she whirled around to face Katrina. &#34;When is Dad transferring his shares into my name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hesitated at the question. After a while, she responded, &#34;I&#39;ve discussed this with yourfather.The family coffers are thin right now, so we can&#39;t afford much. And his shares can&#39;t be transferred just yet-not until the company&#39;s fortunes improve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze. &#34;What do you mean? Are you saying Caiden isn&#39;t planning to give me the shares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that he won&#39;t ever give them to you; he just plans to delay it a bit,&#34; Katrina replied evasively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina recalled Caiden&#39;s words. &#34;We&#39;re strapped for cash right now, depending on Harper Group to stay afloat. If we hand everything to Joyce, what&#39;s left for us? What about Jack? Honestly, Joyce isn&#39;t Daniela.She knows nothing about running a business. It&#39;d be like throwing good money after bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood, stunned, staring at Katrina. &#34;Mom,you agreed to this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s cheeks colored with embarrassment. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to, but we really are strapped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice sharpened, cutting through the excuses. &#34;Then sell the other half of Harper Group to Daniela!You said because I was a mother before marriage, I needed a generous dowry to appease the Bennett family.Now you&#39;re backtracking? All this talk about being broke-it&#39;s just an excuse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted an explanation, but Joyce, too wrought with emotion, was beyond listening. In her fury,she shoved Katrina to the floor. &#34;You&#39;re all liars! Every one of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The venomous online comments echoed in her mind, mocking her, diminishing her, constantly comparing her to Daniela. Her resentment boiled over, spilling out in unchecked torrents. She glared down at Katrina. &#34;If you can&#39;t sort this out, I&#39;ll hate you all forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no constructive outlet for her emotions. When she felt aggrieved, she turned to retail therapy.If the world insisted she wasn&#39;t Daniela&#39;s equal, she would submerge herself in luxury, basking in the obsequious attention of sales associates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shopping always bestowed a fleeting sense of control. The ceaseless flattery from staff bolstered her ego and soothed her wounded pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Richard also stumbled upon the online comments about Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of &#34;dowry&#34; struck a chord, stirring his concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, did the Harper family clarify the dowry Joyce is bringing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was preparing for a business trip that wvould last over a month, and by the time he returned,it would be time for the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied nonchalantly, &#34;Didn&#39;t they outline it during our last talk? They promised all their assets to Joyce.Now, even though they own just half of Harper Group, with Daniela&#39;s prowess, that half is likely more valuable now than the whole company once was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s brow furrowed. The answer did little to alleviate his worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to probe further, but Alexander had already grabbed his suitcase and was heading out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander left with a definitive stride, showing scant interest in the wedding details. He left it all in the Harper family&#39;s hands, indifferent to theirplans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, however, couldn&#39;t shake a nagging unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolved to gain clarity, he arranged a meeting with the Harper family over dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dinner table, Richard cut straight to the chase. &#34;As for the bride price, we&#39;re planning to provide Joyce with 30 million in cash, a mountaintop villa, and a few other tokens. All told, it sums up to about 50million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, soured by days of discontent, finally saw a spark of joy flicker across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family still valued her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she had always believed that despite the world turning against her, Alexander would remain her steadfast champion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harper family&#39;s promises were of littleconsequence to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once married, she resolved to devote herself entirely to the Bennett family-to those who truly valued her.</p>
