                <p>Instantly, Hamilton stiffened, caught off guard.Recovering with a grumble, he snapped, &#34;What are you all staring at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, he crossed the room,grabbed the nearest mug of instant coffee, and took a gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grimace twisted his face at the bitter taste.&#34;Seriously, Daniela? You&#39;re supposed to be rolling in money, and you drink this swill? Isn&#39;t that a little embarrassing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his foul mood, Daniela let out a weary sigh and glanced at Carol. &#34;Would you mind brewing Mr.McCoy a decent cup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save yourself the trouble,&#34; Hamilton said, waving her off as he turned to leave. Just then, his eyes landed on a patch of red on Cedric&#39;s neck. &#34;Hey, what happened there?&#34; Hamilton lifted his hand and directed Cedric&#39;s attention to the pale mark resting just above his collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric reached up, surprised to find a tender spot.He had hardly even noticed the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, his annoyance growing as he glanced at Daniela, unscathed, and then at Cedric.&#34;Look at that. Daniela comes out without a scratch,and you&#39;re the one who ends up hurt. What were you even doing-playing the hero?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the least bit bothered, Cedric offered a calm shrug. &#34;Nothing like that. I just stepped in for backup.I&#39;ve got a long way to go before I&#39;m anywhere near her level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The admission left Cedric feeling slightly embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An exasperated sigh escaped Hamilton as he rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time, Cedric fell short-couldn&#39;t beat Daniela in the boardroom, and now couldn&#39;t hold his own in a fight. The idea of these two living under one roof would mean Cedric being completely under her thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That scenario was unacceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela could single-handedly wipe out the assassins, then clearly, the entire McCoy family meant nothing to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he truly accepted the idea of Cedric and Daniela being together, then wouldn&#39;t that hand the entire McCoy family over to her? She&#39;d be the one in charge. Everyone would be following her lead, as if they were nothing but her personal staff. That couldn&#39;t happen. Not a chance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer Hamilton dwelt on the thought, the more wrong it felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intent on making his exit, Hamilton moved briskly toward the door. Daniela matched his pace to walk him out. When Cedric tried to follow, she stopped him. &#34;Go take care of that cut before it gets worse.&#34; Then she went to see Hamilton out herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy thud sounded as Hamilton settled into the back seat of the car. Leaning outside, Daniela gave a soft tap on the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the glass slid down did Hamilton reveal his icy stare. A sharp, impatient question left his lips.&#34;What do you need now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With à faint, steady smile, Daniela met his eyes. &#34;You called me ruthless earlier, Mr. McCoy. Just remember that if I ever catch you playing matchmaker for Cedric-whether it&#39;s with the princess or anyone else -I&#39;ll deal with your family just as I dealt with Josh&#39;s men today. I never bluff. Family ties won&#39;t make me hesitate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s anger flared in an instant. &#34;Are you seriously threatening me right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling,Daniela straightened her posture. &#34;Think of it mnore as a gentle reminder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting her attention, she spoke to Joseph. &#34;Thank you for your help today. Drive safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car eased away from the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither man spoke as silence filled the interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph looked at Hamilton&#39;s tense face through the rearview mirror. &#34;To be honest, Mr. McCoy, Daniela didn&#39;t seem that unreasonable. She even thanked us.That&#39;s pretty rare for someone in her position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too naive,&#34; Hamilton scoffed. &#34;Never trust a pretty face. Daniela&#39;s twice as clever as she is beautiful. Before you know it, you&#39;ll be under her thumb-just like Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph gave a nod, but his mind was on how Daniela and Cedric interacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying it. Cedric hung on to every word Daniela spoke, and it couldn&#39;t have been more obvious-she had him entirely under her spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, beauty had a way of blinding a man&#39;s common sense. Suddenly, Hamilton&#39;s face contorted in alarm. &#34;Wait a second! Why are those two brats still staying behind?&#34;</p>
