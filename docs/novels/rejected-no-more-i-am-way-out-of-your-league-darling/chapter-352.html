                <p>Flashing a smile, Daniela stated, &#34;I have a solid connection with Ryan&#39;s mentor. If Killian really pulls this off,I&#39;ll back him up as a spokesperson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, Killian&#39;s obsession with decoding the mystery deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric watched on with a blend of patience and anticipation, hoping Killian would master the cryptic code, apprentice under its enigmatic creator, and unearth the secrets Daniela had carefully concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as weeks turned into a month, Killian&#39;s frustration became palpable. He had anxiously tugged at his once lush hair, now thinning rapidly, but still, no breakthroughs emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing the answers might forever elude him, Cedric abandoned his wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resolute stride, he made his way to Elite Lux to confront Daniela in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as he approached Daniela&#39;s office, the secretary stopped him with a curt note that Daniela had left with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,hidden within the walls of the Harper family estate, Katrina had been living under a veil of dread.Now, forced into the open, her anxiety surged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their car exited the villa&#39;s gates, the driver turned, his face etched with concern. &#34;Mrs. Harper, we&#39;re being followed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of fear washed over Katrina, her complexion draining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive faster! Lose them!&#34; she commanded, her voice quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver nodded just as their car was abruptly rammed from behind. Katrina&#39;s head snapped forward,colliding with the seat in front of her. The impact left the driver scrambling to regain control, his hands trembling on the wheel. &#34;Hurry up! We need to move faster!&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice was laced with urgency as she leaned forward in her seat, her eyes wide with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, sensing the gravity of the situation, pressed his foot harder against the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car surged forward, cutting through the wind with a fierce howl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze was fixed on the road as the car swerved skillfully to dodge the other vehicles, her heart pounding against her chest. Despite the chaos, the relentless pursuit of the car behind them only intensified. As they took a sharp turn onto a narrower road, Katrina&#39;s hands shook visibly as she fumbled with her phone to dial Daniela&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment of sheer panic, it was Daniela&#39;s name that sprang to her lips-not Joyce, not Caiden,but Daniela, the stepdaughter she had wronged for so many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m in real trouble here. Please, you have to help me. If you do, I&#39;ll tell you everything,&#34; Katrina pleaded into the phone, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, Daniela&#39;s response was eerily calm, as she eyed the wreckage of a vehicle ahead,its front end horribly twisted. &#34;And what is it that you&#39;re going to tell me,Katrina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was quick to respond, desperation clear in her voice. &#34;Listen, I know you&#39;ve been digging into your mother&#39;s death. Help me now, and I&#39;ll spill everything. I&#39;m just a pawn in a much larger game. Don&#39;t you want justice for your mother? Save me, Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better not be lying,&#34; Daniela warned, her voice chillingly cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp turn and a heavy foot on the gas, Daniela sped away like a racer chasing the finish line. Back in her own vehicle, Katrina&#39;s breath hitched as they nearly collided with another car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, there was a massive thud-a sound that seemed too soft for the collision she anticipated. The car rebounded gently and rolled to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped the interior, punctuated only by the ragged breathing of the driver, who was just as shaken as she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina slowly opened her eyes, her gaze landed on Daniela, who stood firm, giving sharp, decisive orders to the emergency crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, Katrina forgot everything-hatred, jealousy, resentment, unwillingness. These feelings dissipated in to thin air. Overwhelmed by an unexpected sense of gratitude, she yearned to embrace Daniela in a thankful hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saved me!&#34; Katrina exclaimed, her voice trembling as tears brimmed in her eyes. However, Daniela&#39;s face was a mask of stoic indifference, untouched by Katrina&#39;s outpouring of thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was cold, dismissive. &#34;I saved you today. You better keep your promise, or I&#39;ll deal with you in the same way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart hammered in her chest as the weight of their recent ordeal crashed back upon her.&#34;Send me away. I need to disappear-somewhere far, where no one can reach me. Daniela, you bought an island,didn&#39;t you? That&#39;s where I need to be. Only there will I be truly safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Katrina felt a genuine regret for her actions towards Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t been so cruel, perhaps Daniela&#39;s kindness would have extended to granting her this escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But regret was useless now-the damage was already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere, Katrina. It&#39;s time for you to face the consequences of your actions,&#34; Daniela declared, her tone unwavering. &#34;Death would be too merciful for you. You have two choices-confess everything and turn yourself in, or face a much harsher fate. Choose wisely.&#34;</p>
