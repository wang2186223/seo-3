                <p>Alexander hesitated, his words caught in a tangle of indecision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatience etched across Joyce&#39;s face as she leaned forward. &#34;What&#39;s there to think about? Daniela doesn&#39;t care about your pity. Remember how she treated you when you begged for her help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent, gripping his glass of iced water as if the chill could settle his restless mind. His mind spun in circles, searching for answers that never came. He couldn&#39;t shake the image of Daniela trapped in Doug&#39;s cruelty, unable to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce caught Alexander&#39;s hesitation and smirked.&#34;Still clinging to the idea of being with Daniela? To achieve that goal, you must first make her Doug&#39;s woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked at Joyce in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s tone remained casual, almost dismissive.&#34;For ten years, you ignored Daniela, Alexander. That&#39;s not something you can fix with a few kind gestures.Now she&#39;s on top of the world and sees you as insignificant.If you want to stand by her side again, you&#39;ll have to  knock her off that pedestal first. Let her fall so hard that she&#39;s desperate for someone to catch her. That&#39;s when she&#39;ll need you. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s stern expression softened little by little as he listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce could tell her words were sinking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still planning to marry me, right?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am, and you don&#39;t need to worry. All I care about is the title of your wife. Once we have a child, I&#39;ll turn a blind eye to anything you do outside of this arrangement. But I have one demand: Daniela cannot bear any children. The Bennett family&#39;s legacy belongs to my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let the silence stretch between them, his brow furrowed. &#34;That&#39;s all?&#34; he asked,his voice tinged with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce offered a slow, deliberate nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had finally come to terms with the mistakes she made. Katrina had once cleared the path for her success, but she&#39;d foolishly wrecked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was determined to take control again,convinced it wasn&#39;t too late to set everything right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce still had a chance to right the ship, hold on to the title of Alexander&#39;s wife, and bask in the comforts  of wealth. Her son would inherit the Bennett family&#39;s wealth, ensuring her place in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Alexander, what&#39;s your decision? Are you in?&#34;Joyce let her words hang in the air, her voice carefully measured. &#34;Or You don&#39;t want Daniela anymore after Doug sleeps with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped her. &#34;Don&#39;t fool yourself,Alexander. You&#39;re not a virgin. What right do you have to pass judgment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, unmoved, took another sip of water.&#34;What is it that you expect from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A victorious smile played on Joyce&#39;s lips. &#34;I thought you might have some lingering feelings for Daniela,but clearly not. It&#39;s really that simple. Don&#39;t complicate things. Life at the top is always messy. A single night-what&#39;s it really worth in the grand scheme?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice was steady, laced with control, as she continued,&#34;I&#39;ve already made arrangements with Doug.He&#39;ll collaborate with Daniela&#39;s company. He&#39;ll flood it with money quickly to create the illusion of success.That&#39;ll give you the perfect chance to get close to her. Once she lets her guard down, I&#39;ll have someone hypnotize her. From there, it&#39;ll all unfold as planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease crept over Alexander,but deep down,he knew there was no alternative. A quiet vow formed in his mind: one day, he would find a way to make things right with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would buy a villa for Daniela, where he could keep her close and protect her from everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Daniela would ultimately be his, with no one else standing in his way.</p>
