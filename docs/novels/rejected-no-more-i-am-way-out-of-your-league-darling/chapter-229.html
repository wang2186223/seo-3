                <p>Daniela was sitting at the dinner table, surrounded by a crowd. Without raising her voice or stepping away,she stated coolly, &#34;I have no sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated before replying, &#34;But blood is thicker than-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden Harper!&#34; Daniela cut him off, her tone calm and indifferent. She didn&#39;t raise her voice, nor did she show any anger, but the mere mention of his name made everyone at her table glance up, their eyes narrowing. &#34;My mother passed away long ago,and I have no one to protect me. Do you think that makes me weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was struck speechless. After a long pause, he managed to say, &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant. But so many people came to the wedding because of you.Your absence is causing a lot of trouble for me.&#34; Daniela replied coolly, &#34;I thought I made myself clear the last time you came to see me. But since you seem unable to grasp it, let me be blunt. I don&#39;t go looking for trouble, but I am not afraid of it. I have no ties to you anymore. So don&#39;t call yourself my &#39;dad&#39;again-it&#39;s revolting. Also, the matters of the Harper family have nothing to do with me. Stop involving me in your mess. You wouldn&#39;t like the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, letting her words sink in before continuing again, &#34;Yes, I have no one to protect me.I&#39;ve known that for years. But that doesn&#39;t make me an easy target. It doesn&#39;t matter how many shares I&#39;ve given her. Taking you or Joyce down would be simple. And if you doubt me, feel free to try. I can make you smile one moment and have you in tears the next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were sharp, and her gaze emotionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no anger in her voice, no personal grudge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was simply business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden, are you willing to try?&#34; she asked. Caiden opened his mouth, struggling to find words.&#34;But I&#39;m still your-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; Daniela said,cutting him off with a slight nod.&#34;So you do want to try. Fine. Let&#39;s use Joyce&#39;s wedding to make an example.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sent a chill of panic through Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; he blurted out, but the call had already ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood motionless, staring at the phone in his hand, his face drained of color. Daniela&#39;s cold tone echoed in his mind, her words heavier than he could comprehend. He realized, with a sinking heart, that she truly didn&#39;t care about him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret ate at him. He regretted asking for that 5%shares of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted bragging to the guests earlier that Daniela would show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sneered, seeing the lifeless expression on his face. &#34;Seriously, Caiden? Is it really that bad? What&#39;s the worst she could do? Kill you? Look at you-pale as a ghost. What a joke! When has a daughter ever humiliated her father like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hardly registered her words. Slowly, he lifted his head, his eyes drifting to the increasing crowd of irate guests, all demanding their gifts in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill of dread washed over him. His chest constricted as a heavy, sinking sensation settled in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina didn&#39;t have timne to deal with Caiden. She walked over to the ones asking for their gifts back,standing with her hands on her hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright! Anyone who wants their gift back, come over here!&#34; she snapped, her voice oozing with arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The 5% shares in the robotics company had given her a sense of power, and she looked down at the group with utter disdain. &#34;But let me make one thing crystal clear-if you take your gifts back, don&#39;t even think about building any connections with our family ever again! Whether Daniela showed up or not, she&#39;s still a Harper. She&#39;s a busy woman-we get it. But here you are, causing a scene at Joyce&#39;s wedding.Do you think Daniela will forgive you for bullying her sister like this? And you still think you&#39;ll make ties with Elite Lux? Dream on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had never been particularly close to Daniela,but she had no hesitation when it came to exploiting Daniela&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke with such strong confidence that everyone was left stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing their frozen expressions, Katrina allowed a smug smirk to spread across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never missed an opportunity to press her advantage, even when it was clear she was in the wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of shame, she pressed on. &#34;You all really lack foresight. Let&#39;s forget Daniela for a moment. Let&#39;s talk about Alexander-his name holds weight in Olisvine. And today, on his wedding day you don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth giving some antique gifts? You all know how rich Daniela is. She&#39;s got just one sister-Joyce. You honestly think she&#39;d hold back from her? Daniela cares about Joyce so much, she gave her shares in her robotics company as a wedding gift. If she didn&#39;t care, would she do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shifted her focus to the man leading the group, narrowing her eyes. &#34;Daniela gave those shares because she was concerned Joyce might struggle down the road. My husband and I told her it wasn&#39;t needed, but she insisted on doing it anyway.That&#39;s how much she cares. But of course, you people have no clue. Fine, if you want your gifts back, come to me. Write down your name and your company&#39;s name. Just know this-once you take your gifts, don&#39;t ever expect another invite or any chance to work with the Harper family. We won&#39;t be dealing with you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice was unshakeable, and no one dared to make a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the group stepped forward, a hesitant smile stuck to his face. &#34;No, no, we didn&#39;t mean it like that. We came here today to meet Daniela. It&#39;s all just a misunderstanding. Nobody actually wants to take anything back. Please, calm down-there&#39;s no need to get upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out a cold snort, but she wasn&#39;t about to let it go that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intense gaze fixed on the man, and she leaned in just enough to intimidate. &#34;Weren&#39;t you the one making the most noise earlier? What&#39;s your name,and which company do you represent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man lowered his head and offered an apologetic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the group was about to retreat back to their seats, every phone in the room vibrated with a notification.</p>
