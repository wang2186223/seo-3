                <p>Cedric caught a glimpse of Nikolas&#39; face, lit up with mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you catch that?&#34; Nikolas said, unable to hide his excitement. &#34;Daniela admitted she keeps you around only because she feels guilty about your injury. She doesn&#39;t really love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes widened slightly. This notion had crossed his mind before, but to hear it confirmed by Daniela herself was still a jolt to his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas observed the shift in Cedric&#39;s demeanor,his smirk growing wider. &#34;It&#39;s clear, Cedric, that love built on guilt isn&#39;t sustainabe. You must see that,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back at Nikolas slowly, Cedric questioned,&#34;And why does this concern you? What interest do you have in my marriage? What&#39;s your angle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing softly, Nikolas responded, &#34;Why would I scheme anything? We&#39;re about to be business partners. I just don&#39;t want you tangled in feelings that aren&#39;t reciprocated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Cedrc&#39;s response was cold as he met Nikolas&#39; gaze. &#34;Absolutely.&#34; Nikolas affirmed with a nod. &#34;Think about it, isn&#39;t it somewhat cruel to cling to someone out of guilt? Daniela acts so detached, it&#39;s clear she&#39;s not invested in love. Isn&#39;t it unjust to impose such a burden on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes gleamed with mischief as he noticed the clouded expression on Cedric&#39;s face. He murmured,&#34;True love allows her the choice,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s response was a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t resist tending the fire further. &#34;Just let her go, and if she returns, she&#39;s yours. Are you brave enough to test that with Daniela, Cedric? Or does fear betray your weakness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glare from Cedric cut through the tension.&#34;Your provocations won&#39;t work on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then left Daniela&#39;s office briskly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he dismissed Nikolas&#39; insinuations as trivial,deep down,they stirred doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was troubled by the thought that he might just be a burden to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He meandered aimlessly, realizing more and more that since her return, Daniela had not really initiated any affection towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had always been him chasing after her, never the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had not been fully excluded by her, yet her heart remained closed off to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric bowed his head, consumed by a sense of rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Nikolas sent a message to Ghost.&#34;Cedric&#39;s left the Elite Lux building. Now&#39;s your chance.Take him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the message, Nikolas smiled subtly,pleased with his own manipulativeskills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, he caught Daniela&#39;s cold stare. &#34;Why the smile?&#34; she inquired sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; smile wavered. &#34;Oh,nothing really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in Daniela&#39;s eyes intensified, hinting at a deadly warning he didn&#39;t dare ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where has Cedric gone?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured vaguely towards the exterior. &#34;He just stepped outside, maybe to the washroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, Daniela dialed the building&#39;s security.&#34;Has Cedric left the building?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he exited five minutes ago. He mentioned stepping out for a smoke,&#34; the guard responded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas quickly added, &#34;He could be in the restroom,or perhaps he went for a smoke. It&#39;s quite typical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words trailed off, Daniela&#39;s expression turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Nikolas felt a chilling presence envelop him,followed by a strong force pinning him against the cold wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, his throat was tightly gripped, and his feet left the floor in the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His feet dangled helplessly as the air thinned around him,introducing him to the stark terror of suffocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to pry his eyes open amidst the shock,he was confronted by Daniela&#39;s steely, unemotional stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll regret it if anything happens to Cedric. The McCoy family will pay dearly,&#34; Daniela replied coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by pain and disbelief,Nikolas could only gaze back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, he experienced the deadly intent Ghost had once warned him about, emanating powerfully from Cealmaur&#39;s leader. Daniela then flung Nikolas down onto the couch. He hit the upholstery hard, his breaths ragged and desperate, as he grasped at the air he&#39;d nearly lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughing violently, Nikolas struggled to regain his composure and upright posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, despite his efforts to steady himself, his hands trembled uncontrollably on his knees.</p>
