                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression clouded over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she got out of the car, Daniela hadn&#39;t glanced at him even once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few months earlier, she had loved him deeply.But now, having become involved with the CEO of Elite Lux, she regarded him as if he were a mere stranger.	3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, observing Alexander&#39;s growing discontent,adjusted a loose lock of her hair and remarked,&#34;Alexander, didn&#39;t I warn you? Women like Daniela-gorgeous and manipulative-always know how to use their beauty. You doubted me before, but now you see the truth. Freshly out of her marriage, and she&#39;s wasting no time seducing the CEO of EliteLux. Utterly disgraceful.&#34; 8</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone acquired a biting jealousy towards the end,seemingly without her own realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s features turned even more somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Joyce&#39;s jaw tightened in frustration.&#34;Alexander, did you catch that? Daniela completely ignored you-acted as though you were invisible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remember how she used to pursue you relentlessly?Now, with her newfound status, she parades around,steeped in arrogance. I&#39;d bet she hasn&#39;t ev/en informed the CEO of Elite Lux about her divorce. The moment the CEO appears, I&#39;ll expose Daniela for the cunning,scheming liar she&#39;s always been!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was haunted by the humiliation from the audio and surveillance footage. Now, seeing Daniela not only escape any fallout but also cozy up to someone as influential as the CEO of Elite Lux was unbearable to her.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s fury simmered, building with each ticking second. Daniela&#39;s fortunate streak couldn&#39;t possibly last forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would let this slide. This was her time to expose Daniela&#39;s deceit, rip away her mask,and revel in her downfall. Daniela&#39;s fall would be her opportunity to rise, using it as the foundation for her own ascent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood there, his face a mask of neutrality,eyes locked on a faraway point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for an hour, Joyce could no longer bear the cold silence. She shuddered, wrapping her arms around herself and huffing warm breath into her hands for warmth. She turned to Alexander with a shiver, her voice tinged with impatience. &#34;Alexander, do you think the CEO of Elite Lux will show up? Renovating a building is no small affair. Surely he wouldn&#39;t entrust such a task to Daniela. What does she even know about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, Joyce took out her phone from her coat pocket and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected almost immediately, and her friend&#39;s voice came through, laced with surprise and disbelief. &#34;What the heck are you talking about?You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. My friend in security just confirmed the CEO of Elite Lux is in the building.Why are you still waiting out there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce caught Alexander&#39;s hand and hurried him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were halted by a vigilant security guard, but she quickly adapted, finding a hidden path through a cramped corridor used for discarding kitchen waste from the cafeteria.	1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pungent aroma of her perfume mingled with the acrid smell of rotting garbage, creating a nauseating mix that was almost overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clenched fists and gritted teeth, she muttered bitterly to Alexander, &#34;Get through the worst, and you&#39;ll outshine them all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was fiercely committed to unmasking Daniela&#39;s sly manipulations before the CEO of Elite Lux. The sting of humiliation still burned brightly in her memory-the ridicule she had faced when the audio and surveillance footage were made public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, she was set to turn the tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had sold her dignity to become Elite Lux&#39;s CEO&#39;s mistress! Joyce was ready to broadcast this scandal to all of Olisvine, cementing her place as the true heiress of the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by her vengeful plan, Joyce logged into her livestream account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator glided upwards to the top floor,she activated the live feed. Turning to the camera, she flashed a disarmingly sweet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, everyone! This is Joyce speaking. Today,something unbelievable happened-I got a call to meet up with my sister, who has been out of touch for three months. Throughout these months, the ache of missing her was unbearable for my parents and me.Despite the silence from her end,our affection for her only intensified. Now, hearing that she&#39;s back in the country, I&#39;m bursting with curiosity to find out what she&#39;s been up to. Join me on this journey as we catch up with my beloved sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce expertly angled her phone to capture the intensity of her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a clever twist, Joyce discreetly texted Katrina,nudging her to ensure Caiden ended up watching the livestream by accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced, sweet grin plastered on her face,Joyce exited the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was by the window, her eyes locked on the sprawling urban landscape below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce confidently approached, phone aloft and recording, Daniela remained her focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Lillian stepped forward, intent on intervening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela reached out, placing a reassuring hand on Lillian&#39;s arm to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced over at Daniela, who told her, &#34;Now that she&#39;s here, let&#39;s not waste the opportunity. We might as well harness her little spectacle to drum up some free publicity for my comeback and Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Lillian nodded, giving Daniela a silent thumbs-up in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce burst in, unaware of the undercurrents swirling in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her camera was already rolling as she captured the grandeur of the opulent office, her voice bubbling with excitement. &#34;Wow, look at this, everyone! Can you believe my sister? Only three months out on her own, completely cut off financially by our family, and she&#39;s already made it into one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. And here she is, being personally hosted by the manager! Isn&#39;t my sister just remarkable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone, though seemingly admiring, was heavy with sarcasm and insinuations, suggesting that Daniela might have ascended the social ladder through less-than-reputable means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Continuing her broadcast, Joyce turned her critical gaze on the manager and quipped sharply, &#34;You should watch out. Some people just can&#39;t help but lie.I&#39;d bet Daniela doesn&#39;t even have a hundred bucks in her pocket right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager took a step forward,intending to clarify the situation, but a glance from Daniela stopped him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s signal was clear to the manager-let the idiot put on their pathetic little show.</p>
