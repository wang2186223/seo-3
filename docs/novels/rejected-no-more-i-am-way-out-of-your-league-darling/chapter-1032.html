                <p>Like Carol, Daniela had a mischievous streak. She wasn&#39;t being serious-it was only a playful tease. But Nikolas, ever the naive one, took it seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, walked over to Carol, grabbed her fingers, and brought her over to Daniela. Then,without warning and right in front of Daniela, he knelt on one knee before Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol jolted slightly. She glanced sideways and spotted Hamilton standing across the room, his glare sharp with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,both flustered and frustrated, blurted, &#34;Are you crazy? That wasn&#39;t real-can&#39;t you tell? Let me go already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She attempted to drag Nikolas to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas,red-faced and irritated, refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol, I&#39;m asking you-will you be my girlfriend? I&#39;ll make sure my father agrees. I swear I&#39;ll never let you down!&#34; NVikolas yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His outburst made the members of the McCoy family stick their heads out to see what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little boy,confused, looked up and asked the adult  Josh next to him, &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen lifted the little one into his arms and chuckled.&#34;Seems like we&#39;re welcoming someone new into the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot him a murderous look for saying that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol sighed resignedly and tried to drag Nikolas up again. &#34;Look, there&#39;s a whole audience. Just get up,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas refused to budge. &#34;Just give me an answer. I&#39;ll change my father&#39;s mind. I love you. I couldn&#39;t care less about status or heritage. You&#39;re the only one l care about. If you don&#39;t say yes right now, I&#39;m not getting up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pushed Hamilton to make a move, but someone behind him gripped his arm and yanked him back,almost sending him off-balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he steadied himself, Nikolas had already gotten up. Grinning from ear to ear, he lifted her up and spun her around gleefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained seated on the swing, throwing a quick glance at Hamilton from across the yard,his scowl deeply set</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked grin crept onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was truly stubborn to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been planning to speak with Hamilton, but then she noticed Brad standing outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped in a sweeping black raincoat that trailed along the wet ground, Brad stood beneath a large tree just beyond the estate, staring straight at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric came to check the outdoors, the patch.under the tree was completely vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wwrong?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a frigid smile. &#34;Brad&#39;s out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s he doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reached for the umbrella next to the entrance.&#34;Let&#39;s go find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, they opened the umbrella and walked out into the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton made his way into the yard, he saw two figures disappearing into the rainfall, but assuming they were just the McCoy family members, he paid no mind and continued on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arrived at the tree. Rain battered down in sheets, and the wind roared, sending the old tree&#39;s branches shivering violently</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad bore a deep, twisted scar running from the top of his face to his chin, the uneven skin making it look even more grotesque. &#34; can&#39;t annroach Josh. I need you to qive me a window, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Brad had strung Ethan&#39;s body outside Josh&#39;s bedroom, Josh had poured every asset he had into protecting himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d brought in a swarm of guards and even placed a three-million-dollar bounty on Brad&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, Brad became a marked man,hunted from every angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could no longer get near Josh-his life was now a nonstop game of survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of options, he had no choice but to seek Daniela&#39;s aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beneath the umbrella, raindrops hammering the surface, Daniela&#39;s demeanor had shifted completely from her earlier cheer with Carol.In an icy tone,she asked, &#34;And why would I bother helping you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s expression darkened, his eyes glinting with a quiet threat. &#34;Don&#39;t you want Josh dead? We&#39;re after the same guy. You know what they say-an enemy&#39;s enemy is a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a laugh that vanished in the wind and rain. &#34;Seems you&#39;ve got it twisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad went stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Whether it&#39;s your corpse or Josh&#39;s,it&#39;s all the same-another McCoy erased, and l couldn&#39;t care less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad fixated on Daniela&#39;s piercing expression. Daniela didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Every last one of you had a hand in my mother&#39;s death. It doesn&#39;t matter who falls first,because I&#39;ll personally see to it that the last one standing goes down by my hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s pupils widened, the chill in his chest spreading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were like steel-final and irrefutable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to argue, to point out flaws in what she said, but after a long silence, he had no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Brad lowered his head in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was razor-sharp as she arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then-I&#39;m pleading with you! Let me take care of Josh. And you don&#39;t need to get your hands dirty by killing me. I&#39;ll surrender myself! I know I took your mother from you. I&#39;llserve my sentence in full. Just grant me one request!&#34; Brad cried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Daniela, that was the proper way to ask someone for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an unreadable expression, she answered, &#34;I&#39;m listening. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
