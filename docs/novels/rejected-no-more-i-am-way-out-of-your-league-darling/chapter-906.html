                <p>Regret gnawed at Nikolas. If he&#39;d known how things would turn out, he never would have dragged Carol into this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol adored Daniela, treating her as if they were family. She&#39;d always go the extra mile for Daniela without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With urgency in his voice, Nikolas called out, &#34;Carol,come with me. Let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol met his gaze and let a sly smile cross her lips.&#34;You&#39;re not leaving? I&#39;m warning you-you might not be able to handle what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clung to her hand, desperation showing.&#34;Don&#39;t do this, Carol.Stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Carol slipped free, fixing her attention on Mason.&#34;If he wants to stick around, that&#39;s on him.&#34; Mason&#39;s eyes lit up, excitement practically radiating from him. &#34;Oh, this is going to be wild. Let&#39;s give Nikolas a taste of what real indulgence looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful laugh escaped Carol. &#34;Indulgence, huh? I&#39;ll give you a night you won&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she strode over to Mason&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under a voice-activated command, the lights were switched off, casting the room into a shadowy,strangely intimate atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Mason said, shutting his eyes and soaking in the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a flash of something cold and sharp cut through the darkness, and Mason&#39;s eyes flew open,startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock held him in place as he gaped at Carol,completely at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an unfazed smile, Carol reached for a wet wipe and casually cleaned the blood from her blade. Well? Do you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed the stained wipe in the trash and picked up the bunch of white lilies, polacing them by Mason&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked past Nikolas, who was still frozen in disbelief, Carol spoke in a cool, steady voice. &#34;Come on. We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing had happened in a matter of moments. Yet Nikolas could hardly process any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol finally made it back home, showered and changed, she found Nikolas exactly where she&#39;d left him,lounging on the sofa and lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas...&#34; Carol reached out her hand toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; first instinct was to lean back, shrinking back from her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s hand hung in the air, awkward and uncertain,before she quietly pulled it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her then-Nikolas was afraid of her. All color had drained from his face. He stood abruptly, voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Sorry. I need to be alone.&#34; Without waiting for a response, he retreated to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scenes from the hospital played over and over in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he tried to steady himself, his hands refused to stop shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did Carol lose her cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a single, precise movement, she&#39;d cut off Mason&#39;s manhood, even pausing to wipe te blade clean once she finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face showed not the slightest trace of fear or remorse. She set the white lilies beside Mason&#39;s twisted, pain-stricken face with a kind of eerie calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason looked even more pale than the flowers at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Carol, as if nothing extraordinary had happened, simply said, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like she&#39;d become immune to violence,unfazed by anything that happened around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had always known the McCoy family wielded influence on both sides of Oiscoll&#39;s law, but nothing had prepared him for such raw brutality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long after they&#39;d left the hospital behind, Mason&#39;s anguished screams still echoed in Nikolas&#39; mind,haunting him with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was undeniable-watching Carol walk out of that hospital room had left Nikolas shaken to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he hurried up the stairs, Daniela caught a glimpse of Nikolas&#39; pale face. He looked like someone who had just seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol, was it really necessary to ddo that right in front of him?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol just shrugged, toweling off her hair.&#34;He′have to face reality sooner or later. Might as well be now- when he&#39;s still got a chance to toughen up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew all too well that Carol had brought Nikolas along on purpose. &#34;So what happens next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drying her hair, Carol replied, &#34;That&#39;s for him to figure out. If he can&#39;t handle it, then he&#39;s not cut out for this life. It&#39;s better he learns the truth now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela couldn&#39;t afford tokeep weaklings by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol figured it was best for Nikolas to face reality sooner rather than be blindsided later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, noticing Nikolas&#39; bedroom door slammed shut,could only let out a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, chaos erupted at the hospital. The McCoy family had rushed in after the emergency call.Mason had already lost consciousness, soaked in blood,with a trail of it streaked across the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury blazed in Josh&#39;s eyes. &#34;Hamilton! So this is your version of a peaceful solution? Forget it! I swear, I&#39;ll see Daniela and Cedric dead for this!&#34; Josh was beyond reasoning now, every last shred of self-control was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Josh issued a direct order right in front of Hamilton, rallying over a hundred assassins. &#34;Tonight, I wvant Daniela, Cedric, and Carol wiped off the map. They&#39;ll pay for what they did to my son!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot Hamilton a dangerous glare. &#34;If you care about Nikolas and Damon, you&#39;d better call them home now. If they wind up in the crossfire, that&#39;s on you,not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his jaw in silent frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had spiraled into utter chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that Daniela&#39;s subordinates would be just as ruthless as she was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Mason had crossed the line with his crude words. But did it really warrant this kind of bloodshed? It wasn&#39;t as if anyone had lost a limb over Hamilton called Nikolas. &#34;Take Damon and Cedric and get out. I&#39;ll arrange for someone to pick you up.Your uncle is out for blood, and nothing&#39;s going to calm him down except revenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas slumped onto the bed, mind spinning. &#34;And what about Daniela? And Carol? What&#39;s going to happen to them?&#34;</p>
