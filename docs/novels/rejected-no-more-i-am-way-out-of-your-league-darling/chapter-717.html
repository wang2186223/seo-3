                <p>Richard&#39;s words clung to Alexander&#39;s thoughts like a haunting refrain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, he turned and marched out with purpose in hisstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard called after him, raising his voice. &#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to talk to Daniela!&#34; Alexander replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scoffed. &#34;Richard, your son&#39;s a hopeless romantic. Even now, he can&#39;t seem to let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen chimed in, &#34;He&#39;s lost it. If it doesn&#39;t work, let&#39;s just work with someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles jumped in too. &#34;Exactly! He enjoys all the perks but refuses to put in the effort. I can&#39;t stand that.Swap him out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard waved a hand to calm them. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. After tonight, Alexander will finally realize there&#39;s no going back with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually, Alexander didn&#39;t need the night to figure it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the explosion, the truth hit him like a punch to the chest-he and Daniela were over. Still, he refused to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used this chance as an excuse-a reason to see Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t ready to give up. He wanted one more shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost her memories. How could he walk away when fate had hit reset?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when his car rolled up before her villa, he didn&#39;t dare to get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting behind the wheel, he burned through a dozen cgarettes, drowning in silence before making up his mind. Just as his hand reached for the door, he saw her-Daniela stepping out of the house in head-to-toe black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years, she was still breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time had barely touched her-she looked exactly as she did at eighteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood tall and slender, with luminous eyes and a face carved from elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she wasn&#39;t smiling, she wore a chill like a second skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, he knew-he still wasn&#39;t ready to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family offered him countless benefits to betray Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lost her memories, treated him with cold indifference, and hurt Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite all these, he still couldn&#39;t bring himself to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wanted to take one more shot at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed this was love, in its most stubborn form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made up his mind and flung the car door open without thinking, stepping in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniéla reached for her car door, a firm hand came down, stopping it in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night had draped the world in silence, the air still and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned and saw Alexander standing there. Her brows drew together in irritation. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disgust in Daniela&#39;s eyes hit Alexander like a slap.&#34;Do you hate me that much? You can&#39;t even stand the sight of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment carved deep into Alexander&#39;s chest. He was now a giant in the business world, the president of the commerce association, and the richest man in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Daniela still not see him for who he&#39;d become? Was Cedric really that irreplaceable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back a second longer, Alexander seized her shoulders and leaned in for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift move, Daniela flipped him over her shoulder, slamming him to the ground with a solid thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela quickly glanced toward Cedric&#39;s room. She feared the crash might have stirred him from sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised his head just in time to catch the flicker of concern in her eyes. That tiny glimpse shattered what was left of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, how can you be this cruel? Can&#39;t you see everything I&#39;ve done for you? I could have anyone I want!But I&#39;ve waited for you! Do you even realize that? I&#39;ve been holding out hope you&#39;d come back to me. Why do you keep tearing me apart? Don&#39;t you see how far l&#39;ve gone for you? Weren&#39;t you in love with me for years? How could there be nothing left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice rose, cracked by fury and heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him, voice chilled. &#34;Just shut up, will you?&#34;</p>
