                <p>Joyce had managed to find an influential buyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxious about potential clashes with Elite Lux, the buyer had amassed a group of over a hundred allies,who now besieged the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their objective was unmistakable: to displace the 2056 employees barricaded inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden approached the buyer with a flattering smile.&#34;Mr. Bradley, I&#39;m truly grateful you could make it. This eviction might get a bit messy, but let&#39;s keep things civil,shall we? Just make sure no one suffers any harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The media had already set up their encampment,their cameras rolling, eager to capture the drama unfolding at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux took over the headlines that day, dominating every trending topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tragic End for Elite Lux as CEO Daniela Harper Passes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elite Lux Building for Sale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Empire of Elite Lux Collapses Following CEO&#39;s Death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the media frenzy, a reporter with a solemn demeanor adjusted her microphone before speaking &#34;Not long ago, Elite Lux was a colossus in the marketplace, its CEO, Daniela Harper, hailed as the wealthiest individual on the planet. Today,just three years after her tragic exit, the company has all but evaporated, its brilliance extinguished as swiftly as it had ignited. With the sale of the Elite Lux building looming, one can&#39;t help but ponder-would Daniela have grieved over the dismantling of her life&#39;s work?Now, we turn to her father, Caiden, for his thoughts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the camera, grief washing over his features,Caiden spoke, his voice heavy with emotion.&#34;Iam Caiden Harper, Daniela&#39;s father. Everyone knew how deeply I adored my daughter. The shock of losing her so suddenly has left me shattered, struggling daily with a profound sense of loss and bouts of intense sorrow. Today, with a heart filled with sorrow and resignation, I have decided to relinquish ownership of the Elite Lux building. This decision marks my attempt to move beyond a history laden with heartache and to embark upon a rejuvenating new beginning. I solicit your blessings and plead for the support and understanding of Elite Lux&#39;s former employees, as l stand here, a father grieving over Daniela, the light of my life. I am grateful for your empathy and attention to this crucial transition. Thank you!&#34; Before the attentive len</p>

                <p>profound loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the cameras ceased roll</p>

                <p>make your offer. Once we agree on a price we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>immediately proceed to sign the contract, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>property will be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s determination to sell was palpable, as he put forth a surprisingly low price for such a coyeted piece of downtown real estate,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer was incredibly appealing to the buyer,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stirring a mix of excitement and skepticism within him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you absolutely sure she&#39;s dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face set into a mask of stern finality. &#34;Indeed,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she is gone forever. There is no doubt about it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this proposal? Could Elite Lux release a</p>

                <p>buyer suggested, his voice tinged with hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s lips tightened in annoyance. &#34;Elite Lux is on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the brink of shutting down. Issuing such a statement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>serves no purpose now. Make the payment, and I will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hand over the contract and clear out the premises  immediately. Mr. Bradley, I&#39;m offering this at an unprecedented low price. If you are hesitant, I will need to seek other buyers promptly. This is an exceptional offer. If it doesn&#39;t interest you, let&#39;s not squander our time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buyer quickly retorted, &#34;That&#39;s not what I was implying. You&#39;re aware of how daunting Daniela can be. If she&#39;s still alive and I acquire her property, I&#39;d stand no chance in the corporate arena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had a reputation for being rather formnidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seldom spoke, yet her decisive actions had driven many to the brink of financial ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just three years prior, the commerce association wielded nearly monopolistic power across the nation.Yet in front of Daniela, it was nothing.With frightening ease,she could dismantle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buyer couldn&#39;t help but tread cautiously.&#34;Are you certain she&#39;s truly dead? Trim the price a little more,and I&#39;ll ink the deal right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden inhaled sharply. &#34;Don&#39;t push your luck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shave off a bit more, and I&#39;ll settle the payment instantly. You and I both know you didn&#39;t see eye to eye with Daniela. If Cedric decides to challenge this later,it could get messy. Lower it just a tad more, and once the funds are secure, you&#39;ll have no worries, correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden scoffed, &#34;Cedric? He doesn&#39;t intimidate me in the slightest. He&#39;s incapacitated. How could he possibly challenge me? Moreover, he and Daniela had no children. So, what claim could he possibly have over Daniela&#39;s estate? He failed to safeguard his own wife and child. Does he truly have the gall to fight over her inheritance? That&#39;s absolutely ludicrous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buyer clenched his jaw, his anger palpable at Caiden&#39;s remarks. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s get the contract done now. Later, you&#39;re going to have to clear out everyone from Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s grin widened. &#34;It&#39;s a deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension peaked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Elite Lux&#39;s grand entrance, a lengthy bench had been arranged where Caiden and the buyer took their seats, encircled by a swarm of over a hundred media reporters. It resembled a massive press conference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was thoroughly impressed by Joyce&#39;s efforts.&#34;Remarkable. You managed to draw such a crowd. The Baldnia News, no less-the top name in journalism here. You&#39;ve got some serious clout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was puzzled by the turnout. She hadn&#39;t invited this many media reporters. Currently, without any real influence, she had only been able to reach out to a handful oflesser-known publications. The presence of so many media reporters was certainly not her handiwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,flashing a radiant smile, grasped a microphone and energetically announced to the assembled crowd,&#34;Everyone, I appreciate each of you joining us at today&#39;s monumental sale of the Elite Lux building.As Daniela&#39;s father and the rightful heir, I&#39;m here to transfer the ownership of the building to Mr. Bradley.I&#39;m confident that Mr. Bradley will thrive in his new venture here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had a knack for weaving charming praises into his speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His flattering words drew a light, amused chuckle from the buyer, who then reached for a pen, poised to finalizethe deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Caiden and Joyce watched with bated breath, their eyes wide with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on the verge of claiming a fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The moment the buyer signed, that immense wealth would be within their grasp,ushering in a lavish and comfortable future</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela owes me this as a provision for my twilight years,&#34; Caiden muttered to himself. The buyer gripped the pen, its tip dancing on the paper with each calculated stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to complete his signature, a sharp, frosty voice suddenly pierced the air from deep within the Elite Lux building.</p>
