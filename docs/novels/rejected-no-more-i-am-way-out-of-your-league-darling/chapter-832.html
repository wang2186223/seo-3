                <p>Cedric frowned while slipping the phone out of Daniela&#39;s pocket, not realizing how close he was getting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, catching his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his head slightly, holding the phone between them, their gazes locking at just a breath&#39;s distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space between them felt electric. So near, Daniela could even make out the tiny details on Cedric&#39;s skin.&#34;Cedric...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Cedric leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze,caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I acted on impulse,&#34; Cedric muttered, straightening up and glancing down at the phone like nothing unusual had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught the faint pink tint spreading across Cedric&#39;s ears. She couldn&#39;t help but smile softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric punched in the number from the latest message, but the call wouldn&#39;t go through. He frowned,muttering, &#34;Why send a message and then switch the phone off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Damon had been watching Daniela the whole time, caught in a swirl of feelings. When he saw Cedric&#39;s unexpected kiss, he was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Daniela and Cedric were together, Damon had never seen anything so personal between them before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss hit him like a surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there for a long time, then muttered bitterly,&#34;Cedric doesn&#39;t deserve Daniela.&#34; Nikolas stopped working on his project, considering the question.&#34;What weaknesses?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon shrugged. &#34;Not sure yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced away, cool and confident. &#34;Tell Dad she has none.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he grabbed his laptop and went off to find Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela&#39;s fingers flew over the keyboard. She was used to quietly accessing McCoy Group&#39;s secure system every day to review fies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to finalize the login, her finger hovered over the confirmation key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when she noticed Nikolas standing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up and asked, &#34;Do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hesitated before asking, &#34;Can I borrow some money from you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervousness crept in. As Hamilton&#39;s eldest son, Nikolas was not someone who usually struggled for cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet asking Daniela-a younger woman-for a loan felt awkward and a little embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had asked Cedric before, but Cedric just pointed to Daniela and said she handled all the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get why Cedric let his wife take care of the finances.How pathetic!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting across from Daniela, Nikolas felt stifled and frustrated. If he were borrowing money from Hamilton,the latter would have flat-out refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, he was determined to stand up for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, he laid out his plan, speaking clearly. &#34;I want to start a business of my own. I&#39;ve studied your successful growth strategies, and I believe this could work. But I need some startup capital. Could you help me out?&#34; He wasn&#39;t very optimistic. Years working under Hamilton had trained him to expect rejection and suppression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his father treated him harshly, so how could he expect any different from Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding up his laptop, Nikolas added, &#34;Here&#39;s my idea and the concept. If you think it won&#39;t work, then l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to say more, but Daniela cut him off, asking, &#34;How much money do you need?&#34;</p>
