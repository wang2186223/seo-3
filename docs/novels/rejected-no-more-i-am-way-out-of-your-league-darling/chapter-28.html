                <p>Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a mischievous grin creeping onto his face. &#34;Oh really? Well, in that case, I guess I&#39;ll go after Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons Alexander couldn&#39;t fully explain, his frustration-already bubbling just below the surface -flared up at Keith&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela glided off the stage,lifting the hem of her gown with effortless elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped forward and handed her a bouquet of flowers. His usually stiff demeanor softened, and a faint, almost proud smile tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Daniela said with a polite smile and accepted the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t played the cello in years, but being back on stage again stirred up the same lighthearted joy she had experienced as a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she scanned the crowd, her eyes landed on Alexander sitting among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression changed in an instant, as if she&#39;d just spotted an irritating fly buzzing around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander immediately caught her glance and, almost without thinking, straightened up, his chest expanding a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela&#39;s eyes barely lingered on him,passing over him with an icy indifference, as if he were just another face in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips tightened into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she&#39;d become a CEO and now thought she was above him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the event came to an end,Daniela stayed behind to chat with the maestros. Meanwhile, the audience began to trickle out of the hall, but many couldn&#39;t help casting lingering glances her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith gave Alexander&#39;s arm a nudge. &#34;So, are you going to go say hi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stole a glance at Daniela. She stood with graceful composure, her floor-length gown flowing elegantly, the pearls in her earrings catching the light and shimmering faintly. She appeared breathtaking,drawing everyone&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith chuckled when he saw Alexander pause. &#34;I see what&#39;s going on. You&#39;re too proud to make the first move. Back in the day, it was always Daniela running after you, and now you don&#39;t know what to do,huh?Plus, with so many people around, maybe she didn&#39;t even catch sight of you. Otherwise,she would come to you. Everyone knows that she only has eyes for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grin, Keith waved his hand,calling out excitedly,&#34;Daniela! Over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she heard her name, Daniela turned her head towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith flashed a big smile and pointed at Alexander.&#34;Daniela, look who&#39;s here-Alexander came to support you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith&#39;s message was clear-if Alexander wasn&#39;t going to approach Daniela, then she could come to him instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to their surprise, Daniela simply cast them a cold,detached look. Then, she turned back to the person she had been chatting with and resumed her conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith opened his mouth to speak again, but before he could, a man stepped in front of Daniela,blocking his view. It was Cedric. His face was stern, and the warning in his eyes made Keith pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith blinked, hesitated, and muttered, &#34;Okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela finished talking with the maestros and left the concert hal, it was already late into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t anticipated findng Keith and Alexander hanging around by the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As lively as ever, Keith quickly called out, &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up briefly, and Keith and Alexander started heading towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even approach, Keith was already grinning, his voice overflowing with praise. &#34;Daniela,you were incredible tonight! I had no idea you hadthis kind of skill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was brief and polite, but it didn&#39;t reach her eyes. It was obvious she wasn&#39;t interested in chatting. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she said flatly, then turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she was about to walk off, Keith quickly added, &#34;By the way, Alexander watched your performance too. He thought it was amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Daniela stopped in her tracks. Slowly, she turned her head, and her eyes locked onto Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, noticing this, quickly lowered his gaze. He couldn&#39;t help but think that Daniela still had feelings for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela said, &#34;Mr. Bennett, you were unusually attentive tonight. That&#39;s a first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she emphasized &#34;that&#39;s a first&#34; was laced with obvious sarcasm, leaving no doubt about her meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment felt charged. Her words were a sharp reminder of the fire incident from their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith stood frozen, his eyes locked on Daniela as if he were seeing her in an entirely new light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t like the one he remembered. She was sharp, composed, like she had become smarter.</p>
