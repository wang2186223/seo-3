                <p>That evening, Josh positioned marksmen throughout the perimeter of his residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instructed them to open fire instantly should Brad appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Brad never showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that point forward, Josh remained tense,his gaze flickering constantly whenever he exited the villa,dreading that Brad might spring from a hidden corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Ethan and Brad were absent, Daniela&#39;s villa became notably more serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other than Hamilton, who dropped by now and then,Cedric began enforcing strict access regulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave the housekeeper time off, choosing to personally prepare wholesome dishes for Daniela ahead of her expected delivery date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton swung by the property. &#34;I just don&#39;t get it.The nutritionists | hired are professionals, yet you deny them entry and insist on handling everything solo. Are you even familiar with dietary science?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Daniela. &#34;Also, I simply don&#39;t understand.Where does all the food Daniela eats go? Why does she still look so slim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once done griping, Hamilton wandered to the supply room to inspect which nutritional supplements were missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he said to Cedric, &#34;The due date is approaching,and there&#39;s no infant room arranged? I stayed up sketching blueprints. Do you want to look them over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,still tending the broth for Daniela, didn&#39;t lift his gaze. &#34;We&#39;re relocating soon. After everything is finalized, we&#39;ll head back to Olisvine for the birth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric projected that everything could wrap up in a month or two. If matters moved swiftly, returning by month&#39;s end seemed possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;You&#39;re relocating?You&#39;re deserting such an important enterprise in Oiscoll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stirred spices into the soup. &#34;Nikolas is managing things here. He&#39;s capable of overseeing operations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hadn&#39;t anticipated Cedric&#39;s trust in Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s major assets stemmed from McCoy Group, and Nikolas had already been involved with many of McCoy Group&#39;s dealings, so this was familiar terrain for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No chance!&#34; Hamilton objected. &#34;My grandchildren should be delivered in Oiscoll. You can&#39;t just walk away Cedric&#39;s demeanor stayed steady. &#34;They&#39;re my children. I determine their upbringing. Additionally, I&#39;ve decided they&#39;ll bear the Harper last name, not McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s balance faltered. &#34;Naturally, a child adopts the father&#39;s name. How could they be given Daniela&#39;s surname?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered, &#34;My wife endured countless hardships conceiving. She suffered a miscarriage and was devastated. These twins are miracles, and I wish for her happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are other methods to make her happy!&#34;Hamilton nearly snapped. But faced with Cedric&#39;s resolve,he was powerless, frustrated, unable to devise a workable argument. &#34;There&#39;s no compromise. The children ought to arrive and grow up in Oiscoll.They&#39;re the McCoy line&#39;s first male heirs-they mustn&#39;t be separated from me. Also, they should inherit the McCoy surname. I&#39;ve already brainstormed several name options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered no reply. His stance unchanged,expression unreadable, his demeanor communicated plainly that this was an announcement, not a plea. His features betrayed no emotion, closing off any possibility of discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton couldn&#39;t muster a retort and went to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was already immersed in transitional preparations, swamped with piles of paperwork that  made Hamilton&#39;s vision spin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we discuss something?&#34; Hamilton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising her head, Daniela replied, &#34;I heard what you said to Cedric. He&#39;s made up his mind, and |stand behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton seemed confused. &#34;Daniela, doesn&#39;t Cedric usually follow your advice? Why not step in this time?Besides, isn&#39;t Oiscoll a good place? The McCoys are here-you&#39;d gain so many benefits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Hamilton&#39;s eyes and said something that completely deflated him. &#34;But Cedric doesn&#39;t identify as a McCoy. He never wanted to come to Oiscoll in the first place; he dislikes this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fact,plain and blunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So stark, Hamilton couldn&#39;t challenge it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,he concluded that only genuine effort from the McCoy family might shift Cedric&#39;s stance and melt his resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,Hamilton dragged every one from his branch here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was stunned by the sudden wave of arrivals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had fathered five sons-Cedric not included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them, Kohen and Damon had spouses and three daughters each.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Including Hamilton himself, over ten people filled the house in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was taken aback as well, frowning. &#34;Who let all of you inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began doubting whether the security detail at the entrance had any competence at all.</p>
