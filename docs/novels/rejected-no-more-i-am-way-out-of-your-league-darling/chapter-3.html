                <p>&#34;Alexander...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Daniela had steeled herself for Alexander&#39;s answer,it still cut deeply, like a keen-edged blade tearing through her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many decades did one get to live, only to have it mean nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had devoted ten years of her existence to loving this man, investing her soul into the relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, what she received in return was merely his staunch defense of another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, call the police!&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice erupted in the room as she frantically reached for her phone. &#34;Leave this murderer to them to handle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the chaos, only Daniela caught the subtle way Joyce squeezed Katrina&#39;s hand following her explosive declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met in a fleeting, silent exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, her resolve wavering. Joyce&#39;s voice was the epitome of consideration.&#34;Alexander, I know you care for me, but this is a matter for our family. Calling the police could lead to my sister&#39;s arrest and tarnish the Harper family&#39;s reputation. That&#39;s the last thing I desire. Perhaps it&#39;s best if we...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off, her head bowing slightly, her delicate pose belying the cunning glimmer in her gaze.&#34;Perhaps it&#39;s best if we just let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suggestion stirred Caiden and caused Alexander&#39;s brow to furrow in contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold eyes bore into Daniela as he spoke with chilling authority. &#34;We can&#39;t just let this go! Apologize now! Kneel and beg for forgiveness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the sharp agony emanating from her cracked rib,Daniela stood her ground,her spine rigid, unwilling to show any sign of defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that harrowing moment, a cruel truth crystallized in her mind: her anguish was merely amusement to someone who held no love for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already told you, I did nothing wrong! I am innocent, and I refuse to kneel or apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just finished speaking when Caiden closed the distance between them and delivered another harsh  slap to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeling from the blow, Daniela, already fragile,teetered dangerously, her form shaking like a leaf in a tempest. Before she could regain her footing, a brutal kick struck her in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resonant &#34;thud,&#34; she collapsed onto her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her kneecaps crashing against the hard floor reverberated around the room, sending a jolt of excruciating pain that surged from her knees to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She braced herself with her palms against the floor.Blood started to ooze through the bandages wrapped around her chest, turning them a stark, vivid red. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, the nurse could no longer stand to watch the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed over to aid Daniela, then turned to Alexander with a look of stern condemnation. &#34;I&#39;ve seen the reports. You&#39;re Daniela&#39;s husband, aren&#39;t you?Once you&#39;re married, you&#39;re supposed to protect each other. How can you treat her with such cruelty? She&#39;s seriously hurt, and without proper care, this injury could haunt her for the rest of her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d never accept someone so vicious as my wife.&#34;Alexander threw a frosty, scornful look at Daniela,who lay crumpled on the floor. His gaze was icy, seeingher as nothing more than a mere fleck of dust on his shoe. &#34;Daniela, today&#39;s incident cannot simply be ignored. Joyce may be forgiving, but your actions were severe, and you need to face the consequences.You will kneel here until you acknowledge your mistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then addressed Caiden.&#34;Mr. Harper,you surely see the need for this,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp nod, Caiden agreed, &#34;Absolutely,she needs to reflect deeply. I&#39;m all for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a doctor summoned the family members, and the room quickly emptied, leaving behind only Daniela and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perched haughtily on the hospital bed, Joyce looked down at Daniela, who was still kneeling, her hands quivering as she supported herself. A derisive smirk played on Joyce&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, does it even matter that you&#39;re Dad&#39;s biological child? Look at yourself, kneeling before me.I like Alexander, and if he&#39;s not mine, he sure as hell won&#39;t be yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secretly, Daniela slid her left hand into her pocket and pressed the record button on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pallid complexion was drenched with sweat,each drop trailing down her damp and strained forehead. Holding Joyce&#39;s gaze, she demanded in a steady,clear voice, &#34;So, it was you behind the fire all along,wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
