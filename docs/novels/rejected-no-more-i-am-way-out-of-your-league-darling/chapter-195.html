                <p>Caiden, seemingly offended by the term &#34;business proposition,&#34; conducted himself in a completely transactional manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a sip of his coffee, Cedric asked, &#34;How much do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face brightened at the question. Laughing lightly, he said, &#34;You&#39;re more generous than Alexander, Cedric. I&#39;m not asking for much,just this amount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a finger.11Ahundred million. That&#39;s reasonable,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t say a word, casting a calm glance at Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden tried to read Cedric&#39;s impassive expression but found no clues. Was the price too high? Uncertain, Caiden averted his eyes. &#34;If that&#39;s too much, I&#39;m open to negotiating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took another slow sip of his coffee,maintaining his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, watching Cedric&#39;s unhurried movements,pressed his lips together. &#34;How about eighty million,then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at him, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, Caiden added, &#34;Still too much? Cedric,Daniela is worth more than that, isn&#39;t she? I wouldn&#39;t be proposing this if I didn&#39;t urgently need the money.I could offer this opportunity to many others, but I&#39;m giving you the first chance because | think you&#39;re a good man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his situation grew dire, Caiden became visibly more desperate. The luxurious lifestyles of Katrina and Joyce had left him under significant financial pressure. &#34;Then my final offer is fifty million. Consider it,Cedric. Daniela is beautiful, and nothing significant occurred between her and Alexander. She&#39;s still pristine. Isn&#39;t fifty million a modest sum for someone like her? Raising Daniela wasn&#39;t easy. For what I&#39;m asking, it&#39;s a bargain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face turned colder, his displeasure evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, overly eager, didn&#39;t notice the shift in the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re suggesting this is like a payment for marriage?&#34; Cedric broke his silence, attempting to clarify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden paused momentarily, not fully grasping Cedric&#39;s subtle change indirection. He dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re reading too much into it. How could this possibly be a payment? No, this is entirely different. Marriage and business deals should not be conflated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded with a thoughtful &#34;Okay,&#34; as his expression turned serious. &#34;Let&#39;s be clear, Cedric. If you&#39;re genuinely considering a future with Daniela, fifty million won&#39;t suffice.&#34; It dawned on Caiden that he could benefit not just from Joyce but from Daniela as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excited by the prospect, Caiden engaged more intensely. &#34;You have feelings for Daniela, don&#39;t you?I&#39;ve seen how you&#39;ve always cared for her since your childhood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze slowly lifted, his face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the sunlight, Caiden&#39;s features appeared calculating and cold, his attitude opportunistic as he chuckled. &#34;You&#39;re the boy who grew up playing with Daniela in the garden, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Lillian observed Caiden lead Cedric into a cafe at an intersection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly went to inform Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Daniela set aside her phone and made her way to the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian guided her through the back,seating her at a table adjacent to Cedric and Caiden&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tables were separated by a thin partition wall,which obscured their view but allowed every word to be distinctly heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden said, &#34;you&#39;re the boy who grew up playing with Daniela in the garden,&#34; Lillian noticed an unusual reaction-Daniela, typically calm, clenched her coffee cup tightly.</p>
