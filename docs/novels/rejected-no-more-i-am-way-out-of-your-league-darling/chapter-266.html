                <p>Daniela and Cedric had already made their way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door creaked open, Daniela peeled away from Cedric&#39;s warm embrace, her attention riveted to the TV screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric exhaled deeply, and Daniela glanced at him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce walked in mid-conversation. &#34;You really need to rein in that temper of yours, Joyce.You&#39;ve gone from bride to nearly divorced. What does that tell the world about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce dismissed the mention of divorce with a casual shrug, as if it were mere pillow talk. Divorce was often a card played but seldom dealt. She figured a bit of sweet-talking could smooth things over later. Even as a twice-married woman, she knew Alexander&#39;s track record was no trophy either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive wave, Joyce ascended the stairs to retire for the night, while Katrina took the food to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden thought struck her, and she turned, casting her gaze from Daniela and Cedric to Lillian.&#34;Why aren&#39;t you sitting between Daniela and Cedricanymore? Weren&#39;t you keeping an eye on them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, her mouth busy with chips, responded with indifference, &#34;The word on the street is that Cedric prefers men. So, to me, he and Daniela might as well be besties! No need for concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pondered this and made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sound of a closing door echoed, Lillian stole a glance at the couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was sprawled across Cedric&#39;s lap, engrossed in her phone game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, shouldn&#39;t you two keep your relationship under wraps? What&#39;s all this about?&#34; Lillian chided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Aren&#39;t we practically besties now? So, a little closeness shouldn&#39;t matter.&#34; Cedric tenderly brushed a stray hair from Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Exactly, no harm in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just indulging her,&#34; Liflian muttered, half amused, half exasperated. &#34;Despite the rumors swirling around,you two seem to relish the drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Cedric, usually so guarded, strutted upstairs overtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sighed, pondering how the girls would react once they realized they&#39;d been duped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt a nagging suspicion. While dabbing on her night cream, she asked Caiden, &#34;You&#39;ve been around quite a bit lately. Noticed anything untoward between Cedric and Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rolled over, his back to Katrina, signaling his disinterest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina squinted through her hand cream application. &#34;Something just doesn&#39;t sit right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dimly lit room, Cedric drew Daniela close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at her, her eyes twinkling, he asked,′′|sit that amusing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;I&#39;ve just realized the potency of rumors. Did you hear? They said you were gay. It&#39;s just ludicrous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s laughter filled the room, Cedric&#39;s expression darkened subtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter tapered off. She scooted away, wrapping herself in a blanket, inching towards the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips pursed. &#34;I&#39;m off to shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela peeked from the blanket. &#34;Another one? Wasn&#39;t one enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a deep breath, his jaw set. &#34;Should I not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela giggled. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down, kissing her and saying, &#34;I&#39;ll deal with you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, Cedric stood up, glanced at Daniela&#39;s slightly parted lips, closed his eyes for a brief moment, and headed to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,her smnile Hngering, drifted off to sleep enveloped in the scent of Cedric lingering in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, the housekeeper told Joyce, &#34;There&#39;s a package for you on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled,Joyce approached and, upon opening the envelope, was taken aback by its contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina descended the stairs, the look on Joyce&#39;s face gave away the nature of the documents she held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; Joyce cried out, tears streaming down her face. &#34;Alexander wants to divorce me! He&#39;s serious this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wails echoed throughout the house, reaching every ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inconsolable, she sobbed, &#34;Mom, what do l do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes flicked to Caiden descending the stairs, then quickly away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Caiden wanted to intervene, the precarious state of Harper Group meant that Alexander wouldn&#39;t take him seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Daniela could sway him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela appeared, Katrina, bypassing Joyce, pleaded, &#34;Daniela, could you talk to Alexander? Couples have their disagreements, but if it drags on, it&#39;ll lead to divorce. You have a lot of sway now; could you say good words for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you out of your mind?&#34; Cedric cut in sharply before Daniela could utter a word, his expression chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, poised to interject, withdrew silently, her heart sinking slightly. It was clear that Daniela no longer required her guardianship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was caught off guard by Cedric&#39;s bluntness.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your family&#39;s drama shouldn&#39;t tangle Daniela&#39;s feet. Have you even considered the weight of what you&#39;re asking her to shoulder?&#34; Frustration knotted Katrina&#39;s brow, and she yearned to retaliate but held back, knowing Cedric was not one to challenge lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking her agitation with a strained smile, she ventured, &#34;But what if Daniela herself is open to stepping in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes then sought Daniela, who remained head bowed and declared, &#34;I listen to Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face feI, words failing her as the retort died on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, rising, felt a sharp pang of discontent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no appetite for the saccharine display that was about to unfold.</p>
