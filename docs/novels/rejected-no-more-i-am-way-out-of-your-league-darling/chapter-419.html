                <p>When Nina was kidnapped, she caught snippets of her captors calling the press. By now, her absence had stretched on so long, it was bound to have sparked whispers everywhere. If she stepped outside in her torn and ragged clothes, it wouldn&#39;t take anyone long to piece together what she&#39;d been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage was no longer an option for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll sort this out later. Let&#39;s just get you home first.&#34; Daniela carefully untied the ropes from Nina&#39;s wrists and ankles, threw a coat over her shoulders,and guided her out of the grimy warehouse that stank of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina sat in the car, shaking so hard it seemed she might fall apart, She stared blankly out of the window as she spoke on the phone with Sammy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I talkto him myself?&#34; Nina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated before handing her the phone. Nina said, &#34;Sammy, I&#39;m sorry. Maybe you should cancel the wedding tomorrow. I know I&#39;m to blame for this,and I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am. None of this is on my cousin; it&#39;s all on me. I&#39;m really sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes flicked to Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hadn&#39;t stopped shaking. The proud, spoiled girl who once walked with her head held high was utterly gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina returned the jade bracelet to the Wesker family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in front of Daniela and gave her a faint,broken smile. Gently, she removed the gold bracelet from her wrist and placed it on Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This might not mean much to you, but it holds my father&#39;s blessing to me-and now, it&#39;s my blessing to you. Daniela, you&#39;re the kindest person | know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Happiness will find you, I&#39;m sure of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing more, Nina turned and made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the bracelet now circling her wrist. Nina&#39;s blood had smeared across the gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression darkened as she turned to Lillian.&#34;Watch her closely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Nina tried to end her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the ambulance, Lillian was beside herself. &#34;stepped out for just a second, and you did this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of the canceled wedding quickly spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Nina made another attempt on her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom floor was stained with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicked, Lillian ran out to find the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after being rescued, Nina made yet another attempt that same night. .Lillian was utterly exhausted and resorted to restraining Nina to the hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela showed up, Nina sat gazing out of the window, her eyes vacant and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took one look at Nina, who appeared to have given up entirely, and ordered her restraints to be removed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian reminded her, &#34;If you untie her,she&#39;ll try to end her life again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked over and settled into the chair by Nina&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Nina&#39;s voice was a weak whisper. &#34;I don&#39;t want to live anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her face as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face stayed calm as she carefully peeled an orange. &#34;If you want to die, I&#39;m not going to stop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes shifted to Daniela. I don&#39;t have time to waste, and neither does anyone else around me. If you&#39;re set on dying, then go ahead.&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t rush and continued peeling the orange with practiced ease. &#34;The gold bracelet you went through so much to get clearly meant a lot to you.Your father cherished you so much. If he saw you throwing your life away now, do you think he&#39;d regret scraping together his savings to prepare your dowry? When my mom died suddenly, she left me with nothing. After that, my stepmother came and took everything of hers. On my wedding day, I was accused of arson and murder, divorced the same day, and turned into the city&#39;s biggest joke. Do you think your situation is worse than mine? If you really want to die, do it quickly and stop wasting everyone&#39;s time. If not, go home. Your room&#39;s still waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slipped the gold bracelet off her wrist and handed it to Nina. &#34;Think of your father&#39;s wishes and the blessings he left for you. Whether or not you honor them is entirely up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Nina one last look before walking out of the  hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she left, she set the peeled orange on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its fresh scent slowly filled the room, blending wwith the sharp smell of dlisinfectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at the orange in silence for a long time,her thoughts far away. Slowly, she gathered herself,ate the fruit, and slipped the gold bracelet onto her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wasn&#39;t afraid to die, why should she fear living?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie figured Nina would be out of it for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news had made it seem that way, didn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had tried to end her life three times, and it seemed like death was closing in on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was taken aback. &#34;You promised you wouldn&#39;t harm Nina. So why am I hearing about rats and snakes?I also heard she&#39;s been diagnosed with  schizophrenia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had heard the rumors as well. In fact, she hadn&#39;t just heard it. She had someone dig up Nina&#39;s records from the psychiatric hospital to verify the diagnosis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your sister. How could you let this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear.&#34;Mom, how many times do l have to say this? I&#39;l make it right with Nina. Do you stilI want Daniela&#39;s assets or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without a second look, Natalie grabbed her bag and headed out for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Harper family villa, Daniela was preparing for work when Nina came down. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve made up my mind. I won&#39;t involve the police. I&#39;ll handle my own revenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the door and stepped out. &#34;It&#39;s your choice.&#34;Later that day, Nina arrived at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie saw her, a sneer curled on her lips.&#34;So, the whole city is buzzing about how you spent your wedding night with another man, and now your marriage is off. They&#39;re calling you a slut. And yet,you still have the nerve to show your face here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smiled faintly. She leaned in close to Natalie&#39;s ear. &#34;Natalie, what are you so proud of? Guess what?If | tell Daniela that you were the one behind her mother&#39;s death, what do you think she&#39;ll do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face hardened in an instant. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I dare?&#34; Nina&#39;s gaze was sharp. &#34;If I&#39;m not afraid of dying, what else could possibly scare me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Natalie glared at Nina, wishing she&#39;d taken care of her once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I want? You&#39;ll find out soon enough,&#34; Nina  replied, her smile dark and full of meaning. The unsettling look made Natalie squint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina then walked straight to Daniela&#39;s office.&#34;Daniela, I know something about your mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
