                <p>&#34;Alright then.&#34; Nikolas didn&#39;t push the matter any further.Cedric had never benefited from the McCoy family,nor had he ever relied on them for anything.He&#39;d carved his own path, strong and steady,so no one expected him to carry the burden of Hamilton&#39;s twilight years. Nikolas gave a nod. &#34;Go on back. I&#39;ve got it covered here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood there, words caught in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered uncertainly, unsure whether to go up or stay put</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get moving!&#34; Nikolas barked at the secretary.&#34;Why are you just standing there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned,just about to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Hamilton&#39;s eyes flew open and he let out a dramatic cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called out hoarsely, &#34;Cedric, come ride with me.I&#39;m not feeling well. Having someone with me would ease my mind. At my age, who knows if I&#39;ll even make it out of that hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton added a few extra coughs, milking the moment for all it was worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said, &#34;Dad, don&#39;t talk like that. You won&#39;t be alone. I&#39;ll call my brothers to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a long sigh. &#34;But I&#39;d really prefer Cedric to be there with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had to fight the urge to reach over and smack Nikolas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the EMTs, clearly confused, said, &#34;Everyone aboard now. This is an ambulance, not a stage. We&#39;re blocking traffic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pointed toward the company building,about to speak, but the secretary yanked him into the ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric adjusted himself, the doors banged shut behind him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance roared to life and tore down the street</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned back with a breath of relief, the act finally dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the very next moment, he heard Cedric calling Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang on, unanswered, but Cedric&#39;s resolve didn&#39;t waver. Nikolas&#39; voice was thick with concern. &#34;Dad,are you alright? How could you just faint like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton squinted at Cedric lounging in the back.replying to Nikolas, &#34;Just a little discomfort.&#34; Before Nikolas could say another word. Hamilton&#39;s voice turned icy. &#34;Cedric, this is an ambulance Could you show a little decency and keep quiet for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced away, his attention already on the phone as it finally connected</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, love. I ended up in an ambulance. No need to worry: I&#39;m not the sick one. I&#39;ll be back before you know it. But I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t make lunch personally today. I&#39;ll have the chef prepare the meal for you. It&#39;s nothing. Everything&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll be home before you know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric ended the call,Hamilton&#39;s anger bubbled up,his blood pressure spiking. After all he had done for Cedric. the boy still refused to see him as anything but an inconvenience. His heart was a stone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was taken to the hospital</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doctor examined him,Hamilton couldn&#39;t resist bragging to the man by the window. &#34;You see? This hospital? First-rate care, unparalleled privacy-everything here is the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary,catching Hamilton&#39;s not-so-subtle cue  to showcase his riches, gave a knowing nod and swung open the bathroom door. &#34;This restroom could outsize a family lounge, and the fittings? They put even luxury home makeovers to shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gestured toward the view. &#34;See that greenery? It blankets seventy percent of the grounds.You can imagine how soothing it must be to recover here. All treatments are streamlined for your convenience, requiring no effort from you. With the finest doctors tending to you, your health is in the safest hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary launched into his pitch with fiery enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a faint nod, his tone flat. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton burst out, &#34;This is what people chase riches for! This is what real wealth looks like!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded once more, just as detached. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton itched to ask if Cedric was tempted,but the fear of exposing his own agenda held him back.He shut his eyes, tugged the blanket up to his chest, and told the doctor, &#34;I&#39;m alright now. Nikolas, Cedric,take me home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton figured Cedric was too green to grasp the  perks that came with elite healthcare. He&#39;d have to switch strategies if he wanted to crack Cedric&#39;s emotional armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to flashing riches, no one on earth did it better than him.</p>
