                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows pulled together in a tight knot. &#34;What in the world does Lone Wolf wantwith Winslow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked just as baffled. &#34;I don&#39;t know. I asked Mose, and he said it&#39;s his boss&#39;s wife who&#39;s after him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;Wait-Lone Wolf&#39;s leader has a wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol mirrored the shock in her voice. &#34;Yeah, Mose wouldn&#39;t shut up about it. I can&#39;t wrap my head around it either.Why would she want Winslow? None of it adds up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spoke calmly. &#34;No need to burn bridges. We&#39;ve worked with them before. Tell them to hand him over -we&#39;ll talk to him and send him back after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded in agreement. &#34;Exactly. They can deal with Winslow after we&#39;re through. Less mess for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out, phone in hand, ready to place the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood at the sink, rinsing a cup, when his phone vibrated on the counter. He set the clean cup aside before picking up his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose had texted, &#34;Boss, Clarinda says they need Winslow first. She promises he&#39;ll be returned once they&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;What exactly are they planning to do with him? He needs to stay breathing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose probably checked before replying, taking a short pause. &#34;They said he&#39;ll be kept alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric agreed. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol came back to Daniela. &#34;They&#39;re okay with it, but they&#39;re in a hurry. Will a week do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;A week should be enough. But why the rush for Winslow? He&#39;s got nothing left to give.What could he possibly offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped into the room, a crease in his forehead. &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Carol walked away, leaving his question hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept quiet, knowing Cedric never liked digging into her affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol came back, she asked, &#34;Should we grill him tonight or wait until tomnorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the clock-it had ticked past eleven. She gave Cedric a quick look, then leaned in and whispered to Carol, &#34;Let&#39;s do it at one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught on immediately-Daniela was waiting for Cedric to be out cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was three years ago or now, Daniela had always kept Cedric out of her messy business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Alexander rushed into the hospital, where Richard lay in the bed, too weak to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three McCoy brothers lay pale and exhausted in their beds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, are you alright?&#34; Alexander asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes fluttered shut as he fainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, with the medication flowing through their IVs, their eyes slowly fluttered open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nearly cried out in alarm. &#34;Alexander! Daniela&#39;s trying to kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face grew grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes burned red with exhaustion and hurt. &#34;I&#39;m an old man now. Maybe I made mistakes, but did she really have to be that cold? Daniela doesn&#39;t care about you or the Bennett family. And you&#39;re still planning to spare her? All we did was invite her for a simple meal, and she went and laced the food with drugs. Alexander, a woman that ruthless has no place in our family. She doesn&#39;t belong with us...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s voice quivered, his face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, his body frail, slowly opened his eyes. After a long silence, he said weakly, &#34;Alexander, she&#39;s hurt your father, and you&#39;re just standing by? All we wanted was a calm, honest conversation with Daniela. How could she be so heartless as to drug us? I just don&#39;t get it. Weren&#39;t you two close for years? How could she treat your father like this?&#34; Alexander, I feel sorry for you. Daniela doesn&#39;t care about you at all, yet you&#39;re still considering her? It&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard grabbed Alexander&#39;s sleeve, his voice thick with emotion. &#34;Alexander, are you really going to wait until I&#39;m gone? Daniela is heartless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded quickly, his tone sharp. &#34;Alexander, if you&#39;re a man, you&#39;ll defend your father&#39;s honor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his teeth in anger. He shot a furious glare at Nikolas. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, my father would&#39;ve never crossed Daniela! You knew she was dangerous, so why didn&#39;t you think twice before pushing her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen, overhearing this, couldn&#39;t hide his displeasure. He propped himself up with effort, his voice laced with frustration. &#34;Alexander, that&#39;s not fair. Your family has gained so much from us lately. You&#39;ve become the richest in the country. Don&#39;t you think you owe us something in return? We&#39;re not obligated to make you our ally. Our family&#39;s resources aren&#39;t just for you. You can&#39;t expect benefits without offering anything in return!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s voice turned icy. &#34;We can make you the wealthiest, or we could elevate someone else to that position. Do you believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the hospital room grew unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing.the escalating tension, Richard quickly intervened. &#34;Come on now! What are we doing? Let&#39;s not get worked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard turned his gaze to Alexander, his tone bitter. &#34;Alexander, whether we provoked Daniela or not,she never planned on sparing me. She doesn&#39;t care about the Bennett family. How much more are you willing to lose for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes were bloodshot, his voice trembling. &#34;Alexander, you can&#39;t keep letting your past with Daniela keep you stuck. She&#39;s long moved on, leaving you behind. Are you really going to stay where you are?&#34;</p>
