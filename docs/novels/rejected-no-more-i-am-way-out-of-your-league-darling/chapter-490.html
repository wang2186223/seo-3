                <p>Daniela attended Elite Lux&#39;s gala, dressed simply in a white T-shirt and jeans, yet she captured everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Daniela&#39;s figure is just flawless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those jeans really accentuate her shape. She&#39;s absolutely divine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? Are those jeans Elite Lux&#39;s newest release?|need a pair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep dreaming! That outfit was tailored specifically for Daniela by Elite Lux. Do you really think you can match that? Even if you managed to get one,could you wear it like she does? Those clothes could only be truly brought to life by Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With her figure, Daniela would look incredible even in a burlap bag.&#34; The crowd murmured in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the waves of admiration, Daniela approached the stage to give her speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes scanned the audience, briefly stopping when she saw Doug with Joyce at his side. A few steps behind them was Natalie. A subtle smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough talk! Enjoy the evening, everyone!&#34; With those words, Daniela stepped down from the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved away, the smile slowly left her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down, radiating an air that unmistakably warned off any strangers. A few corporate executives who had planned to approach her with a toast quickly thought better of it and backed off,intimidated by her commanding presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them pulled Lillian aside and asked, &#34;Has Ms.Harper seemed upset recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian raised an eyebrow. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely! At the auction last night, Ms. Harper  bought everything. Lillian, what&#39;s going on with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian offered a slight smile. &#34;Nothing major. She&#39;s just been busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t interested in socializing. Instead, she sipped her drink, her gaze subtly following Natalie,who was doing everything she could to get closer to Doug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce kept a close watch, making sure Natalie had no opportunity to get any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina attempted several times to distract Joyce, but Joyce consistently declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Nina, running out of strategies, gave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela a desperate look from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela picked up her glass, poured herself another drink, and headed straight over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, unaware of Daniela behind her, sensed a strong gaze on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, she saw Daniela approaching with a wine glass in hand. Instinctively, Joyce stepped back, but Daniela continued moving forward, step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug sensed the tension and asked Joyce, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Joyce could reply, Daniela poured her wine over Joyce&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, have you lost your mind?&#34; Joyce gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s mouth fell open, and she silently cheered,&#34;That was epic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blinked, a cunning smile curling the edges of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug remained frozen, his eyes locked on the captivating woman as Daniela effortlessly walked past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inhaled deeply, his eyes shone with admiration as he watched Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, what&#39;s the reason for this? I haven&#39;t done anything to upset you tonight.&#34; Joyce, now splattered with red wine, looked at her ruined white gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops! My bad. It was an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Accident? What accident ends up pouring wine all over someone&#39;s head?&#34; Joyce didn&#39;t buy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, could you please escort our guest to get changed?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was about to make more comments about the cost of her dress when Daniela added, &#34;Let&#39;s offer her Elite Lux&#39;s latest masterpiece, &#39;Rose Rendezvous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suggestion caused a stir among the attendees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;Rose Rendezvous&#34; gown was legendary, valued at over fifty million dollars. Even global A-list celebrities have been denied requests to wear it for their appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, Daniela was offering it to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, could you please tell me what I need to do to get you to &#39;accidentally&#39; spill wine on me? I&#39;d love to wear an Elite Lux dress too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was green with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on Joyce, a mix of admiration and jealousy in their gazes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was escorted upstairs to change, Joyce felt a surge of pride welling up inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug, wine glass in hand, gave Daniela a warm smile.His round face and closely set features made Daniela question how Natalie could possibly be interested in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea seemed so ridiculous it was almost painful to consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug eagerly lifted his glass to propose a toast to Daniela, who offered only a slight smile before turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug paused, momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed Daniela had intentionally sent Joyce away to speak privately with him. Perhaps she was interested in him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why did she simply walk away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela as she walked away,his eyes reflecting a sense of unmet expectation. HHe scolded Joyce in his mnind for handling the situation so poorly.When would Alexander finally intervene?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was eager to have a night with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he was lost in his thoughts, a strong scent of perfume suddenly surrounded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug frowned, ready to scold whoever was disturbing his thoughts. But as he turned, he froze,surprised to see Natalie, who somehow looked like Daniela, approaching.</p>
