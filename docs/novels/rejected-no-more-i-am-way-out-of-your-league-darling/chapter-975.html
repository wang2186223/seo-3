                <p>&#34;Mom,am I not your own flesh and blood? Can&#39;t you make even a small sacrifice for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s hand, still buried in his pocket, brushed against something hard and cold. &#34;Weren&#39;t you always saying I was your favorite? Didn&#39;t you swear you&#39;d do anything for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, but the look in his eyes shifted. A shadow passed through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria saw the change. She stepped back step by step until there was nowhere left to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t put this on me, Mom. Everyone&#39;s just looking out for themselves. You dreamed of freedom, but all you ever did was perch in a cage you picked for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the villa, Daniela had the TV on. The next. day would mark the start of the divorce trial between Victoria and Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was reading through documents when Carol burst into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, Hamilton stood beside Cedric, rinsing vegetables under the tap. Carol leaned close and whispered into Daniela&#39;s ear.A flicker of something grim crossed her face. Her brows pulled together slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked over at Cedric. &#34;What&#39;s with that look on Daniela&#39;s face? I&#39;ve never seen her like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused mid-wash, then straightened up. He wiped his hands on a cloth and stepped away without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton made a move to follow, but Brad placed a firm hand on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused and tense, Hamilton asked, &#34;Why are you stopping me? I need to know what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ve known Daniela a long time. She&#39;s never reacted like this. Something bad must&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad spoke calmly. &#34;Even if that&#39;s true, you can&#39;t fix it.Let her deal with it on her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan chimed in, nodding, &#34;We&#39;re just here to help Cedric. Let&#39;s not get in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Cedric entered the living room, Carol was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked quietly, &#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her head. The fading light settled across her face in a dull amber glow. &#34;Mason killed Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. His face stayed still as he sat down beside her, arms wrapping around her gently. &#34;People walk their own roads. You did what you could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>11</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded slowly. &#34;I know. I just keep thinking about that day she left my office. She paused at the door, looked back, and asked me to stop calling her Mrs. McCoy. She only wanted to be called Victoria again. I remembered watching her dance with my mother once. She had this presence, this strength. In that moment, she was every bit the star she used to be. And now, it&#39;s just... a shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People shape their futures through who they are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was kind, too gentle, and never built to take charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, when Daniela discovered Josh had been moving assets to cut her out entirely, she stepped in, hoping to catch Victoria before she slipped away for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Victoria collapsed under the weight of her own weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the following morning, the divorce trial ended before it could even begin. Victoria&#39;s sudden death made it unnecessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh showed up later that day, swaggering into Daniela&#39;s office with a new woman clinging to his arm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s jaw clenched. She looked ready to throw them both out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave her a brief look, Carol stepped aside but glared hard at Josh, who only grew smug and stretched out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His partner reached into her purse and pulled out a tiny bag of wedding favors. &#34;You must be Ms. Harper.Tomorrow&#39;s our big day! Josh and I are tying the knot.I brought some sweets to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the treats laid out before her. Her smile cut sharper than glass. &#34;Well, that&#39;s fast work.Just lost your wife yesterday, and here you are planning your next.&#34; Her eyes shifted to the girl. She Looked young-definitely not the woman who had raised six of Josh&#39;s children. &#34;A brand-new one, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh caught her meaning but shrugged it off. &#34;Men need variety. That&#39;s just how it is. Only foolish women expect loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers tightened slightly on the table.11|S that right? Then I hope the women around you are smart enough to keep their dreams to themselves.These days, a woman needs her own bank account more than she needs a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl beside Josh faltered. Her smile slipped. Daniela noticed right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Ma&#39;am, what&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh opened his mouth, but the girl beat him to it. Her voice dropped to a gentler tone. &#34;I&#39;m Felicia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh frowned. &#34;Felicia, don&#39;t be so soft. You don&#39;t need to treat people like her with kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia gave Daniela a small smile. She said nothing else but held Daniela&#39;s gaze as she turned to leave.Just before stepping out, she mouthed, &#34;We&#39;ll meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were gone, Carol leaned in. &#34;What&#39;s her deal? What does Felicia even mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;She&#39;s a smart one.&#34;</p>
