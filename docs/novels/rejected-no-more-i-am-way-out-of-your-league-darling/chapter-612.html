                <p>What Carol chose to withhold was that-while Daniela lay in a coma for three years, turmoil spread among Elite Lux&#39;s executives. Believing she would never regain consciousness, they seized the opportunity to claim a substantial share of the company&#39;s resources.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outwardly, Elite Lux still projected an image of success. But those within the company knew the truth -without Daniela, Elite Lux was merely an empty shell. It stood like a skyscraper with crumbling foundations, one tremor away from collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol kept her concerns to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life was unpredictable. After three years of separation,there was no guarantee that Cedric&#39;s love for Daniela had remained the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Cedric see this as a chance to exploit Elite Lux&#39;s downfall?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, in business, profit usually outweighed sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thee was no room for further losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, Carol wasn&#39;t sure where Daniela&#39;s heart stood. In Daniela&#39;s mind, she had only just divorced Alexander, and traces of emotion for him still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Alexander stand a chance at rekindling the past?Carol wasn&#39;t sure, though she silently wished against it.Affairs of the heart were anything but predictable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all for now,&#34; Carol said to Cedric with polite finality. &#34;Daniela has a follow-up exam this afternoon.We should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked away with Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before stepping into the car, Daniela hesitated and glanced back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the endless stretch of flowers, her gaze sought out Cedric from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t explain it, but something about seeing her old classmate stirred a feeling of familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,his eyes held a sorrow so deep, it unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange ache settled in Daniela&#39;s chest, as if an invisible hand was closing around her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sensation left her breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, let&#39;s go,&#34; Carol urged, noticing her sudden pallor. Daniela nodded faintly and stepped into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car drove off, vanishing into the endless field of blooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with excitement, Alexander grabbed his phone and called his secretary. &#34;Drive to the flower field!&#34; This time, he wouldn&#39;t let Daniela slip away-he would fix the mistakes of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained motionless, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just now.., Daniela&#39;s gaze felt so unfamiliar,as if their love had never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if the deep affection they once shared had been completely erased over the past three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain was sharp, but beneath it, a strange relief settled in Cedric&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only those who have endured deep loss realize that love isn&#39;t everything. What truly matters is knowing the one you cherish is alive, breathing, and thriving beneath the same sky. That, in itself, is a blessing from fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of everything,he just wanted Daniela to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fleeting smile was all the reassurance he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shoved his hands into his pockets, smirking.&#34;Cedric,this time,I&#39;ll compete with you fair and square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t the same man from three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he sat at the top-president of the commerce association, commanding unmatched influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the looks, the wealth, and the power, while Cedric...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze swept over Cedric before he chuckled mockingly. His laugh dripped with ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, I&#39;d know when to quit. Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux, and I&#39;m the wealthiest man in the country. But you? You&#39;ve been out of Phillips Group for three years, and your name has vanished from the national wealth rankings, hasn&#39;t it? And let&#39;s be honest,your leg isn&#39;t going to heal, is it? How do you plan to stand by Daniela at high-profile events? Being with you would only bring her shame.Honestly,someone in your state has no place in the public eye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary clenched his fists, ready to lash out,but Cedric raised a hand, stopping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, there&#39;s one thing you must not forget,&#34;Cedric said,his voice even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t fathom how Cedric, given his situation, could still exude such unwavering  confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in his current state, Cedric carried an air of dominance that unsettled those around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice turnedicy. &#34;And what would thatbe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t bother to lift his gaze. &#34;Daniela is my wife. That&#39;s a legal fact. And no matter how powerful you become, that&#39;s one advantage you&#39;ll never have.&#34;</p>
