                <p>Ghost sensed a subtle smirk in Hamilton&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, should I take action against Cedric as per Nikolas&#39; instructions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded, &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost paused. &#34;How far should I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he acted, it was always with finality. He left no room for survival-only crippling or killing. There were no middle grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do your best,&#34; Hamilton replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost hesitated. &#34;What if he ends up dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killing Daniela was beyond his reach, but eliminating Cedric was well within his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was nothing more than a regular businessman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a matter of how long Daniela could protect him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the most skilled make mistakes. When the moment came, a single bullet would suffice. Hamilton replied, &#34;If he does die, it will just show he&#39;s unworthy of being the heir to the McCoy family. My eldest son needs to go through something like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost replied, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric&#39;s phone buzzed with a text from Mose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, Ghost from the MAcCoy family is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Daniela, who was lounging on the sofa, watching TV, and asked, &#34;What&#39;s he here for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose replied, &#34;Looks like he&#39;s here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s worry grew. &#34;Is he after me or my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a pivotal question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ghost came for him, he didn&#39;t mind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if it was Daniela Ghost was after, he would take immediate action to deal with Ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;He&#39;s here for you, but he seems hesitant about something. I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s just you and Daniela.Why doesn&#39;t Ghost just shoot you in the head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric surveyed his surroundings carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked onto a perfect vantage point. It was an ideal spot for a headshot, a perfect hiding place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Ghost had been in position for at least a day without making a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t make sense of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to provoke a reaction, he adjusted his posture, positioning himself more clearly in Ghost&#39;s line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice broke through the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spun around. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here for a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela patted the space beside her on the sofa. &#34;Sit here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated but eventually sat down beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he settled, Daniela resumed watching TV,her attention absorbed in the show, giving no sign she wanted to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric prepared to leave, Daniela spoke again,still facing the TV. &#34;Stay here and watch TV with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained seated, quietly watching the screen. Another text pinged in. &#34;Boss, why didn&#39;t Ghost take the shot? Is he scared? Does he know you&#39;re Lone Wolf&#39;s leader?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly typed back, &#34;He shouldn&#39;t know. 1haven&#39;t been involved with Lone Wolf in years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose questioned, &#34;So what&#39;s he waiting for? What&#39;s he afraid of? Why not just finish it already? What&#39;s his deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric bent his head, typing a response</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he raised his eyes, he found Daniela staring at him,her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you working on?&#34; Daniela asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric set his phone aside and smiled. &#34;Nothing important. I&#39;ll focus on watching TV with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew quiet once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, beneath a large tree near the villa, Nikolas stood with his arms crossed, staring at Ghost with frustration. &#34;What&#39;s the holdup? Didn&#39;t you notice the perfect chance to shoot Cedric just now? Why didn&#39;t you take the shot? Is Daniela really that intimidating?You&#39;re too scared to shoot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost narrowed his eyes. &#34;It was indeed a perfect chance for a shot, but it&#39;s strange.&#34; Nikolas was taken aback. &#34;What&#39;s so strange about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost continued, &#34;The position he was in was too perfect. The living room&#39;s over a hundred square meters,yet he somehow ended up in that exact spot.It seems...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas urged, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost replied seriously, &#34;It seems he positioned himself there on purpose to bait me into shooting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt his patience slipping. &#34;Have you been out of action for too long, or are you just deliberately stalling? Are you messing with me? I&#39;ve looked into Cedric&#39;s past. He&#39;s an orphan, raised by an old woman,and built Phillips Group from the ground up. What kind of skills could he have? You&#39;re Ghost! You&#39;ve already said Daniela is a legendary mercenary leader, which is ridiculous enough. Now you&#39;re telling me Cedric is part of Cealmaur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost locked eyes with Cedric. &#34;He&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was confused.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost continued, &#34;He&#39;s not with Cealmaur. I think he&#39;s part of Lone Wolf, and he&#39;s their leader, Zahir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, speechless and stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he broke into laughter, bent over with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the funniest thing I&#39;ve heard all year!&#34;</p>
