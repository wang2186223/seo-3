            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The entire room went silent, the air thick with anticipation as everyone waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have a clear answer.&#34; Daniela&#39;s steady voice cut through the stillness. &#34;I&#39;ve never truly understood what it means to love someone. So,I can&#39;t say if I ever loved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you treat me so well?&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes brimmed with pain, staring at her as if she were a coldhearted liar-a woman who had played with his feelings just to leave him broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a quiet sigh. There wasn&#39;t a trace of guilt or remorse in her expression, only a calm sense of finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure if what I felt for you was love, but the care I showed you was genuine, Back when we were kids, you treated me with kindness, so it was only natural for me to want to give that back. I also believed that marriage wasn&#39;t built on fleeting emotions like passion-it needed effort, dedication,and commitment. Passionate love fades fast. By marrying you, I thought I was proving my sincerity and my desire to create a life together. But it hasn&#39;t been that long since we divorced. Do I really need to remind you why it ended?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone remained steady and calm,each word chosen with care. &#34;You had an affair with Joyce.You were the one who gave me an ultimatum-either kneel and apologize or walk away. Maybe I didn&#39;t know if I loved you, but I do know one thing: love means loyalty; love means taking someone&#39;s side. If I didn&#39;t love you, then you didn&#39;t love me either. And because of that, Alexander, you have no right to point fingers at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s logic was unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the reality hit everyone in the room like a cold gust of wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying it-Daniela had never really been in love with Alexander. After all, true love-wild, messy, and consuming-never lets anyone escape unscathed. Sure, Daniela might have been hurt. But without love, the pain didn&#39;t stick; it didn&#39;t carve any lasting wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she could discuss it with absolute ease,treating it like it was a trivial annoyance rather than something meaningful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t certain if she ever loved Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, anyone who had ever been in love could see that Daniela truly didn&#39;t love Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this truth was even more painfully obvious to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t put into words the ripping sensation inside him when Daniela spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze towards Daniela was icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! I can&#39;t believe you! All this time, you&#39;ve been making a fool out of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never claimed to have feelings for Joyce. He was just fed up with Daniela&#39;s unshakable composure-the kind that made it seem like nothing,no matter how big, could ever faze her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone thought Daniela loved him, but Alexander had always sensed there was something off-something he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years, he had struggled to figure out what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he&#39;d tried to provoke her jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought being around Joyce might awaken the feelings Daniela had kept locked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, even after their divorce, he was left with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, he finally realized the truth. The barrier between them wasn&#39;t something he could fix. It was her heart, unreachable and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he wasn&#39;t willing to let go. He opened his mouth, prepared to voice the one question that had been consuming him: If he offered to start over, would she take him back?Love or no love, he was determined to make her fall for him this time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he&#39;d do it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noticed the resolve and the storm of emotions building in Alexander&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Alexander could say a word, Cedric stepped in, his imposing figure blocking Alexander&#39;s view of Daniela completely. &#34;Haven&#39;t you said enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s head whipped towards Cedric, his jaw tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re done, then get out!&#34; Cedric added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glared at Cedric, who stood a full head taller. &#34;This is between Daniela and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small nod. &#34;If you two were still married, I might have stayed out of this. But you&#39;re not. She&#39;s not your wife anymore, Alexander. You made your choice, and it was the wrong one.&#34; The harsh lighting above threw shadows over Alexander&#39;s pale, tense features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Cedric dropped the final bomb, his voice cold and firm. &#34;Once you make your move, there&#39;s no going back. You&#39;ve lost.&#34;</p>
