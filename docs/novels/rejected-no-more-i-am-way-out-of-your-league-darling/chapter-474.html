                <p>In Daniela&#39;s presence, Cedric always wore a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our employees used to be quite intimidated by him At many gatherings, everyone seemed so reserved.Eventually,Mr.Phillips found out and chose not to attend. Today, for the first time, I&#39;ve seen such a harmonious atmosphere. It&#39;s clear he really cherishes you,&#34;Jackie added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a soft smile. &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up in front of the Harper family&#39;s villa.and Daniela stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked past Daniela, saw no one else, and laughed. &#34;It seems he&#39;s really reached his limit this time, hasn&#39;t he? Daniela, you can&#39;t really fault him.I think Cedric has shown remarkable patience. Most people would have lost their cool by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exhaled deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it should all be resolved soon. Elyse is running low on funds and becoming an outcast. She&#39;ll likely reach out to her backer soon. At most, this will drag on for another year,&#34; Lillian added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded in response, then before she went upstairs, she turned to Ryan, who was absorbed in a  video game in the living room. &#34;Don&#39;t mention anything about Cedric&#39;s family to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan gave a nod of acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, Josie was washing the vegetables.She furrowed her brow in confusion upon overhearing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s family? He only had his grandmother left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hadn&#39;t he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What secret could there be about his family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie didn&#39;t think about it further. The next day, as she was out, Cedric called to check on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s eating well but seems a bit distracted. Last night, I noticed her room light was still on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused before simply responding, &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way, yesterday I overheard her talking about your family. I&#39;m not sure what to make of it.You only have your grandmother left, haven&#39;t you?What&#39;s strange about your family?&#34; Josie asked casually while grocery shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed surprised. &#34;Are you sure you heard that right? Was it really about my family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie laughed, adding a box of ribs to her cart.&#34;Are you joking with me? I have sharp eyes and ears.Remember Leven completed a marathon.How could I have misheard? Daniela was clearly talking about your family. Oh, and I overheard her instructing Ryan not to let you find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained so quiet for a while that Josie began to wonder if he had disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Is there really something odd about your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused before saying, &#34;Keep an eye on it. If they bring up this topic again, eavesdrop and let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie gave a distracted nod and said, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and Josie went on with her shopping,dismissing the conversation as just casual talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days later,Cedric made another call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie had nearly forgotten the topic until Cedric brought it up. She then replied, &#34;They haven&#39;t brought it up again. Daniela isn&#39;t much of a talker, anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded, &#34;I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, he reached out to Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go for a drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, dressed entirely in black, from his  hoodie to his  casual pants, turned heads with his tall stature as he stepped through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached with his head lowered and sat beside Cedric. &#34;Hi, Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric placed an order for a drink for Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender slid the drink towards Ryan, smiling as he warned, &#34;Handsome, this one&#39;s strong. Don&#39;t drink it all at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lifted his glass and clinked it against Ryan&#39;s.&#34;Let&#39;s really let loose tonight.&#34;</p>
