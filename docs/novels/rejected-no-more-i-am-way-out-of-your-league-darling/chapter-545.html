                <p>Hackett was certain no man could resist beautiful women, especially ones as mesmerizing as his three daughters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary muttered, &#34;Do you think Cedric will take the bait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett snorted, a mocking laugh escaping him. &#34;I have whatever type he likes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, the secretary quickly averted her gaze,a fleeting look of fear passing through her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett gave his secretary a quick glance, grinned,and tugged her into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night dragged on,filled with the anguished sobs of the secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, the commerce association gathered once again for another meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Winstow was absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc furrowed his brow. &#34;What&#39;s happening with Winslow? We&#39;re at a turning point. Cedric just took down Bruno, and we have no idea who&#39;s next. Does Winslow really think Cedric won&#39;t go after him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey narrowed his eyes at the group, a sharp warning in his voice, &#34;Listen up, we&#39;re a team. If anyone tries to cozy up to Cedric behind our backs, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. I&#39;ll be ruthless if I find out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Huey&#39;s words, the group quickly murmured their assurances. Yet in their minds, the opposite was true.It seemed smarter to offer a token of goodwill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if they ended up as the next target, they might end up like Bruno, who could barely afford a luxury hotel these days. If not for marrying off his daughter to the head of a global corporation, his company would have crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group was deep in thought as the meeting continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting, everyone sent their gifts to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Daniela&#39;s advice to heart, Cedric accepted them all,putting the givers at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only one who didn&#39;t send a gift was Huey,and the other seven exchanged looks of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey ruled the hardware industry, from basic screws and scissors to advanced aerospace components, and his products were unparalleled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, he&#39;d ruthlessly acquired any competitors that dared to emerge, monopolizing the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only challenge to his reign had been Brylee,whose innovative hardware company shattered Huey&#39;s monopoly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee had been the only one to have succeeded in this over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey was arrogant, ranking third in the association but carrying himself like a top dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dismissed the fear that gripped the others, secretly plotting to take on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he scoffed at the idea of sending gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had set hersights on Huey next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his authority was first challenged, he was the one who suggested eliminating Brylee by any means before anyone else even thought of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day before Daniela made her move,she attended a banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, occupied with greeting international guests,mentioned he woutd be arriving late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Huey spotted Daniela and made his way towards her,holding a glass of wine. &#34;Ms. Harper,&#34; he greeted in a dismissive tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed at him with indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with the attitude?&#34; he sneered. &#34;Everyone knows you&#39;re just a puppet for Cedric. He&#39;s the one behind it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Huey a look that suggested he was an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey chuckled, leaning in closer to whisper, &#34;Being with Cedric isn&#39;t easy, huh? Let me show you a better way. If you ever choose to leave him, come to me.I promise you&#39;ll live a life of ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took in Daniela&#39;s delicate profile, then added, &#34;You look just like your mother. Maybe you could do what she wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;d be more than happy to welcome it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were laced with a suggestive undertone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly stormed over and slapped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, Huey attempted to retaliate,but Ryan kicked him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew the attention of everyone at the banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood facing Huey, her eyes cold and emotionless. She moved closer to him, bent down, and with a soft chuckle,whispered something in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Huey&#39;s face drained of color, turning pale and pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Elite Lux made their move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every one of Huey&#39;s ships bound for overseas was ambushed by pirates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleven ships, packed with valuable goods, disappeared without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After receiving the call, Huey slumped into his chair,hastily arranging to meet Cedric, only to be told Cedric was still occupied with the foreign guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey bribed the hotel staff to gain access to the surveillance footage, confirming that Cedric hadn&#39;t made any calls during the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke out along Huey&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This meant the real mastermind wasn&#39;t Cedric. It was Daniela all along!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tonight, he had insulted not just Daniela, but her late mother as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief, his mind going blank as he struggled to comprehend the situation.</p>
