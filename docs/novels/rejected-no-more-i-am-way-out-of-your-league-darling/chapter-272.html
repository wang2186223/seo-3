                <p>The next morning, Cedric stepped out of Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still early, five o&#39;clock in the mnorning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was eerily quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric made his way downstairs, he found Caiden lingering near the door to his own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated, caught off guard by the unexpected sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood still for a moment, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation, but before he could speak,Caiden broke the silence. &#34;Hey, Cedric. Got any work trips coming up? Maybe something you could send me on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave him a confused look. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s unease was evident, and he seemed desperate. &#34;I just need to escape for a while. Katrina&#39;s making me lose my mind, and a business trip is the perfect excuse. No matter what happens between you and Daniela, I&#39;m still her father, right? While you&#39;re trying to win her over, you can&#39;t forget about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face hardened as he heard those words. His contempt for Caiden deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments before, he had come downstairs fromn Daniela&#39;s room, yet Caiden didn&#39;t ask a single question,showing no concern as a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,Caiden seemed focused on exploiting the situation for his own benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone like him ever be fit to be a father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained frosty as he washed up and replied flatly, &#34;There is a trip, but it&#39;s quite far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face immediately brightened. &#34;Really? Perfect! Just send me then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered in a detached tone, &#34; I&#39;ll have my secretary check if it can be arranged.&#34; Caiden seemed thrilled. &#34;You&#39;re the boss, after all. If you tell your secretary to book me a flight, she&#39;ll get it done, won&#39;t she? Perfect! I&#39;ll go pack right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, he hurried off to prepare for the trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric went for his usual morning run and then made breakfast. By eight o&#39;clock, he made his way upstairs and knocked softly on Daniela&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he entered, he found Daniela still deep in sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold edge in Cedric&#39;s gaze softened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knelt beside the bed and lightly tapped Daniela&#39;s nose. &#34;It&#39;s eight. Time to wake up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still half-asleep, Daniela grabbed his hand, pulling it under the covers with hers. She drifted for a moment longer before finally blinking her eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had dressed and freshened up, Cedric spoke up. &#34;Caiden asked me to set up a trip for him. I told him it&#39;d be quite far, and he seemed pretty excited about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod, unfazed. &#34;Sure. Let him go then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought that adding another person to the war between her and Katrina would only make her plans more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions from the previous night had unsettled Katrina just enough for Caiden to pick up on it. Now, he was eager to make his escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That confirmed everything Daniéla had suspected from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Daniela. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to tell me what you&#39;re planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled faintly. &#34;Haven&#39;t you already figured it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t as oblivious as Joyce. He likely had his own suspicions and was just waiting for Daniela to confirm them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take care of my own vengeance,&#34; Daniela said with conviction. Cedric nodded. &#34;As long as you stay out of real danger, do what you need to do. I&#39;ve got your back. But if you push it too far and risk your safety,I&#39;ll step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, that was the one line he wouldn&#39;t cross. His priority was making sure Daniela remained safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day,Caiden boarded a private jet owned by Cedric&#39;s company, his excitement barely contained as he imagined the &#34;work trip&#34; ahead. Just before the plane took off, Cedric asked, &#34;Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden waved a hand nonchalantly. &#34;Just make sure the local branch handles my meals. I&#39;m a bit particular about what l eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric gave him a nod, turned on his heel, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned home later, Lillian, who had been waiting for him, gave him a curious glance. &#34;So, where exactly did you send him off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;It was the City of Romance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s grin widened. &#34;And now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A desert,&#34; Cedric replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the plane, the moment Caiden realized his actual destination, his face turned pale. He erupted in disbelief, &#34;A desert? Are you kidding me? I came here to enjoy life, not to mess around with sand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane had already crossed into another country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the sky, no matter how much he shouted, the plane&#39;s course couldn&#39;t be altered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina believed Caiden was away on a business trip. She thought he had buried himself in work due to financial struggles, so she had no reason to suspect anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early that morning, she returned home with a young man in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with a bright smile and dimples that added to his charm, making the whole room light up.</p>
