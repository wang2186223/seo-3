                <p>Lunch was arranged at a cozy restaurant sitting right in front of Daniela&#39;s company building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she entered, she found Richard already comfortably settled at a table, awaiting her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression softened into a courteous smile as she took her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard greeted her with a warm smile. &#34;It&#39;s been too long, hasn&#39;t it? You seem slimmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a light, familiar tone,the sort that old friends might use to reconnect after years apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had this innate ability to foster a cozy, inviting ambiance effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cut straight to the chase. &#34;So, what do you need from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interaction, though polite, retained a certain cool formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gestured to the staff, signaling that they were ready for their meal. While Daniela focused on her food, Richard kept up his affable facade, his smile never wavering. &#34;You really stand out, Daniela. Bred  from such a noble family, your elegance and decorum are beyond reproach. Compared to you, Joyce is barely even in the same league.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered no response, merely selecting a piece of sushi and continuing her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard continued, &#34;In the past, I may have been unkind to you. Please, let&#39;s put that behind us. Things have been overwhelming for me, and I know I let my frustrations slip out unfairly. I hope you can let it go,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a tender age, Daniela had been her mother&#39;s shadow at stately gatherings. While her recollections of those formative years were vague, her proficiency in managing such affairs had become second nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering him a polite smile, she responded, &#34;You&#39;ve a lot on your plate, yet you found time to invite me to lunch.I really appreciate the invitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was courteous but reserved, skillfully dodging Richard&#39;s attempt at reconciliation. His smile wavered for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to be so formal,&#34; he suggested with a semblance of warmth. &#34;After all, we are family. I&#39;ve watched you grow alongside Alexander, almost as if you were my own. There&#39;s no need for such formality between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Daniela&#39;s reluctance to engage further,Richard changed his approach once more. &#34;I know you&#39;ve been tied up, but how about joining us for dinner at our place next time? With Alexander around,it would be wonderful to reconnect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued to focus on her meal, maintaining her poised demeanor and refined movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve asked for your time today for a couple of important reasons. First off, I owe you an apology.Alexander relayed to me what he said to you earlier.I&#39;ve given him a piece of my mind-truly, it&#39;s absurd to dredge up childhood stories in business dealings. It&#39;s complete nonsense! Please, don&#39;t dwell on it. He wasn&#39;t in his right mind. I assure you, he wvill apologize to you face-to-face.I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, he added, &#34;The second matter l needed to address is this.&#34; He reached behind him and retrieved a sketchbook. For a moment, Daniela thought it was her own, but she soon realized the difference. Her own sketchbook bore an illustration of a little boy on its cover, whereas this one depicted a little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard opened the sketchbook and began turning the pages. &#34;Over the years, Alexander has never stopped thinking about you. After he gave you that first sketchbook, he crafted this one as its counterpart. See here-he&#39;s preserved it all this time.&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, her hand pausing mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully flipping through the pages, Richard stopped at the final one and pulled out a neatly folded note.On the note were the words, &#34;I want to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotions overtook Daniela. She quietly put her fork down and extended her hand to take the sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, she scrutinized the pages meticulously,her face betraying no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Richard observed her with keen interest,his face momentarily clouded by a flicker of apprehension. He had someone reconstruct the sketchbook to mirror the one Daniela once cherished,yet, devoid of any artistic insight, he remained uncertain if it perfectly captured every intricate detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Richard courteously walked Daniela to the grand entrance of the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was soft and reassuring as he remarked,&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re aware of how reserved Alexander can be. However, beneath that quiet exterior, you&#39;ve always held a special place in his heart. His dealings with Joyce are mnerely a formality-she is, after all, a Harper, and he had little choice. But the bond you and Alexander share? That&#39;s genuine,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the grand building, Daniela stood, ethereal in her bespoke white gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a faint nod, her voice tinged with a hint of sorrow as she responded, &#34;Yet, there is something real between Alexander and Joyce too. I think it&#39;s best if I step back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s lips twitched nervously before he leaned forward, his tone earnest. &#34;No, that&#39;s not the case at all! What Alexander feels for you-that&#39;s true love!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s head tilted slightly, her earrings moving gracefully. &#34;Let&#39;s not linger on this topic. It belongs to the past. Richard, I appreciate your kindness in sharing the sketchbook with me today. I must leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around without awaiting his reply and strode determinedly into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, who had appeared nervous just a heartbeat ago,now flashed a victorious smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eagerly retrieved his phone and dialed Alexander&#39;s number. &#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; he announced with glee. &#34;I&#39;m convinced Daniela still harbors feelings for you.Forget Joyce! Don&#39;t let Daniela misinterpret things any further!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In stark contrast to the grandeur of the Elite Lux, the Harper family&#39;s wealth seemed trivial, mere loose change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the call, Alexander&#39;s voice was laced with skepticism. Richard&#39;s assurances seemed overly optimistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Daniela had only shown contempt for him,consistently keeping her distance as if he were contagious-not the behavior of someone secretly smitten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Richard was practically vibrating with anticipation. He then cast an admiring glance at the majestic building, his smile broadening at the prospect of it someday falling under his control. &#34;Daniela still has feelings for you. She&#39;s only been distant because of the divorce. Now, as CEO of Elite Lux,she has her reputation to consider. But mark my words, play your cards right,and Elite Lux could be in your grasp before you know it. Let me arrange a delightful dinner.Daniela will come by, and as the wine flows, you two can reconnect and see where the night takes you.Daniela&#39;s always been a sucker for romance. Reignite that old flame, and she&#39;ll be walking down the aisle with you again in no time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander absorbed this silently, finally offering a low,noncommittal grunt of &#34;Mm.&#34; Yet, Richard detected a hint of satisfaction in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Richard hung up, his phone buzzed with an incoming call. This time, it was Katrina on the line. He promptly pressed the decline button without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela entered the elevator, finding Lillian already inside, awaiting her. &#34;You&#39;re not actually considering giving Alexander another chance, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not,&#34; Daniela responded with composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what was all that about just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merely messing around with him. They think I&#39;m the idiot, strutting around with their pathetic charades,hoping I&#39;ll fall for their garbage. I&#39;ve known that sketchbook inside out for over a decade-l spotted the discrepancies immediately. They think I&#39;m stupid enough to buy this bullshit? I&#39;ll make them regret ever trying to screw with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela admitted to her own stupidity back then-letting herself get swept up in ridiculous fairy tale fantasies about love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was never the man she had imagined him to be. Yet, he persistently resurfaced,wielding the same old manipulative tactics, aiming to exploit her once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every damn time, he tried his shameless crap, thinking she would just let him take everything and walk away unscathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such individuals were nothing more than the leeches of society. And leeches deserved nothing less than to be obliterated underfoot.</p>
