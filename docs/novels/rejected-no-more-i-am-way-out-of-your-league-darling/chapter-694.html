                <p>Nikolas was seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disbelief was evident. What sort of pair did Cedric and Daniela make?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they possess some kind of superpower, like X-ray vision, to see rightthrough his plans?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scoffed, &#34;Try bringing Alexander home, and you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he strode out, the glass door slamming shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was left standing there, boiling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the deal with these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did they feel the need to threaten him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas yelled after the departing Cedric, &#34;Go ahead, confront Daniela! She&#39;s the one who agreed to this.Take your anger out on her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice bounced off the walls of the deserted living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety gripped Alexander; he hastened to the scene before Nikolas could even reach out to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dreaded that Nikolas might have second thoughts like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he paused at the entrance of Daniela&#39;s villa,Alexander was overwhelmed by a chaos of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been ages since he last stepped foot here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching a place he once avoided now demanded significant resolve from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions swelled within him, threatening to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking across the yard, he noticed Daniela leisurely engaging with her dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his approach with formal politeness.&#34;Daniela, I am Mr. McCoy&#39;s secretary.&#34; Without diverting her attention from her pet, Daniela responded, &#34;I collaborate with him, so address me as Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disappointment washed over Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her, filled with a mix of hope and melancholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, he grappled with wanting to express his frustrations. &#34;Do you realize the lengths I&#39;ve gone to be near you? The indignities I&#39;ve faced to arrive here?Why do you ignore me? Is your pet really more captivating than a conversation with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he was bursting with questions, he struggled to vocalize them. Ultimately, he simply nodded, reassuring himself that time was on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as NNikolas was about to instruct Alexander not to bother coming, he spotted him already in the yard.&#34;What brings you here?&#34; &#34;I thought it best to be driven as your secretary. I&#39;ve brought back your laundry fromn the dry cleaners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was rooted to the spot, hesitant to face Cedric&#39;s intimidating stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Alexander strode into the house carrying the cleaned garments, and as he passed Cedric,he asked Tasha, &#34;Could you direct me to Mr. McCoy&#39;s room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, feeling the tension, was on the verge of seeking Daniela&#39;s intervention when he suddenly felt a firm grip on his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Cedric! I&#39;m a man of peace, not violence!What&#39;s this about? I&#39;m your brother! Cedric!Daniela...Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shout echoed through the surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, help me out here!&#34; Nikolas yelled across the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the villa, Alexander was struck by a wave of nostalgia. The place hadn&#39;t changed much over He vividly recalled the evening he had proposed.Daniela had been standing at the base of the staircase, her eyes glinting with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze had caught her flowing hair, accentuating her elegant movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That memory had lingered with him all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Daniela, he took a seat beside her,echoing the familiarity of years past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, however, their roles were reversed, and he was the one seeking favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m merely Mr. McCoy&#39;s secretary now.Does Cedric think I&#39;m too much of a threat?&#34;Alexander extended his hand towards Daniela&#39;s dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dog responded with a warning growl, prompting Daniela to soothe it with a gentle touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, as long as I&#39;m here, it&#39;s inevitable we&#39;ll cross paths. I believe there&#39;s no reason for us to behave like strangers. Or perhaps Cedric fears I might take his position if I&#39;m too close to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric finished disciplining Nikolas and started back, Alexander rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered Cedric a friendly smile. &#34;Surely, you&#39;re not that insecure, are you? I&#39;m simply fulfilling my duties.And should I ever decide to court Daniela, I assure you, it would only be on my own time. How about we keep it a fair contest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s fists tightened; his anger was evident. Just as he was about to respond, a derisive snort interrupted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s attention shifted to the source of the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up with her dog in arms, Daniela fixed Alexander with a scornful look. &#34;Are you attempting to manipulate someone with your reverse psychology?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had anticipated many possible reactions from Cedric but did not foresee Daniela, even with her memory issues, defending Cedric so vehemently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration gnawed at him, yet he understood that showing anger would only alienate Daniela further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opted for a calm approach and explained to Daniela, &#34;I apologize if it came across wrongly.I was merely speaking about my professional role. Since we are both part of the Olisvine business community,we&#39;ll inevitably meet again. Surely we shouldn&#39;t avoid each other indefinitely,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander then offered Cedric a conciliatory smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thought to challenge Cedric&#39;s pride by saying, &#34;A true gentleman wouldn&#39;t be so trivial,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after thinking it over, he restrained himself and said with a smile, &#34;You understand my point, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas, nursing his bruised face,approached Daniela. &#34;Give me half a month. If you still find the arrangement unacceptable, I&#39;ll dismiss him,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, weary of the drama, was about to reply when Daniela interjected coldly, &#34;Tasha, prepare Nikolas&#39;belongings for his immediate departure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha responded promptly, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Nikolas and Alexander stood there, taken aback.</p>
