                <p>Hamilton&#39;s nerves hadn&#39;t settled by the time Jules turned up unannounced at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a gleeful expression, he moved with purpose, clearly looking for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;Why are you here? No one invited you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules raised a finger close to Hamilton&#39;s nose. &#34;This is Daniela&#39;s villa. I&#39;m here to speak with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton studied him with suspicion. Since when was Jules so close to Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s something you need to say, tell me instead.&#34; Hamilton stood firm, blocking entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules let out a laugh, pulled out his phone, and began dialing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the tone rang, he glanced at Hamilton and sneered, &#34;I don&#39;t waste breath on people like y/ou.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Daniela? I&#39;m downstairs, but Hamilton wouldn&#39;t let me in.Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules shoved the phone into Hamilton&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice crackled through the line. &#34;Let Jules in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the call disconnected, Hamilton shot him a death stare while Jules marched past, heading up into Daniela&#39;s study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Brad stepped in from outside, pointing at the exotic vehicle parked near the gate. &#34;Hamilton, did you spot that ride? It&#39;s Jules&#39;! Didn&#39;t he go bankrupt after that mess with Josh? How on earth did he suddenly get so rich? Do you know what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan walked in behind, nodding. &#34;Forget the car-did you check out what he&#39;s wearing? That&#39;s limited-edition, worth millions, and his kicks are well over ten million. Did he rob a vault?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes stayed fixed upstairs. &#34;You missed the pendant around his neck. The auction house listed it yesterday for over six billion dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan were dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is Jules doing now? He was broke not long ago,&#34; Brad muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan replied, &#34;Something&#39;s not adding up with this whole deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton said flatly, &#34;He&#39;s upstairs. Let&#39;s go hear what&#39;s being said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other two nodded, and all three headed for the stairs, only to be stopped instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped in front of them. &#34;Daniela&#39;s in the middle of something critical. No one goes up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stretched an arm out to hold Brad and Ethan back. &#34;She&#39;s right. You both shouldn&#39;t interfere with whatever&#39;s going on up there. But I&#39;m not like you.&#34; He turned to Carol. &#34;Daniela&#39;s family to me.Why can&#39;t I listen in? They can stay back, but I&#39;m going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward but froze when Carol produced a blade from her coat, stopping him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Daniela remained seated at the center of her study as Jules entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back in her chair, Cedric standing silently nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules approached with a. grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you receive the money?&#34; Daniela asked coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules gave a nod. &#34;Yes. It&#39;s all in-Josh&#39;s fortune. Over a trillion in total. Daniela, you&#39;re a genius. I honestly admire you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela brushed off the praise. &#34;I&#39;ve already delivered what you asked for. It&#39;s time you delivered on your end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules laughed again. &#34;Naturally. No problem.&#34; Maybe her willingness earlier had fooled him into thinking shéwas easy to sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move, lowering himself slightly, feigning respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he said, &#34;You&#39;re incredibly resourceful. Things like this barely challenge you. Would it be possible to extend your help further? You see, loads of Oiscoll&#39;s citizens poured in money too. The total pot is massive,but for someone like you, it&#39;s pocket change. Why not give all of the money to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a faint scoff. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you are too greedy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; eyes gleamed with arrogance. &#34;Not really. Opportunities like this don&#39;t come twice. I need to grab what I can. Don&#39;t you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone cooled further. &#34;And if I decline?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; smugness didn&#39;t falter. &#34;You&#39;ve already made a huge investment in me. What&#39;s the harm in going just a little further?&#34;</p>
