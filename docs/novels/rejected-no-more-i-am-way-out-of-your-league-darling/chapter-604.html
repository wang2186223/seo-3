                <p>Hackett fixed his intense gaze on Alexander&#39;s countenance. &#34;Why are you disclosing this now? Haven&#39;t you always been Daniela&#39;s defender? What&#39;s changed that you&#39;re aiding me today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes drifted towards the window, watching the steady drizzle of rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to think there was plenty of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had harbored dreams that Daniela would slowly recognize his devotion, that she would see the lengths he went to reclaim her affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he was struck by a harsh realization; his efforts were fruitless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued to stride forward in her life, her bond with Cedric resonating in such perfect harmony it appeared they were crafted for a lifelong union.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained oblivious to his yearnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What more could he attempt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation clouded his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resolved that if he couldn&#39;t elevate himself to her level, he would have to drag her down to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps then, she would turn her gaze towards him, recognizing the lengths he was willing to go, daring even to risk his own life for a mere moment of her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander,however, kept these thoughts concealed from Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a frigid tone, he declared, &#34;You don&#39;t really have a choice, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s eyes met Alexander&#39;s, where he glimpsed a chilling, lethal resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, he conceded, &#34;Fine, let&#39;s hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was indeed cornered; his company teetered on the edge of financial ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned in, his voice low. &#34;Daniela is strong, yet she harbors a profound fear that has escaped all your notices. Once you grasp this fear, she&#39;s within your control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of hope flickered in Hackett&#39;s eyes. &#34;And what terrifies her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander smirked and said, &#34;She&#39;s got a fear of heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation linked back to a haunting memory-Daniela was only five when she witnessed her mother leap from a building. The horror of that moment had deeply ingrained itself in her, leaving her vehemently averse to heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the decade she spent harboring feelings for him, she had never managed to surmount this deep-seated phobia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many people never manage to break through such psychological barriers in their entire lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Hackett smacked his forehead in realization. &#34;I should have seen it comning! Remember when Huey leapt from the building? I couldn&#39;t figure out why Daniela stayed indoors the entire time. It wasn&#39;t until Cedric had safely pulled Huey back that she dashed outside, only to hurry back in once Cedric was out of danger!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded, &#34;By leveraging Daniela&#39;s vulnerability, you could tarnish Elite Lux&#39;s public image.With their sales in decline, your company will thrive, and you could even secure the presidency of the association.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Alexander&#39;s suggestion,Hackett&#39;s eyes gleamed with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;Il support you in this endeavor, but on one condition,&#34; Alexander added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, ever the shrewd businessman, narrowed his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s the condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill Cedric! I intend to be the only Cedric left. Once he&#39;s gone, Daniela will be devastated. Use that moment in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett fell silent, absorbing the gravity of the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lacking the nerve?&#34; Alexander pressed, his tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; Hackett countered.&#34;It&#39;s just that Cedric is well-guarded by highly skilled bodyguards. They could pose a significant challenge,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze drifted away, his voice cold. &#34;That sounds like your problem. All I care about is seeing Cedric gone. If not, I&#39;ll find another partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, wait! I&#39;ll figure something out.&#34;</p>
