                <p>The roar of the airplane reverberated across the heavens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sauntered over, hands tucked in his pockets, eyes tracing the ascent of the plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to unleash a snarky comment when Cedric cut him off sharply.hold my tongue if I were you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander halted, a bit taken aback. &#34;I didn&#39;t poke the bear, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was an icy warning. &#34;Push me further, and I might just lose my cool in a way you&#39;ll regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a nervous chuckle, but before he could retort, Cedric&#39;s fists descended on him like a hailstorm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, an ambulance whisked Alexander away, the doctor confirming he had fractured ribs and wouldn&#39;t be rising from his bed for a month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden observed Cedric with a newfound trepidation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, following Daniela&#39;s departure, Caiden suddenly see Cedric&#39;s true nature. It was an authority that tolerated no backtalk, a display of violence that was bone-chilling to its core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was so on edge that he even moderated his breathing; he tiptoed around his own home, ensuring his activities were silent, and even resorted to watching TV on mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harper family had never felt Daniela&#39;s absence more acutely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since Daniela isn&#39;t here, and our space here is a bit cramped, perhaps you&#39;d be more comfortable at your place?&#34; Caiden ventured cautiously, his voice tinged with the fear of provoking Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued to eat his meal, casting a steely glance that froze the room, radiating a daunting, Katrina, finding it difficult to swallow her food, hurriedly interjected, &#34;It&#39;s just that we thought you might prefer the comforts of your own home. Caiden, come sit closer. Cedric is perfectly capable of deciding for himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden retracted further into his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tasted nothing of his meal, and a palpable tension swathed the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Cedric departed, Joyce exhaled a long-held breath. &#34;Having Cedric around was like walking on thin ice.Absolutely terrifying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This same suffocating atmosphere had seeped into every corner of Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within just half a mnonth, the HR department had seen eight different organizational charts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance department was already preparing financial forecasts stretching three years into the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing department underwent a comprehensive restructuring of all market strategies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this upheaval, everyone felt they were treading on eggshells, sitting ramrod straight, dreading getting swept up in Cedric&#39;s tempest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A finance staff member pleaded with Cedric&#39;s secretary. &#34;Please, any word on when Daniela will return?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A marketing team member added, &#34;Honestly, just catching a glimpse of Mr. Phillips is enough to trigger a stress response!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An HR representative chimed in,&#34;You&#39;re telling me! I keep my eyes glued to my paperwork during meetings,terrified to make eye contact with Mr. Phillips!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The collective sigh from the staff was palpable. &#34;Daniela&#39;s prolonged business trip is stretching us thin!Please,we need a reprieve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps the universe was listening to their prayers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grueling Elite Lux project that had extended over half a month was finally wrapping up. After a conversation with Lillian,Cedric&#39;s relayed the news to his boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Phillips Group&#39;s subsequent summary meeting, the finance department concluded their presentation,all eyes on Cedric for further directives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared vacantly at the tabletop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance director held his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing and HR staff exchanged nervous glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manufacturing and production teams mirrored their anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes inevitably landed on the unlucky secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bracing himself, the secretary ventured, &#34;Mr. Phillips...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;Isn&#39;t there an auction tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed on, &#34;I recall there&#39;s a bracelet called Blue Sea Mystery up for grabs, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary confirmed, &#34;Yes. It features eight diamonds, with a starting bid of three hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Cedric&#39;s expression clouded momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed particularly averse to the number three at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric inquired further, &#34;Isn&#39;t there also a brooch adorned with sixteen sapphires?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded affirmatively. &#34;Yes, the opening bid is eight hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric breathed a sigh of relief. Altogether, securing it would cost around two billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He surveyed the astonished faces around the room, raised his hand decisively, and declared, &#34;Meeting adjourned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was visiby relieved.</p>
