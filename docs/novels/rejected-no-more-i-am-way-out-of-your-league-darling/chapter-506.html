                <p>Natalie and Elyse arrived home, but Elyse couldn&#39;t shake her agitation as she glanced at Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Natalie&#39;s insatiable greed, she could have lived a carefree life, comfortably relying on her secret agreement with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Daniela was furious and that deal was good as dead. If it still held any weight, Daniela wouldn&#39;t have given the villa to Linden instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had lost everything and gained nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret twisted in Elyse&#39;s chest as she snapped at Natalie, &#34;What do we do now? I warned you to behave yourself, but you insisted on being with Doug. Now, your reputation is in shambles, Doug is dead, and we&#39;re drowning in the aftermath. You&#39;ve ruined our future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie whipped her head around, dsbelief etched across her face, throwing Elyse a sharp glare.&#34;Mom,you were the one who taught me from a young age to do whatever it takes to get what I want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse rolled her eyes. &#34;Then what&#39;s your plan? Why not just marry Linden? A few billion is enough to live comfortably for the rest of our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression darkened with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Linden all too well, and men in general. She hadn&#39;t chosen him before, yet had openly had sex with Doug, with photos and videos circulating for all to see. And still, Linden was there, willing to marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about feeding a man&#39;s sense of superiority and soothing his resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting married was easy, but getting a divorce later would be far more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, during the marriage, any domestic violence could only be dealt with privately, within the family. Marrying Linden would be like walking straight into a lion&#39;s den.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Linden&#39;s five-year agreement was just a lie and an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wasn&#39;t naive. She had dumped Linden once. If she married him now, she knew she would onlybe getting herself into a world of cruel treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wouldn&#39;t agree to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed another way so, she went to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was her usual arrogance. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she pleaded, &#34;Daniela, please help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Elyse, who deflected blame, Natalie admitted her mistake. &#34;I wasn&#39;t thinking straight. I never expected Doug to be so weak. I didn&#39;t mean for him to die. It&#39;s my fault. Please, Daniela, help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the sky was heavy with clouds, casting a shadow over everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood by the towering floor-to-ceiling window, watching the city&#39;s bustling traffic below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed silent for a long while, lost in her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m begging you. Please give me a way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s black dress blended into the darkening sky outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at Daniela&#39;s back, crying softly, her tears slipping soundlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, we&#39;re family. Your mom adored me when she was alive. She promised me a life of luxury. You&#39;re her daughter, Daniela. Won&#39;t you honor her wishes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Natalie&#39;s face as she looked at Daniela.&#34;You wouldn&#39;t want to see me destroyed by Linden,would you? Your mom is watching over us, Daniela. She&#39;s watching you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain hammered down, relentlessly pounding against the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lightning streaked across the sky and low and menacing thunder rumbled. Natalie flinched as thunder cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she heard a mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at Daniela in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you even recall what my mom looked like?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been too young back then, and the memories were hazy and unclear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Natalie nodded anyway, forcing a smile. &#34;Of course, I remember. She was gentle. She always put family first. She never let me or my mom suffer, and you wouldn&#39;t either, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can barely remember her at all.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice reverberated through the empty office. &#34;Her image is slipping away from my memory, and I can no longer recall the exact words she said to me. Natalie, my mom vowed to protect you and your mom for a lifetime. But in the end, she couldn&#39;t even protect her daughter.During those years when I struggled under the same roof as Katrina, neither you nor your mom ever came to see me, not even once. Tell me, if my mom truly knew what happened, would she still stand by you? Elyse is my aunt, and you&#39;re my cousin. When I could barely afford a meal, where were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie bowed her head, her mind drifting back to the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lived lavishly off the shares Brylee provided, rising to become the most respected socialites in Olisvine.She studied abroad, traveled the world, and indulged in the most extravagant lifestyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re family, so why are you holding this against me? The past is behnd us. Why dwell on it? We&#39;re all doing well now, isn&#39;t that the best outcome? Besides, you have a father. If he didn&#39;t love you, that&#39;s not our fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been pampered since childhood, accustomed to getting everything she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brief moment of admitting fault quickly faded. She straightened up, her posture now radiating an air of superiority. Daniela looked at Natalie standing before her and couldn&#39;t help but laugh, finding the situation almost absurd. &#34;Then by that logic, Doug dying because you had sex with him in the elevator isn&#39;t my problem either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s different. You&#39;re my cousin and older than me, so you should take care of me.&#34; Natalie spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
