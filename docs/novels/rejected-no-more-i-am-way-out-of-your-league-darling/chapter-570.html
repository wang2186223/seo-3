                <p>Nina let out a sharp, bitter laugh. &#34;Mom, you&#39;ve admitted it yourself-I&#39;ve been the one yielding since childhood. Why should it always be me who has to compromise? Natalie and I are both your daughters,so why do you keep favoring her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse sighed, her brows knitting together. &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice. There&#39;s only one lead role in this show. If there were two, I wouldn&#39;t have to put you in this difficult spot, would I? Can&#39;t you just be a little more understanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same weary,guilt-laden tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Elyse spoke like this, Nina found herself giving in, sacrificing her own wants without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m standing my ground this time,&#34; Nina said, turning away.&#34;When Dad passed away, he asked me to listen to you, and I have done so all these years. But it seems you&#39;ve forgotten that I have dreams too. I&#39;m not handing this role over to anyone! If someone has to step back, let it be Natalie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, Nina spun on her heels and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood there, wailing after her. &#34;Are you trying to drive me to my grave, Nina? If I collapse here, your entire acting career will be ruined!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina scoffed, her gaze lifting to the sky,unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same old guilt-tripping. It had lost its sting long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not bothering to turn around, she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, unwilling to give up, dragged Natalie to see Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, could you fund another project and move Nina to that one? Let Natalie have this lead role instead,please?&#34; Nearby, Lillian rolled her eyes in exasperation. &#34;Do you think making a show is as easy as waving a magic wand? It takes serious money! If it&#39;s so simple,why don&#39;t you fund it yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse clutched Natalie&#39;s hand tightly, then dropped to her knees before Daniela. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m desperate,which is why I&#39;m begging you. You know I lack your wealth and power. I&#39;m just a helpless mother with nowhere else to turn. Please, help my daughters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric walked in from outside, his gaze landing on the two kneeling figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Ryan wants you to call him. He has something important to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod and got to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Josie. &#34;Take some fruit upstairs for Daniela. Honestly, why do people always show up here uninvited?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he dropped into the chair Daniela had just left. &#34;Alright, what ddo you want?&#34; Elyse&#39;s gaze trailed after Daniela as she disappeared upstairs, her hope momentarily deflating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela already agreed to set up a film project for Natalie.Cedric,could you help make it happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric arched a brow and glanced at Lillian. &#34;Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scoffed. &#34;NNo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned back and eyed Elyse. &#34;You heard her.It&#39;s not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left his mouth, Elyse burst into tears. &#34;Cedric, you don&#39;t understand how difficult my life has been. I have nowhere else to turn,which is why I&#39;m asking you. With your influence,securing a movie deal should be effortless. If you refuse, I&#39;ll have no choice but to keep pestering Daniela. Surely that&#39;s more troublesome, right? I swear, if you help me this once, I won&#39;t trouble Daniela ever again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, that was not true. She would at most stop bothering Daniela until these films were finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face darkened. Was she trying to threaten him? &#34;Are you looking for trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Daniela&#39;s composed nature, Cedric exuded a cold, commanding presence, his gaze perpetually lowered as if others weren&#39;t worth his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse froze at his words. &#34;What?&#34; Had she misheard him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? A wicked heart and deaf ears too?&#34; Cedric&#39;s eyes burned with anger. &#34;I asked if you were looking for trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s heart pounded under Cedric&#39;s sharp gaze.&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You went to my wife for favors. Did you ask me first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse opened her mouth, but Cedric&#39;s cold voice sliced through. &#34;What&#39;s hers is mine. Asking her is the same as asking me. And everyone knows I never take a loss.&#34;  Elyse ducked her head, forcing a smile. &#34;It&#39;s not really a loss, is it? We&#39;re family. You help us, we help you. It&#39;s mutual, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? And how exactly do you plan to help me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...it&#39;s not like you need anything, right? We&#39;d love to help, but you&#39;re rich and powerful. What could we possibly offer? Our help would just get in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a chilling chuckle. &#34;So, you think you can just keep leeching off me forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back, his eyes narrowing. &#34;Do I look like a generous man to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse pressed her lips together, uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s tone turned final. &#34;Either let Natalie settle for her supporting role or pull her out of the film entirely. I don&#39;t lack actresses. And let me make one thing clear-everything Daniela owns belongs to me.Anyone who tries to take it is signing their death warrant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse recoiled instantly. &#34;No, we wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the house, Elyse finally exhaled.Cedric&#39;s presence was suffocating-he truly terrified her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you heard him-Cedric isn&#39;t someone we can cross. And remember, I already warned Daniela about the people pulling strings behind the scenes.She let you return and got me out of the asylum-she&#39;s planning something. We need to leave, find a place where no one knows us, and start over. Okay?&#34;</p>
