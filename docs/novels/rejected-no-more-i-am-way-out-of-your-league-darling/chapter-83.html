                <p>Cedric lowered his head and checked the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian replied, &#34;Daniela said Alexander could go to hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Cedric&#39;s face lit up with a broad grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leapt to his feet, his mood visibly lifting. Marco,who had been observing him closely, caught the sudden shift. Just seconds before, Cedric had been restless. Now, he radiated a surge of determination and vitality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco raised an eyebrow, puzzled. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stretched,his joints popping satisfyingly. &#34;Time to take on the world for my princess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco couldn&#39;t help but smile at Cedric&#39;s enthusiasm,which was downright contagious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric dashed toward the construction site, Marco shouted after him, &#34;Don&#39;t forget to send me an invite to your wedding with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s laughter boomed across the bustling site,full of life and promise. &#34;Deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of the chaos, Cedric&#39;s assistant maneuvered around heaps of steel and concrete, his arms laden with documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was baffled at how Cedric seemed so much more content here, amid the disarray of the construction site, than in the tranquility of his plush office. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Elite Lux</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian collapsed onto Daniela&#39;s desk with a dramatic flair, her chin propped on her folded arms. &#34;Are you seriously going to just brush off Alexander like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up from the paperwork in her hand,one eyebrow arching in skepticism. &#34;Do you honestly think I&#39;ve lost my senses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had zero interest in rehashing old grievances with Alexander or considering the North District project as some sort of compensation for bygone favors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could he possibly do if she refused? Take legal action?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian asked, &#34;So, what about the past? The sketches and all that... Are you really ready to dismiss it all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During Daniela&#39;s previous, infatuation-laden phase,Lillian had been genuinely alarmed, dreading that Daniela might surrender the North District project to Alexander out of some residual affection. Such a decision would crush Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Lillian&#39;s relief, Daniela seemed more rational and detached than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nonchalant shrug, Daniela dismissed the concerns. &#34;Forget about it. Anyway, we&#39;ve got to visit the North District site this afternoon. I need to oversee the progress myself. It&#39;s going to be Elite Lux&#39;s flagship domestic branch, so it has to be flawless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian opened her mouth to reply when suddenly, the sharp ring of the secretary&#39;s call interrupted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Harper, two gentlemen asserting they&#39;re your uncles have arrived. One calls himself Ronald, the other Wyatt. In the brief ten minutes since their arrival, they&#39;ve managed to clear out the snack tray in the lounge. Actually, they&#39;ve shoved snacks into their pockets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed in annoyance. &#34;Inform them I&#39;m tied up in a meeting. I&#39;m unavailable today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These individuals were no different from Caiden-cut from the same cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when her mother was still alive, they had whispered harshly about her, branding her as domineering and manipulative, and they didn&#39;t hesitate to spread those tales to anyone outside the family circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her mother&#39;s death, not one of them had bothered to show up at her funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when Katrina had married into the family, they had draped over her, calling her &#34;sister-in-law&#34; with a cloying sweetness that was almost repulsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Daniela had distanced herself from these relatives and had no desire to bridge that gap now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her priorities lay elsewhere-signing more contracts and boosting the company&#39;s bottom line was far more appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela ended the call, the secretary stepped into the lounge, wearing a practiced, polite smile. &#34;I&#39;m terribly sorry, but Miss Harper is currently engaged in a meeting and will be occupied for the remainder of the day. Unfortunately, she won&#39;t be able to meet with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s brow furrowed as he turned to Wyatt, his tone laced with disbelief. &#34;Seriously? What the hell is her problem? We&#39;re her damn uncles, for crying out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>loud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt rose to his feet, his voice firm as he addressed the assistant. &#34;Pass this along to Daniela: because of her, we&#39;ve severed ties with Katrina. We&#39;re backing Daniela now. She needs to come down and see us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant kept a courteous smile plastered on her face.&#34;I&#39;ll convey your message, gentlemen, but as l mentioned earlier, Miss Harper is engaged in a meeting and really can&#39;t spare any time today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt&#39;s expression darkened and turned to Ronald.&#34;What do we do now? Are we really just going to walk out like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper,tinged with urgency. &#34;Walk out? Are you out of your mind? Katrina is no help with the jobs at Elite Lux. If we don&#39;t talk to Daniela, we&#39;re going to end up jobless and destitute! We stay right here, even if it takes all day. If she won&#39;t talk here in the lounge, we&#39;ll confront her in the parking lot. Daniela managed to secure a position for Joyce. Why the fuck can&#39;t she do the same for us? Aren&#39;t we her family too?&#34;</p>
