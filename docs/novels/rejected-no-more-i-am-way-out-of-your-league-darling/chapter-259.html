                <p>Richard had a sinking feeling that this wouldn&#39;t be good news. Without thinking, he asked, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul replied, &#34;Everyone&#39;s on the same page that the Bennettfamily made a huge mistake. How could they let go of such a talented daughter-in-law and bring back someone like Joyce instead? The word around town is to stop worrying about other investments and just follow Daniela&#39;s example. Whatever she puts money in, we should too. Just a little bit of her success would be enough to keep us comnfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s feelings became more tangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, we have a network that focuses on the elites at Elite Lux, collecting insider information. We often send gifts to find out what Daniela&#39;s involved with. Would you like to be a part of it?&#34; Raul asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was tempted, yet a sense of shame held him back. &#34;There&#39;s no need for that. This might just be a lucky break. Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself; be careful not to overstep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul laughed lightly. &#34;You sound so cynical, Richard. Fine, if you&#39;re not interested, it&#39;s your call. We don&#39;t have many spots left, anyway. The fee&#39;s now two million, and we&#39;re full.Bye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calI ended, and Richard felt even more downhearted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard of that association before, but he had no idea just how exclusive it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With over two thousand members, all scrambling to win Daniela&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What shocked him, though, was the price of entry-two million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was downright ridiculous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Richard turned to Alexander with a sudden thought and asked,&#34;Do you think we should join this association? Is there still a chance we could get involved with that robotics company? Could Joyce assist us?&#34; Alexander&#39;s expression remained icy. &#34;You&#39;re better off relying on yourself than depending on others. Don&#39;t join that association; it&#39;s beneath you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard let out a heavy sigh. It was, indeed, humiliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip going around was that Alexander had traded a priceless gem for something completely worthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had pushed away a perfectly good daughter-in-law, and now, joining her association would make him the laughingstock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what choice did he have? There was too much money on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly,Richard decided to keep pushing forward and went to seek out Joyce for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re saying you want to invest in the robotics company?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard nodded, offering a charming smile. &#34;Exactly. After all, Daniela is your sister, and your influence counts for a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sneered in response. &#34;So now you recognize my worth? Now you&#39;re flattering me? Who was it that called me useless? And now you want my help? Forget it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce never missed an opportunity to speak her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took pleasure in putting people down with her sharp words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though seething with anger, Richard swallowed his pride. &#34;We don&#39;t need much,just 5% shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was even more satisfied, looking down at Richard with contempt. &#34;Who do you think you are? Do you really believe you&#39;re worthy of this? When Alexander married me, you barely cared. When he hit me,you didn&#39;t defend me. Have you ever treated me like family? People say Alexander can&#39;t stand me. Did you ever stand up for me? And now, just because there&#39;s a benefit, you want to use me? You&#39;ve got some nerve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes went wide in shock. This wasn&#39;t the response he had hoped for. No one had ever spoken to him in such a way before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joyce kept her cold smile in place and continued, &#34;You don&#39;t see me as a person, and frankly, I don&#39;t care about you either. Now that I have money, you think you can use me to get close to Daniela?Dream on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was practically shaking with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce relished the moment more and more. &#34;I love watching you squirrn. Aren&#39;t you all so proud? And now you have to lower yourselves to me? How pathetic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s fingers quivered as he pointed at Joyce&#39;s arrogant face. &#34;Who are you calling pathetic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a sharp slap echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood still for a moment, stunned, before wiping her mouth and noticing the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, she stood tall and coldly stared up at Alexander, who was a head taller than her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually hit me? I&#39;ll make you pay for that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she charged at Alexander, but he responded by slapping her hard again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, Joyce lost all control, her fury erupting as she began smashing everything she could get her hands on in the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood off to the side, watching with a calm expression. His indifference only fueled Joyce&#39;s anger.In a fit of rage, she stormed into the kitchen and returned with a knife in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two clashed fiercely, the tension escalating with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the fight, Alexander was slashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s anger. boiled over, his body trembling with rage as he dialed the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katrina received the call, she was stunned. Alexander was planning to charge Joyce with attempted murder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed utterly ridiculous to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through Katrina as her eyes met Caiden&#39;s icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Caiden turned his gaze elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clenched her teeth as the door to the villa creaked open.</p>
