                <p>As Peyton watched the video, her expression darkened with each moment that passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, she slammed her palm against the table,rising to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jabbed a finger towards Katrina, her voice sharp as she accused her. &#34;You scheming little pest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then spun to face Caiden, her eyes ablaze with indignation. &#34;Look at the sort of people you&#39;ve let into our family. What have they turned your daughter into?On such a crucial day, they dared to behave like this and yet they lounge comfortably in our villa! You&#39;ve clearly let these two rascals get away with too much.It&#39;s no wonder Daniela felt compelled to flee from this place after enduring such torment. Caiden, you really are beyond belief!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Peyton unleashed her tirade, Katrina attempted to muster a tearful display of innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before she could begin her act, Peyton cut her off sharply, and when Katrina resorted to a dramatic threat to end her own life, Peyton coldly addressed Caiden. &#34;If she&#39;s serious, then so be it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless,my granddaughter&#39;s marriage couldn&#39;t be delayed. Fetch Alexander immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes shot open in alarm. &#34;Peyton, what are you implying? Alexander belongs to Joyce now! Why summon him here? Are you seriously implying that Daniela and Alexander should try to spark things up again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton swiveled her head back, her voice steady and resolute. &#34;And why not? Marriage should be based on mutual affection. If Alexander retains his feelings and wishes to reunite with Daniela, I see no fault in exploring that possibility!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit her like a slap, and all Katrina could think about was how satisfyingit would feel to shut Peyton up permanently. 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Caiden, her eyes brimming with tears,seeking some solace or support. Yet Caiden,absorbed in his phone and utterly detached, simply shrugged.&#34;Mom isn&#39;t wrong. Joyce was at fault back then.Haven&#39;t you always trusted the Bennett family? It wouldn&#39;t hurt to have Alexander come over and discuss things. Marriage does require agreement from both parties, after all. You wouldn&#39;t want Joyce to end up miserable, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rang with a veneer of reason and righteousness. Katrina&#39;s gaze lingered on Caiden, now riddled with doubt and suspicion. &#34;Honey...&#34; She positioned herself beside him, her tone tinged with concern. &#34;Have you been dealing with something lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden barely glanced up from his game. &#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t forgotten how you were once all for Alexander and Joyce, claiming they were perfect for each other, like it was written in the stars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been days since she heard Caiden refer to Daniela as a disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Caiden&#39;s response was nonchalant. &#34;I still believe they&#39;re suited for each other. But with Mom here now, it seems wise to go along with her wishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had never considered Caiden particularly devoted or dutiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her younger days, Peyton had been a forceful personality with little time to spare for nurturing her children. Despite outward appearances of closeness,Katrina sensed the children&#39;s affections were superficial at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was keenly aware of the emotional distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Katrina had even grown suspicious of Caiden&#39;s frequent use of his phone, fearing he might be entangled in an affair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her investigations revealed that Caiden&#39;s most significant phone expense was not clandestine meetings but online chess games. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, it was Caiden who arranged for Alexander to visit, ostensibly for Peyton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander was about to enter, Katrina clasped his hand urgently. Her expression was anything but serene as she implored, &#34;Alexander, my mother-in-law is inside. Just respond to her questions, and remember,there&#39;s no need to be nervous or speak without thinking,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling his hand gently from her grasp, Alexander responded with a measured coolness, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the absence of his hand, Katrina experienced a pang of emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his entry, Peyton greeted him with uncharacteristic warmth. &#34;Alexander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat, Alexander acknowledged her with a nod.&#34;It&#39;s good to see you, Mrs. Harper.&#34;</p>
