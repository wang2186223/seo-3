                <p>Cedric walked into the room and went straight to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol saw it and felt a chill down her spine, deciding right then to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, the living room was quiet, just the two of them left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered her a bowl of freshly rinsed strawberries. &#34;Are you afraid someone&#39;s going to push me around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over and her face tightened slightly.&#34;Did you find out the truth about your biological parents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a nod. &#34;Yeah, I did.&#34; Daniela looked at him and asked, &#34;So, how do you feel about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he asked, &#34;Do you want the McCoy family&#39;s wealth?&#34; His voice stayed easy, but there was something solid behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small smirk. His confidence was hard to ignore. &#34;You say that like it&#39;s yours already.What makes you think you can just grab it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a firm nod. &#34;If it&#39;s something you want,then I&#39;ll fight for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight in his voice made it obvious he meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head and looked to the doorway.Nikolas was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled softly. &#34;Right now, I don&#39;t care about it.But if I wake up in a bad mood one day, maybe I&#39;ll hand it over to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34; Nikolas stepped in with a sharp look just as her sentence ended. Daniela rolled her eyes without much interest. &#34;W/hy wouldn&#39;t I dare? And anyway, since when does my man need your say-so to make a move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came out smooth. She didn&#39;t notice anything strange about what she&#39;d said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at her for a moment, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she noticed his look, Daniela turned and asked, &#34;Did I say something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft laugh. &#34;No. Not at all.Whatever you say is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance crept over him, certain this couple had gone too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one thing to show off their affection. But acting like the McCoy fortune already belonged to them? That was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the worst part was, they weren&#39;t entirely wrong -and that truth made it sting even more. Nikolas pulled out his phone and called Kohen.&#34;Where are you right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s voice came through light and amused.&#34;Why the rush? I&#39;m already nearby. Just send me the exact location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas always hated that tone. Kohen treated everything like it was no big deal. &#34;How can I not be anxious? If you don&#39;t show up soon, Cedric&#39;s going to use Daniela&#39;s sway to take over everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen let out a quiet laugh. His voice stayed calm.&#34;Got it. I&#39;ll be there in about an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat quietly on the couch, eyes fixed on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol walked up and said, &#34;The police said Natalie scratched your name all over her prison wall. She might show up here, so we need to be on guard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could reply, the front door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head, thinking it was Cedric. But instead, a man stood there who looked faintly familiar, yet she couldn&#39;t place him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34; he called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand paused mid-reach for the remote. &#34;I&#39;m Kohen McCoy. Just call me Kohen. I&#39;m here for my brother,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stepped inside, arms full of items, with a secretary trailing behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured toward the table stacked with gifts.&#34;I rushed over, so I didn&#39;t get much time to prepare.I brought cosmetics for you, health stuff for Cedric,and a designer bag for Joyce. And a LEGO set for Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen wore a warm smile, like he had been welcomed here a hundred times before. &#34;I just got off a flight. Tasha, could you bring me some water? Oh,and this gift is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas came in right after, wearing a stormy expression. &#34;Wow. You even brought a gift for the servant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen kept his smile. &#34;We&#39;re family, aren&#39;t we? First visit calls for gifts. That&#39;s only proper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked as comfortable as someone who belonged there, then turned casually to Daniela. &#34;Where&#39;s Cedric? Is he still at the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at him, her face calm and unreadable.</p>
