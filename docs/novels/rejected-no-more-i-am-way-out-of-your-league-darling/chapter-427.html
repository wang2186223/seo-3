                <p>Daniela stood up, flashing a smile at Cedric. &#34;I&#39;ll be right back, just going to the restroom,&#34; she said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked past the tables, her hand shot out to grab a man, bundled up tightly in his coat, and without a second thought, she effortlessly yanked him along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned around, only to see the usual diners eating and chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pulledthe man into the restroom and, before stepping in, hung up a &#34;Under Maintenance&#34; sign on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was caught off guard at first, but once he saw Daniela standing in front of him, he seemed to calm down a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her immense power and influence, Daniela was alone at that moment. No matter what went down, it wouldn&#39;t be anything too serious. The pay for this gig was huge. Even if he lost the job, it wouldn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came alone,&#34; the man said proudly, impressed by Daniela&#39;s beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you,&#34; he said, clearly amused. &#34;I came on my own. Cedric&#39;s so famous, I just wanted to see if l could dig up any gossip or scandals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed, her gaze sharp and calculating. She asked coldly, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded, a confident grin spreading across his face. &#34;Of course. Why else would I follow Cedric?I&#39;m not a woman, so I wouldn&#39;t be after him like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, clearly uninterested in wasting time, gave a faint smile. &#34;It seems like you&#39;re not going to cooperate.&#34; The man froze, feeling an unsettling chill crawl up his spine as he caught sight of the smile on Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the man began to grow more anxious, he heard Daniela say, &#34;Fine, don&#39;t say anything then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was shocked by her sudden concession, unsure of what to make of her calm attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he hesitantly tried to step towards the door, Daniela didn&#39;t stop him. Instead, she leaned back against the doorframe, with arms crossed and a sneer of disdain curling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man flinched once more, clearly startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to leave, Daniela let out a chuckle and said slowly, &#34;Have you ever heard that saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man turned his head in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s red lips curled slightly as she spoke. &#34;You can make a fortune, but if you&#39;re dead, none of that money will matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s heart skipped a beat at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; Daniela said, her smile growing as she straightened up and began to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicked,the man shouted, &#34;Hey, what do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly what it sounds lik⟨e111Daniela replied with a smile that seemed to deepen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man&#39;s smile faded instantly, and his arrogance evaporated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear overtook him, and he stared at Daniela with wide eyes. &#34;What do you mean? You have to explain yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the restaurant hallway, Daniela smiled as a breeze swept in through the open window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression stayed calm and collected, her voice as casual as if she were commenting on the weather.&#34;Have you ever heard of Shadowpeak Madhouse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her mouth, the man felt a chill crawl up his spine, goose bumps rising on his arm. &#34;A few days ago, I sent Caiden there. I&#39;m visiting him tomorrow. The hospital says he&#39;s lonely and needs a roommate. I think you&#39;ll fit in perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s legs gave out, and he dropped to his knees with a heavy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadowpeak Madhouse was infamous for housing the most violent and vengeful patients. It was rumored that those who entered alive were never seen the same again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wrong! I swear, I was just after money, I meant no harm. I was only filming Cedric&#39;s daily habits,that&#39;s all,&#34; the man said in a shaky voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He extended his phone towards her with trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the photo album, and her eyes scanned the screen. It was indeed just videos of Cedric&#39;s everyday life.&#34;Why film this? Who&#39;s pulling the strings here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wiped the sweat from his brow and quickly said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. They contacted me online. Every time I sent a video, they paid me. I&#39;ve never met the person. When I asked about their intentions, they got cautious and told me to stop askingor they&#39;d stop working with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went through the chat history on the phone and saw the man was telling the truth. She snapped,&#34;Leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man glanced at the phone in her hand.&#34;What about my phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing look, Daniela raised the phone slightly.&#34;You want it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man quickly closed his mouth and began to walk away, looking embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a quick nod to Lillian, who was standing at the end of the hallway, and then said, &#34;Give him ten thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela slipped the phone into her pocket, she walked back to her table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she sat back down, Cedric served her some food and asked, &#34;What took you so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping calm, Daniela answered, &#34;The restroom was out of order, so I went upstairs.&#34;Cedric nodded but then hesitated. He realized the gaze that had been following him was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped mid-bite, fork in hand, and looked at Daniela&#39;s face. Something about her calmness made him suspect that she might have something to do with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, they went back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela was in the shower, Cedric asked for the restaurant&#39;s restroom surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage showed an &#34;Under Maintenance&#34; sign outside the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Daniela appeared on the screen, walking up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric frowned, wondering if he was just imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela sat on a small stool in the bathroom, watching the edited footage with a faint smile.</p>
