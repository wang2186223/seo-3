                <p>The king of Loglil had always showered his daughter with boundless indulgence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing her cry like this, he shouted into the phone, &#34;Hamilton, are you truly this incompetent? Can&#39;t even manage a single woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Hamilton&#39;s shoulders drooped slightly, his voice coated in unease. &#34;Forgive me, this is entirely my mnistake. Cedric is my son. He spent years drifting outside, and I owe him more than I can repay.I want to give him the finest life. But now, I&#39;m truly cornered. Daniela is the richest person alive, her influence beyond compare. I&#39;m completely lost. I hope you see my plight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The king&#39;s voice cut through the air, firm and commanding. &#34;If you need backing, speak up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly, unreadable smile tugged at Hamilton&#39;s lips. &#34;How could I possibly trouble you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The king squinted, voice dropping low. &#34;So, Cedric isn&#39;t fond of Daniela and wants a divorce, right?Hamilton, lie to me, and I&#39;ll see to it you&#39;re barred from every mineral resource on Earth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s heart thudded once, but he quickly answered, &#34;Yes, absolutely. It&#39;s the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The king ended the call without warning. Standing close, Hamilton&#39;s secretary spoke warily. &#34;Mr. McCoy, the king is dangerously temperamental. If he catches you lying, he won&#39;t spare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes at him. &#34;So what should I do? Daniela&#39;s ready to take me on. Isn&#39;t it smart to have an ally in place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph paused briefly, then gave a dismissive smirk. &#34;I think you&#39;re overthinking. We&#39;re in Oiscoll.What can Daniela actually pull off here? She&#39;s just blowing off steam after finding out the truth. Do you really believe she&#39;d risk her company&#39;s interests just to clash with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Daniela&#39;s blatant disrespect reignited Joseph&#39;s anger.&#34;And let&#39;s not forget, we aren&#39;t some pushovers. Are we really going to let her push us around?&#34; Hamilton shot Joseph a pointed look, eyes gleaming with edge. &#34;Interesting to see you so openly hostile toward someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph paused for a beat, then flashed a smnall smile. &#34;I&#39;m just looking at things from your side.Cedric is your son, yet Daniela, your daughter-in-law, doesn&#39;t show you the slightest respect. If you back down now,how will you hold your ground in the family later? She&#39;ll only look down on you even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed to cold slits. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s attention returned to the wavering figures on McCoy Group&#39;s reports. The marketing team had been running nonstop for days and finally clocked out, utterly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, the marketing manager-his eyes shadowed with heavy dark circles-offered reassurance.&#34;Mr. McCoy, the data&#39;s rock-solid. Not a single flaw. There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood before the towering glass window, a premium cigar smoldering lazily between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fierce words echoed in his mind-&#34;A billion might feel like pocket change to you now, but you&#39;d better cherish it while you still can. Soon, you won&#39;t even be able to scrape together that amount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The check remained tucked in his pocket, yet it pressed down on him like a slab of granite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took a slow drag from his cigar, &#34;When the market opens tomorrow, I don&#39;t want to see even a ripple in McCoy Group&#39;s stock price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager smothered a yawn and nodded briskly. &#34;Absolutely! Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, inside a private club,The board members of McCoy Group assembled,though Hamilton was absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with energy-glasses clinked, and chatter flowed like wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when&#39;s Cedric finally joining the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows? Hamilton&#39;s losing his edge-he can&#39;t even get his own son to follow orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s not that impressive. He just struck gold with mineral resources-anyone could&#39;ve done it. But &#34;Exactly. I never imagined the McCoy line would produce someone that exceptional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton can&#39;t reel his son in, why don&#39;t we do it ourselves? What do you all say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a goldmine just begging to be tapped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men exchanged knowing looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them murmured warily, &#34;But what if Hamilton finds out and flips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? If Cedric says yes, Hamilton&#39;s feelings won&#39;t mean squat. He can pack up and leave the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And really, why would Cedric say no? Who wouldn&#39;t want to lead the McCoy empire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, a greedy gleam1 sparked in every eye, their hunger for riches plain as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood just outside the door, narrowing his eyes as every word drifted clearly to his ears.</p>
