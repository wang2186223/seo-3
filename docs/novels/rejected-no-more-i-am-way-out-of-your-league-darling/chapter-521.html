                <p>Unbeknownst to Richard, Hackett had stopped by Phillips Group before showing up at his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary, always poised and courteous, had indulged Hackett in an afternoon of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hackett prepared to leave, he left a badge behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon noticing the badge, the secretary offered a gracious smile. &#34;You&#39;re far too generous, Mr. Perry. This is simply too precious for us to keep. I&#39;ll make sure to inform Mr. Phillips upon his return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s smile remained gentle, radiating a friendly and relaxed demeanor. &#34;Mr. Phillips is truly a standout individual. We&#39;ve extended an invitation to him to join our association previously, but his schedule has always been too full. I took the opportunity to deliver this in person since I was in the area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gave a slight nod. &#34;I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Perry. Should Mr. Phillips find some free time,he will undoubtedly contact you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the badge was handed back to him, Hackett&#39;s expression shifted subtly, his smile fading into a stern look. &#34;Is this how Phillips Group shows their regard for the president of the National Commerce Association,by denying me even a token of respect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary maintained his composure, his hands neatly clasped in front of him, exuding professionalism and courtesy. &#34;How is that possible? You are a figure of national renown. It would displease Mr. Phillips greatly if I were to show you disrespect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his words, the dismissal was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, clearly annoyed, abruptly exited with a final jab.&#34;In the future, let&#39;s see if Cedric comes crawling back to me for this privilege.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon leaving Phillips Group, Hackett made his way to Elite Lux, but he didn&#39;t even manage to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, far less indulgent than Cedric&#39;s secretary, briskly turned him away.′′Ms. Harper is recuperating and is not receiving guests at this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident unfolded before the eyes of many spectators, causing Hackett&#39;s face to cloud over with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Richard granted him entry and even accepted a badge; otherwise, Hackett could have reached his boiling point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the association, Hackett broke down crying during a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The members of the association exchanged looks of bewilderment.&#34;Is there a problem,Mr.Perry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, with a wave of his hand and a sorrowful shake of his head, let his tears drop onto the surface of the conference table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s occurred? We implore you to tell us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having served as the esteemed president for over twenty years, Hackett was deeply respected within the community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout his long stewardship, he had only ever encountered two significant crises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first involved Brylee. Her resolve was as hard as steel, and her influence in the business world was unyielding.She wielded her authority with a sharp, commanding aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a bid to unify the community, Hackett had once offered her a chance to join the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brylee had scoffed at the notion. She held a firm belief that business triumphs were earned through personal merit alone-victory was the prize for the powerful, and defeat was the scourge of the weak. Why would bother becoming part of such a′′prretentious&#34; association?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, it would be wiser to invest that time and money into something that truly helped people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her actions spoke as loudly as her words; She had financed educational programs for children in need,extended suppoort to farmers devastated by locust invasions, and initiated a fund specifically for children suffering from hearing impairments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this time, the media lavished endless praise on her. Consequently, many commerce association members started to switch their allegiance. Had Brylee&#39;s sudden, premature death not occurred, the association&#39;s collapse could have been inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the first major crisis Hackett encountered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over ten years later, Hackett had settled comfortably into his role, enjoying the power and perks that.came with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Brylee&#39;s daughter, Daniela, emerged as a brilliant force, posing a new threat to his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela proved even more daunting than her mother due to her forthright tactics. She had openly declared war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several companies under the association&#39;s protection had already been cleverly overtaken by her, and there were clear indications that her campaign was far from over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While outsiders could overlook the strategy, Hackett saw the method in her moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was strategically targeting pivotal enterprises within the association, methodically weakening its structure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett felt the oppressive threat hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the members, he dabbed at his moist eyes and managed a strained smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing major, really.Just a minor hiccup. We&#39;re all esteemed individuals here; let&#39;s focus on maintaining peace and harmony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His vague reassurances only served to stoke the flames of their curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, pressing a handkerchief to his eyes once more, conceded, &#34;Alright, alright. I hadn&#39;t planned to bring this up, but since you&#39;re pressing, I&#39;ll share. Just promise not to overreact. It&#39;s truly nothing to fret about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some members, their patience waning, prodded him further. &#34;Mr. Perry, out with it! You&#39;re torturing us with this suspense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the momen as the tension peaked, Hackett drew in a theatrical breath.′′We∥,here&#39;s the scoop.Elite Lux is flourishing, and I thought, why not extend an invitation for them to join us? Daniela, though young, possesses remarkable talent. So, I paid her a visit. But you won&#39;t believe what happened next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stretched out his words on purpose, drawing out the suspense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The members leaned in, brows knitted in concern. &#34;What happened? Come on, tell us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela dismissed us outright. She claimed that a titan like Elite Lux wouldn&#39;t fit into a petty organization like ours. She went so far as to scoff at our association, saying that even combined, we wouldn&#39;t hold a candle to the smallest of Elite Lux&#39;s branches. At first, I brushed it off-youthful arrogance, I thought. But then, she crossed a line. She actually spat at me, telling me to grovel if I ever hoped for her to even consider our offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room burst into a chorus of shocked gasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett continued, &#34;I even went so far as to offer to resign as president and let her assume the role, hoping it might satisfy her. But do you know what her response was?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The members&#39; eyes narrowed in anticipation. &#34;What did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a tone laden with grievance, Hackett responded, &#34;She dismissed the position outright. Not only that,she proclaimed her intent to methodically take over every company within our association.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, the room devolved into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has become insufferably/ arrogant. What is she implying with this? Does she believe she can just beat us all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Her arrogance knows no bounds. We need to stand our ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Isn&#39;t her company just another fancy luxury brand? We have suppliers in this association who work with them. Marc, consider halting their supply chain to disrupt their operations and force them to reconsider.Make Daniela plead with you!&#34;</p>
