                <p>The employees in the administration department looked utterly deflated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned to Cedric with pleading eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager,holding up the afternoon&#39;s results with a wide grin, turned to Daniela. &#34;Your insights are priceless. You&#39;ve saved me years of hard work. Now it makes sense why you&#39;re the world&#39;s wealthiest person. You truly deserve it. Are you free this evening? My team and I would like to treat you to dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at Daniela with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The administration manager blinked in surprise before offering a smile. &#34;Our department would also love to host you for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces brightened with genuine enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela placed her pen down, her fingers brushing against the thermos that had sat forgotten beside her all afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept over the crowd, pausing briefly on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed him a radiant smile. &#34;Cedric, would you be  able to join us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, all eyes turned to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a subtle nod, and Daniela was promptly surrounded by the eager group, guided towards the restaurant across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, hands casually tucked into his pockets.lingered at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the restaurant, he approached the reception desk and tapped it lightly. The receptionist stood up with practiced politeness. &#34;Good evening,Mr.Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gestured to the private room where the group had entered. I&#39;ll cover their expenses tonight. If anyone inquires, just tell them my wife has already taken care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was more than generous,especially when it came to the key players of Phillips Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t let them be burdened wvith the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private room, Daniela smiled.&#34;Tonight,everything&#39;s on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped out to give instructions to the front desk, ensuring no one else would pick up thetab,she overheard Cedric&#39;s considerate words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning on the railing, she looked down at Cedric below, her lips curving into a soft smile. ltenbi relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat beside Daniela, sipping on the oatmeal while the others dug into their meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the employees, noticing this, asked,&#34;Mr Phillips, why aren&#39;t you eating these delicious dishes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot them a sharp, pointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee shifted uncomfortably, glancing at Cedric&#39;s secretary who sat nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a small laugh. &#34;You don&#39;t get it.do you? The oatmeal was made by his wife. It was brought in this morning but delayed by all of you.Even though it&#39;s cold now, it&#39;s still just as delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled around the table at the comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,lowering his head,quietly resumed eating,the playful banter not quite reaching his focused demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meal came to a close, Daniela and Cedric were the last to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could feel the weight of Cedric&#39;s unspoken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they didn&#39;t resolve whatever it was today, he wouldn&#39;t go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to a cafe downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ordered himself a coffee, and Daniela, an orange juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to say?&#34; Cedric asked, his tone unusually self-assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat up straight,her expression turning serious &#34;I&#39;m here to take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at her, his gaze lingering on her bright eyes which shimmered even in the dim light of the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a slow sip of his coffee,then,in rhythm with the soft background music, drawled, &#34;Do you plan to Keep things from me until I&#39;m upset, only to coax me into letting it go each time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was firm. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;So, you&#39;re planning to be honest with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s answer was equally resolute. &#34;No, not that either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flickered in Cedric&#39;s eyes. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re unwilling to tell me your ultimate goal. Daniela, you can&#39;t expect me to live in constant fear that someone I love might vanish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was strained, as if he were battling with something deeper. &#34;Am I truly so untrustworthy in your eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my reasons.&#34; Daniela paused, letting the weight of her words hang in the air before continuing &#34;Can you wait a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips twisted into a self-deprecating smile, a mix of sarcasm and resignation. &#34;Do I dare say no? 1f I say no,will you just walk away again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Cedric,his frustration bubbling to the surface. &#34;So why did you come to me today?To offer me oatmeal and think that&#39;s enough? Daniela.do you really think I&#39;m some child who can be soothed by food?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, the tension between them thickening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, Cedric waited with bated breath.every second stretching between them. Finally.Daniela&#39;s voice broke the quiet. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedic exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his hand, revealing a palm slickwith sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were harsh, but there was an unmistakable tremor in his voice, betraying his fear that Daniela might truly give up on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric knew he had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t stand firm now, Daniela would never lean on him,never trust him fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now,though,he chose to let it go. His heart felt heavy, as though it couldn&#39;t take much more of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finished his coffee in silence. &#34;When you finally tell me what you&#39;re up to, I&#39;ll come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Cedric rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched as his figure slowly receded through the door,her heart tightening with each step he took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed in the cafe a moment longer, collecting herself before finally leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackie Gray, Cedric&#39;s driver, honked lightly and greeted her cheerfully. &#34;Mr. Phillips sent me to take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela climbed into the car, the familiar scent of leather and cedar surrounding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove, she stared out the window, her thoughts swirling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackie glanced at her quiet profile a few times before speaking up. &#34;Why isn&#39;t Mr. Phillips coming home with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had work to finish and went back to the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackie nodded thoughtfully. &#34;He&#39;s loved you for years.Even before your divorce, he was always watching over you. I never thought he&#39;d smile-until the day he found out about your divorce. That was the first time I saw him genuinely smile.&#34; At his words, Daniela looked away from the window &#34;Really? I thought Cedric had a cheerful disposition.&#34;</p>
