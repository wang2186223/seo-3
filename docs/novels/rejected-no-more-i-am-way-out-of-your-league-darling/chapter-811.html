                <p>No sooner had the words left Hamilton&#39;s mouth than Damon emerged from the hallway, his expression dark and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shut his eyes for a moment, exasperated.&#34;What now? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve fallen for Daniela too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone dripped with sarcasm, the question tossed out like a joke, dismissive and condescending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his astonishment, Damon fired back with a passion that blindsided everyone. &#34;She&#39;s Shim! My idol! What&#39;s wrong with wanting to be with someone l admire? If anyone tries to take her from me, I&#39;ll fight to the death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton almost burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he let out a low, chilling laugh. Brilliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just brilliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here he was, offering lessons on how to win Daniela&#39;s heart, and his sons were tearing each other apart over her. One after another, they&#39;d fallen under her spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire situation was absurd, making Hamilton feel like the world had gone mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! I&#39;ll give you all a fair chance to pursue her,but only on one condition. You must sign an agreement giving up your claim to the McCoy family inheritance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was convinced that this ultimatum would be enough to make his foolish sons back off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his disbelief, all three sons responded in perfect unison, &#34;Deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Oh? Just like that?&#34; Charles gave a careless shrug. &#34;Of course. It&#39;s obvious. Daniela&#39;s a money-making machine. If I&#39;m aligned with her, I won&#39;t even need to lift a finger.Look at how fast her new company has skyrocketed to success in such a short span. She&#39;s unstoppable.Honestly, Cedric was smart to stick close to her from the start. Business is cutthroat these days. If someone that talented is making money and supporting me, why would I bother being a CEO? All that politicking and betrayal is draining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas added, &#34;I&#39;m sure Alexander&#39;s thinking the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was stunned. When did it become a thing to boast about living off a woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over my dead body! As long as I&#39;m breathing,Daniela will never become a McCoy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These fools didn&#39;t even possess a fraction of Cedric&#39;s sense. If Daniela ever got her hands on them, she&#39;d tear them apart instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Hamilton ordered them all out of his study.But Nikolas refused to give up so easily. He stood outside the room all night, hoping to change his father&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stayed resolute, unmoved by their words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was as stubborn as a mule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t be bothered to deal with Nikolas, so he had Nikolas locked in the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as Hamilton was about to leave, Damon intercepted him at the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I&#39;ve never been ambitious. You know that. I&#39;ve never cared about the McCoy fortune,&#34; Damon said,his voice surprisingly sincere, more so than anyone else, even Alexander. He looked Hamilton in the eye.&#34;You&#39;ve always said I wasted my potential, but the truth is-I&#39;ve never cared about the family business.You know my only passion is gambling. And I&#39;ve been admiring Shim for years. I&#39;ve never loved anyone else but her. I know what you&#39;re worried about. You think we&#39;re no match for Daniela, that she&#39;ll manipulate us.So, how about this? Help me. I don&#39;t want a single cent of the McCoy inheritance. All I want is a chance to be with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Damon dropped to his knees with a thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you completely lost your mind? Hamilton&#39;s fury spiked. &#34;You&#39;d give up your family for a woman?Besides, are you even sure you like Daniela, or is it just Shim you&#39;re obsessed with? Have you figured that out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question stunned Damon into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Hamilton climbed into his car and slammed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas chased after the car, shouting, &#34;If | figure it out, will you give me your blessing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton didn&#39;t look back. His anger simmered beneath the surface. When he arrived at his office, his mood had only worsened, especially when he looked out the window and spotted Daniela across the street in the opposite building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met for a brief moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s glare was ice-cold toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised a brow and turned to Cedric beside her. &#34;Has Hamilton lost his mind? He&#39;s acting like a man with no manners left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric barely looked up, locked in his financial report. &#34;Who knows? Just ignore him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton overheard. His jaw tightened as he closed his eyes, trying to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Storming into the elevator, he was met by his well-meaning secretary, who attempted to ease the tension. &#34;Sir, there&#39;s really no need to be so upset.Daniela is clearly talented. It&#39;s no surprise your sons are drawn to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the secretary, Daniela was a radiant gem, no wonder people were drawn to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, if she ended up marrying into the McCoy family, it would be a powerful aliance. A win-win situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton wasn&#39;t convinced. &#34;You don&#39;t understand. People change. Right now, she&#39;s infatuated with Cedric. Everything looks perfect.But what happens when that affection fades?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d once made grand promises to Cedric&#39;s mother as well. And how had that turned out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone asked him now what she looked like, he wouldn&#39;t even recall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the reality of human emotions. Even the deepest love could wither with time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he wasn&#39;t about to risk his sons or the future of McCoy Group on something so fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned sharply to his secretary. &#34;Get Alexander in here.Now!&#34;</p>
