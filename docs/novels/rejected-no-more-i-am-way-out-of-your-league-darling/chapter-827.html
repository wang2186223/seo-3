                <p>A spike of nerves shot through Damon as soon as Hamilton&#39;s question landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he actually uncovered anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly,no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that stood out was Cedric&#39;s remarkable talent in the kitchen-his homemade meals easily rivaled those whipped up by his father&#39;s chefs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d also picked up on the fact that Daniela clearly favored Cedric, showing a warmth toward him that she never extended to him or Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, he&#39;d realized Daniela wwas more than a gambling prodigy-her gaming skills were top-tier too,leaving Damon genuinely impressed on more than one occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overall, life in Daniela&#39;s place was nothing short of comfortable-apart from that single drawback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d grown so at ease, he&#39;d nearly forgotten he had a family of his own to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s sneer cut through the haze. &#34;Damon, unless you&#39;ve got something real to share, pack up your things and come home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon nearly blurted out a firm &#34;No!&#34; before he caught himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, his brothers were like cash-printing machines. Growing up, he&#39;d never had genuine friends-anyone close to him always saw the McCoy name first, not the person underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here,though,everything played out differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody cared that he was a McCoy. He didn&#39;t have to fake an interest in profit margins just to win his father&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could finally drop the act. For once, he got to be just himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Daniela had downtime, she&#39;d invite him to play dice and even taught him some tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He relished every second in this villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could make him go back now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on a show, he protested, &#34;Father, you&#39;ve got me all wrong! I&#39;ve always looked out for the family&#39;s interests. Lately, I&#39;ve even picked up whispers that Daniela&#39;s gearing up for some massive new business venture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes, unconvinced.&#34;What kind of business are we talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon forced a smile and replied, &#34;From what I&#39;ve gathered, she&#39;s setting her sights on our mining business now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family had risen to power by dominating the mining trade, their empire cemented by the vast resources unique to Oiscoll&#39;s landscape. Ruthless strategies and a singular hold on those mineral-rich lands had allowed them to crush the competition for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously, his words slicing through the line.&#34;SODaniela&#39;s thinking that big,huh? Fine. Keep tabs on her and report everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Damon answered quickly. &#34;I&#39;ll end the call now. Take care, Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s own experience had taught him never to underestimate Daniela-her knack for turning anything profitable into a gold mine demanded his full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a curt command, he redirected his men&#39;s focus to the mines before summoning Alexander to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be clear-I didn&#39;t place you in charge of a branch company to line my pockets. The McCoy family&#39;s wealth isn&#39;t exactly in short supply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lounged in the chairman&#39;s seat, his eyes cold but radiating quiet auuthority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander bristled with frustration. &#34;I&#39;m doing my best. But every time I try to make headway with Daniela, your two sons pop up to block me. I can barely get close to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought to keep his irritation in check, forcing his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time he&#39;d nearly managed to catch Daniela alone, but the two brothers hovered around her constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he tried to approach, they&#39;d swoop in and block him off, acting like her bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton brushed aside his frustration. &#34;I&#39;ll deal with them later. That&#39;s not why I called you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Then what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone was casual but loaded. &#34;You&#39;ve known Daniela for years. She had feelings for you once,didn&#39;t she? You ought to know if she has any real vulnerabilities. Not minor faults-deep, hardwired weaknesses. I want to hear those.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s words triggered an old memory in Alexander&#39;s mind, but he feigned indifference. &#34;What kind of weakness could she possibly have? She&#39;s tougher than half the men I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes glinted, his stare cold and heavy with threat. &#34;Is that what you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze sliced through the air, cold and suffocating. &#34;Listen, if I want you as a manager, you&#39;ll have the job.But if I decide otherwise, you will be driven out of Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s jaw locked as he struggled for words, his teeth grinding in silent frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected wave of hesitation washed over him; the thought of betraying Daniela&#39;s weakness to others sat uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, Mr. McCoy. Honestly, I haven&#39;t discovered any critical weaknesses in her. She&#39;s got her quirks, but nothing serious. Back when Daniela was interested in me, I didn&#39;t give it much thought,so l never picked up on any real vulnerabilities.&#34; With a casual shrug, he added, &#34;I&#39;ll keep an eye out, if you&#39;d like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton dismissed him with a wave, clearly done with the conversation. &#34;UJnderstood. There&#39;s a bidding meeting tomorrow-Daniela will be present. Make sure you&#39;re ready.&#34; &#34;Will do,&#34; Alexander replied. As soon as he stepped out of Hamilton&#39;s office, a wave of relief washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, he&#39;d assumed Daniela&#39;s weakness was her fear of heights, but that wasn&#39;t it atall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, her real weakness was the sight of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What haunted her most was losing her mother at such a young age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would ever suspect that the formidable leader of Cealmaur carried a secret fear-blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t picked up on it before, but once, after a cat darted under his car, he stepped out to find blood smeared across his suit. That moment, he caught an odd flicker in Daniela&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, he later engineered a scene where a blood bag&#34;accidentally&#34; fell and burst at Daniela&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stiffened, her face paling in a split second. That was all Alexander needed to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of how much time had passed, those childhood scars clung to her, stubborn and unhealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood unsettled her in a way she could never fully suppress. No matter how hard Daniela tried to hide it, the sudden drain of color from her face gave her away-a primal, deep-seated terror that even the toughest person couldn&#39;t will away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the hidden weakness in Daniela&#39;s otherwise unbreakable armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton gazed out through the expansive window of his office, eyes narrowed against the glare as he tracked Alexander&#39;s brisk descent down the building&#39;s steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned sharply to his secretary. &#34;Keep Alexander under round-the-clock watch. Tap every call he makes,and pay special attention to anything related to Daniela&#39;s weakness. And&#39;I want a seasoned private investigator digging into Daniela&#39;s entire history. When you&#39;ve gathered everything, hand it all over to a skilled psychologist. I want a precise reading on Daniela&#39;s true weakness.&#34;</p>
