                <p>If Alexander were honest with himself, he&#39;d acknowledge the deep-seated jealousy he still harbored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much time elapsed, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Cedric had stolen Daniela from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The affection Cedric basked in now belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, however, Alexander refrained from rushing upstairs in a fit of impulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he moved carefully, determined to ensure Daniela would find her way back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander left, his gaze lingered on Daniela&#39;s office door.His fists clenched tightly before he disappeared into the night&#39;s shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the office, silence hung heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had briefly lifted his gaze from the laptop, only to lower it back again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat quietly, waiting patiently in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ten minutes, Cedric broke the quiet. His voice was even,yet edged with something unreadable. &#34;You once said I had the right to decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze and replied, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric went on, &#34;You said I&#39;d decide on whether we continue or part ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela still responded, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said, &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t quite understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes darted as her throat suddenly dried.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s mind churned momentarily, thewords weighing heavily on him before he spoke. &#34;If you don&#39;t trust me, why did you accomplish so much with me, even marrying me? But if you trust me, why keep parts of your life hidden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t believe her intentions were only to have sex with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost wished Daniela was after something tangible from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least then, he wouldn&#39;t feel so vulnerable,constantly anxious about being rejected at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, tell me the reason. Why won&#39;t you tell me?Why did you marry me if you&#39;re only going to shut me out?&#34; His hands curled into fists as he struggled to  maintain his composure. &#34;Don&#39;t make me feel like a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his words hit Daniela like a blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never meant to make him feel this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her only intention was to make him happy but everything had gone wrong somewhere along the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; she began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s back remained turned, his rigid frame a wall between Daniela and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silhouette radiated an air of silence and severity.&#34;If you can&#39;t tell me the truth, don&#39;t lie either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught in Daniela&#39;s throat, leaving her unable to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room sank back into a heavy and oppressive silence again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never meant to deceive you, but I can&#39;t explain the reason right now. What I said still stands, so the choice is yours.&#34; Daniela knew she was being unreasonable but she had no choice. &#34;Or we could take a break for now and wait until later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the only solution Daniela could come up with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once l&#39;ve sorted everything out, we can pick up where we left off,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, the chaos would be behind them, and Cedric&#39;s past would no longer weigh him down.Daniela was certain she could smooth out every wrinkle and set things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you&#39;re still willing by then, I&#39;ll return to bring you home,&#34; she concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips twitched into a faint smile. &#34;Really? Wait?Wait until the danger passes? Wait for the convenient moment? Wait until you feel it&#39;s safe? Daniela, what about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, his words striking her harder than she&#39;d anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice remained icy as he continued, &#34;Does everything have to revolve around you? What about me? You don&#39;t care what I think. Is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent, pressing her lips together as she struggled to find the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, she finally spoke, her tone soft but resolute. &#34;Yes. If you want to be with me, just follow my plans. The choice to continue is yours. If you disagree,then you can choose...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused momentarily, then continued, &#34;You can call it off.&#34; At her words, Cedric slowly turned around. In the stillness of the night, he met Daniela&#39;s gaze,their eyes locking in the cold, quiet darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single glance was enough for Cedric to know that Daniela had already made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a nod, a self-mocking smile crossing his face.&#34;You&#39;re both decisive and efficient. I can only admit defeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip, the weight of knowing she had ruined everything settling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rose slowly, the chair behind him creaking loudly in the silent room. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll follow your plans and play by your rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt a sharp ache in her chest. She was on the verge of saying, &#34;Then that&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she watched as Cedric stood up, his hands tucked into his pockets. His voice was cold as he said,&#34;I won&#39;t ask why anymore. But whether it&#39;s out of sympathy or something else, Daniela, be ready for a lifetime with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was taken aback. She stared at Cedric, her expression blank with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression turned steely in the darkness. &#34;You said I was the one to decide, didn&#39;t you? Moreover, again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hands clenched silently on the table, her fingers digging into the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really agreed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering Cedric&#39;s temperament, she had assumed that he wouldn&#39;t be the type to compromise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, did you hear what I just said? You wanted me to choose, and I&#39;ve made my choice. So,you&#39;ll owe me for a lifetime. You&#39;ll be bound to me, relentless and unyielding. Do you agree? So now, it&#39;s your turn.Think it over, Daniela. Even if you fall for another man in the future, I won&#39;t let you go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing his words, Cedric walked straight towards the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps quickened, as though he feared hearing a rejection. &#34;I&#39;ll give you time to think about it before you answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cut through as Cedric&#39;s hand hovered over the doorknob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare ask again. His hand gripped the doorknob, turning it, and without looking back, he muttered,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked out of the office as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina and Natalie were standing outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina glanced at Natalie. &#34;Do you think he&#39;ll come back tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of emotions flickered across Natalie&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;m not sure, but when Cedric walked out, he looked like he was relieved of a heavy burden. What does he fear so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a formidable force in the business world. What could possibly scare him?</p>
