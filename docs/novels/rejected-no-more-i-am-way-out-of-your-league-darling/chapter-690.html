                <p>Holding the USB drive, Daniela ascended the stairs with Cedric trailing closely behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered the room, and he followed right behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, an unspoken tension between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, Cedric broke it, asking, &#34;Can I listen to the recording with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded in agreement. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inserted the USB drive into the laptop. At first,there was only static, but soon Katrina&#39;s voice cut through. &#34;Are you just going to ignore this? Daniela is coming to confront me. What do you propose we do?Hackett, if you don&#39;t handle this, I&#39;ll turn to your back er. Someone must be able to deal with Daniela. You approached me in the beginning, telling me once Brylee was gone, all the benefits would be mine.Over the years, the domestic and international markets have been yours, and what l&#39;ve received is nothing in comparison. Daniela is a real threat.Are you sure you don&#39;t want to ask your backer how to deal with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording paused for a moment, then the sound of a phone dialing echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, detached voice answered. &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M, we&#39;re in trouble now. Can you send someone to deal with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end snapped, &#34;You&#39;re incompetent! Daniela took over the international market a long time ago, and you&#39;re just realizing this now? Useless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pleaded, &#34;What should we do now? Daniela&#39;s already coming after me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man responded coldly, &#34;I&#39;ll find someone to deal with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, the call abruptly cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording pressed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina asked Hackett, &#34;Can it be done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s voice was firm. &#34;M holds immense sway across the globe. Of course, it can be done. Just be patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording came to a chilling halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M?&#34; Carol&#39;s voice echoed with confusion.&#34;Who exactly is M?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was sharp, her tone icy. &#34;Look into anyone with international renown whose name begins with M.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was captured five years ago, sealing the identity of Katrina&#39;s mysterious contact in a shroud of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet with this clue, they could finally begin to peel back the layers of the mystery.Daniela turned to Carol, asking, &#34;Have you located Winslow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shook her head. &#34;No sign of any personal data being accessed. We&#39;ll continue to monitor the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a nod. Carol then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Daniela and Cedric remained in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela passed him a bottle of water before settling into a chair. &#34;Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lowered himself into the chair beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes met his. &#34;Still upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comfort wasn&#39;t her strong suit, yet she didn&#39;t want to leave Cedric mired in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head, his fingers tightening around the water bottle. &#34;I just feel a bit uncomfortable, but understand you. You&#39;re not that familiar with me yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted never asking when or why Daniela had started liking him, leaving him adrift in uncertainty Now that she had lost her memories, he was totally clueless. Daniela seemed like ice, untouchable and indifferent, as though nothing could ever touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice softened, as though testing the waters. &#34;Before you fall for me, can I ask for one favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her gaze steady. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your husband, legally speaking. So, before you fall for me, it&#39;s okay to feel sorry for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied him quietly, searching his eyes for meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clearly despised the notion of her feeling sorry for him, yet now, he seemed to accept it with quiet resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can only feel sorry for me. No one else.&#34;Cedric&#39;s words were soft, almost fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could reserve such emotions for him alone,could it be that she truly cared for him, in some small way? Cedric clung to the hope, his mind scrambling for solace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, unprepared for the rawness in his voice. She then nodded. &#34;Alright-if it makes you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was clear, his words earnest.&#34;Yes, it does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela agreed without hesitation. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept across Cedric&#39;s face, and Daniela breathed a silent sigh of relief. &#34;Let&#39;s go downstairs for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never imagined Nikolas would be out of the hospital so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had news to share. &#34;My younger brother is coming over tomorrow. Can Tasha get a guest room ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t in the mood to entertain them. &#34;This isn&#39;t a hotel, just so you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas casually took a bite of his meal. &#34;We&#39;re family. What&#39;s the problem with staying here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could sense a shift in Nikolas-he&#39;d grown even more arrogant since leaving the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered, her voice laced with contempt.&#34;Nikolas, is there anything else you&#39;d like to explain?Why don&#39;t you just say everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; irritation flared up immediately. He raised his eyes and locked with Daniela&#39;s icy, warning stare.He bit his tongue, keeping his words to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice cut through the tension. &#34;What family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shrugged dismissively. &#34;Nothing. Aren&#39;t we supposed to be working together? Can&#39;t you even give up a room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance at him. &#34;He can stay here,but if he does, you&#39;ll have to go. The choice is yours.&#34; Nikolas&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused mid-motion, fork in hand. &#34;You still think I&#39;m being too soft? Don&#39;t push me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas muttered reluctantly, &#34;Fine...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as dinner was over, Nikolas made a quick call to his secretary. &#34;Has Ghost regained consciousness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary answered, &#34;He&#39;s just awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas commanded, &#34;Put the phone to his ear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was held up to Ghost&#39;s ear, and Nikolas wasted no time. &#34;Ghost, did you see the leader of Lone Wolf that day? Who are they?&#34;</p>
