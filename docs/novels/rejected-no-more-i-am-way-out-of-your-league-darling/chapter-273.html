                <p>It was the weekend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made her way downstairs and saw the young man, who introduced himself as Johan Randall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; Johan said, his eyes lifting to meet hers with an air of polite familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered Johan only a fleeting glance, her silence speaking volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hurried over, stepping in to explain, &#34;This is Johan, my nephew. He&#39;ll be staying with us for a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she took a sip from the glass of juice Cedric had handed her, Daniela allowed a faint smile to play on her lips. &#34;You seem to have quite the extended family. First, your niece; now, your nephew. Who&#39;s next on the guest list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened, and her jaw tightened. &#34;Well, family visits are just a part of life, aren&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Daniela replied with an easy shrug. &#34;Actually, Peyton was talking about visiting soon. Maybe we should invite her too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Peyton, Katrina&#39;s face immediately paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew all too well that Peyton&#39;s hostility towards her would make any visit a recipe for disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Joyce and Caiden in the midst of a heated fallout, Peyton was undoubtedly relishing every moment,spreading the gossip about Joyce&#39;s personal matters wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina couldn&#39;t stand it, but there was little she could do to silence Peyton&#39;s chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing her frustration, Katrina took a steadying breath. &#34;Daniela, she&#39;s getting older. Let&#39;s not trouble her.I know you prefer fewer people around, so I&#39;ll be more considerate next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed silent, not responding to Katrina. She let out a quiet scoff and returned to her breakfast, ignoring the tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Johan lingered, watching Daniela&#39;s profile with a gentle smile. &#34;You&#39;re really something, Daniela. I like that about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric approached,holding a plate of food, and shot Johan a disapproving look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile, Daniela responded, &#34;I&#39;m glad you do. Hope it sticks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan quickly showed just how persistent he could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Daniela wasn&#39;t in her room, he&#39;d hover around her, constantly talking about his campus life with an eager grin plastered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He played the part of the innocent, carefree young man effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela let him carry on, sinking deeper into the couch as she typed away on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Johan leaned in to take a look, but Daniela quickly handed the phone to Cedric instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a quick look at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The file labeled &#34;Johan Randall&#34; showed one simple message: &#34;No record found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips. Johan, completely unaware, grinned back at her. &#34;What&#39;s got you smiling so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining composed, Daniela answered smoothly, &#34;Just stumbled upon a little trickster. It&#39;s kind of amusing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around Johan grew tense at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began to wonder if Daniela was hinting at something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, it seemed like Daniela could see right through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite the jokester,&#34; he remarked, his eyes fixed on her phone. Reaching out to grab it, he was met with a quick tap that locked the screen with a sharp click.  Without another word, Daniela stood up and began heading upstairs. Johan followed closely behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela entered her bedroom, he moved to follow her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the door slammed shut in his face with a loud thud, leaving him with a stinging nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Cedric appeared with a plate of fruit, and Johan pointed at the electronic lock. &#34;She locked it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm, practiced motion, Cedric placed his finger on the panel, and the door clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric stepped inside, Johan attempted to follow, but Cedric shot him a cold, unwavering look. &#34;Try one more step, and you&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan&#39;s smile faltered, freezing in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked with Cedric&#39;s, and though his youthful appearance remained unchanged, the intensity in his gaze hinted at something far darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan carefully placed his foot back down. &#34;What&#39;s the deal? Why are you both targeting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric flashed a mocking grin, his eyes glinting. &#34;Maybe you should ask yourself why you came knocking on our door,practically asking for trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The forced smile on Johan&#39;s face quickly disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, he was struck with the realization that his cover had been blown.</p>
