                <p>Elite Lux headquarters unexpectedly landed a major order, one that required Daniela&#39;s signature for approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela prepared to leave, she turned to Cedric and said, &#34;Wait until I return for everything. If the McCoy family gives you trouble, don&#39;t confront them head-on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded,assisting Daniela with her packing &#34;I know You&#39;ve reminded me a few times. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ve got things covered here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;You don&#39;t need to keep an eye on everything. Just make sure the design drafts are finalized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a soft laugh. &#34;What? You don&#39;t trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dealing with the McCoy family was never easy, and that left Daniela uneasy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. You&#39;re only gone for two days. What could possibly go wrong?&#34; he asked As Daniela boarded the plane, Cedric wrapped his arms around her in a reassuring hug &#34;It&#39;s okay I&#39;ll be here,waiting for you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane soared into the sky</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric made his way back to the building, where the design phase was complete, and construction had kicked off Yet, the McCoy family&#39;s sway had caused significant delays, with many materials still not delivered, halting the workers&#39; progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several projects Daniela had previously negotiated had to be temporarily shelved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fearing the situation, Daniela had decided not to bring Carol along this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol watched as Cedric contacted suppliers for the building materials. &#34;You don&#39;t need to call them. I&#39;ve already tried. The McCoy family&#39;s influence makes them too afraid to do business with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,by afternoon, the building materials arrived.Carol was taken aback when she saw the materials were all of exceptional quality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked Cedric, &#34;Did you pay a premium for these?That&#39;s impossible. I offered them more before, and they refused. They&#39;re terrified of the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carol spoke, a worker approached Cedric,reporting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that they were short on manpower and the project would face delays</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped outside to make another call</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had taken the responsibility for this issue. She&#39;d reached out to several staffing companies, but each time the McCoy family was mentioned, they refused to cooperate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was during this time that Carol fully grasped the truth behind the saying-Oiscoll was, in essence, the McCoy family&#39;s territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said to Cedric, &#34;Finding people is impossible. You can see the extent of my efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words faded, a crowd of professional builders suddenly poured in, filling the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked in disbelief. &#34;Where on earth did all these people come from? You didn&#39;t promise the McCoy family anything to rush things, did you? Please tell me you didn&#39;t. These are just small problems. If you give in to any of their demands, Daniela will be livid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered a reassuring smile and headed upstairs to get to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both materials and labor now in place, and Cedric overseeing every step, the project surged forward at a rapid pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood in awe, watching as the building swiftly neared its completion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sought out Cedric and overheard him speaking to Daniela on the phone. &#34;I haven&#39;t done anything. It&#39;s just as it was when you left. There&#39;s no issue here.You can stay a few more days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped forward and asked, &#34;What did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered, &#34;Elite Lux is dealing with some problems, so she&#39;ll be back a few days later. For now,let&#39;s stay focused on our work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol observed Cedric as he donned a hard hat and made his way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The foundation of the building was in place. Thanks to Cedric&#39;s brilliant design drafts, the workers pushed themselves tirelessly day and night for two weeks,bringing it close to completion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was taken aback. &#34;You said you had a background in construction, and I didn&#39;t believe you.Now I have to admit it. But how did you manage to gather so many people and materials?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sipped his water and smiled slyly. &#34;I told Nikolas that if he didn&#39;t provide the manpower and materials, I&#39;d go straight to Hamilton. Fear gripped him, and without hesitation,he supplied everything needed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was left stunned. &#34;It was really that simple?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a nod. &#34;Exactly that easy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol inquired, &#34;If he hadn&#39;t complied, would you have truly gone to Hamilton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;Not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gathered the details of the companies Daniela had been negotiating wwith. &#34;Hello, this is Cedric. Yes, I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s husband. She&#39;s tied up for the next few days,so I&#39;ll be overseeing everything in her absence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol watched as Cedric maintained his composed,steady demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a stark contrast to the gentle, composed,and unassuming man she&#39;d seen when Daniela was around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Carol saw Cedric not as a mild-mannered man but as a shrewd, calculating businessman, who was resolute in his quest to achieve his aims, no matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on Carol that, in some ways, Cedric and Daniela were, without a doubt, a perfect pair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a matter of days, Cedric had sealed several business deals, many with companies that had clashed with the McCoy family before and were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had nothing left to lose and therefore weren&#39;t afraid of the McCoy family</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before the camera, Cedric, donned in a sharp suit, smiled with assurance. &#34;I&#39;ve never been one to believe that monopolies are beneficial. We promote diversity and healthy competition. We aspire to see more remarkable companies rise to industry leadership We are partners, never the overlords. This is our entrepreneurial ethos. I know we are new on the scene,and trust is something that takes time. But that&#39;s perfectly fine. I&#39;m giving everyone the time they need to watch us, to understand and accept what we stand for. One day,people will realize that our company is built on principles of fairness, justice, and transparency-practices that benefit everyone. And we welcome the opportunity for you to choose us in the future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s words were nothing short of electrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At long last, the McCoy family&#39;s stronghold over Oiscoll&#39;s monopoly had been shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s new company, standing independent of the global behemoth Elite Lux, had used its sharp business acumen to dismantle the McCoy family&#39;s entrenched monopoly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire industry buzzed with excitement, unable to  contain its anticipation.</p>
