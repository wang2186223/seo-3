                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t waste time with words. She reached out to some well-known doctors in her network,requesting that three specialists be sent immediately to support the attending doctor with every aspect of Cedric&#39;s care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By that evening, the specialists had arrived, ready to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the hour, Linden&#39;s tasks were completely handed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched a brow, silently acknowledging how impressive Daniela was-her quick thinking and decisive moves were truly remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden stepped outside and typed a message to &#34;Natalie.&#34; &#34;They&#39;ve figured out what caused Cedric&#39;s coma and have started him on specific treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie&#34; responded almost instantly, &#34;You need to get rid of Cedric now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting against the wall, Linden pushed his glasses up and let out a frosty smile. &#34;Daniela&#39;s sharp. Doing something like this would put my career on the chopping block. What&#39;s in it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came in the form of a picture. It was provocative, to say the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden stared at the image for a moment, then let out a chilly laugh before recording a voice message. &#34;ls that the best you can offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be generously rewarded once it&#39;s taken care of!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden shoved his hands into his pockets and stared off at the horizon. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious. What guarantee do I have that you won&#39;t turn on me when it&#39;s done? This situation is a lot more tangled than l expected. And let&#39;s not forget, Cedric&#39;s food problems trace back to you. If the truth comes out,you&#39;ll have a mess on your hands too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse listened to the voice message, her expression tightening as her brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn Linden!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. &#34;I want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s hands shook with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shameless bastard was clearly lost in his delusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was her precious daughter. Elyse had poured  time and resources into shaping her, ensuring she mastered etiquette and elegance. There was no way she would let someone like Linden drag Natalie into the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie deserved someone like Cedric-someone exceptional-who would elevate her to be the pride of the entire socialite community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s gaze turned icy as a sly plan began taking shape in her mind. &#34;I don&#39;t trust you just yet. If you want to prove yourself, show me some real sincerity.I&#39;m not asking you to take Cedric out right this moment, but I need to see if you can genuinely contribute to his downfall before I even consider giving you what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden arched a brow and simply replied, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Daniela was engrossed in her reading when the monitoring device let out a series of beeps. After a few moments, it went silent, returning to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing close by with a notebook in hand, Linden glanced at Daniela&#39;s composed face. &#34;There&#39;s no need to worry.Small fluctuations like this are fairly common.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes swept over the team she&#39;d gathered.Her tone was firm and cold. &#34;Run the checks again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to the foot of Cedric&#39;s bed, silently  observing as the team carried out their examinations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they confirmed there were no issues, Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the silence. &#34;Run a blood test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team exchanged surprised glances before the attending doctor stepped forward. &#34;Everything appears stable. The body occasionally produces subconscious reactions that can skew the data.There&#39;s no need for frequent blood tests-they could end up harming the patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, at this point, family members would ease up and trust the doctor&#39;s judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical staff in the room were also preparing to hand over their shifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela wasn&#39;t about to back down. &#34;I want to double-check, just to be sure,&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden leaned against the corner, raising an eyebrow,his gaze lingering on Daniela with a quiet intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little choice but to obey, the attending doctor reluctantly carried out a routine blood test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the results were due, most of the doctors had retired for the night, leaving just the attending doctor and Daniela waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden strolled over with a smile and told Daniela,&#34;Why don&#39;t you let my mentor take a break? He&#39;s  been through a lot today. I&#39;ll stay here and keep you company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded at Ryan, signaling for him to escort the attending doctor to the lounge as she waited for the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden slid into the seat next to Daniela, flashing a confident smile. He had carefully styled his hair,manicured his nails, and chosen an outfit that made him look younger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Mr. Phillips seem to have a wonderful relationship,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, her attention focused elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not one to be discouraged, Linden continued,&#34;Couples often get anxious and flustered when facing challenges. It&#39;s impressive how calm and composed you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a slow sip of her water, her expression unchanged. &#34;I don&#39;t have the luxury of panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden chuckled, sensing an opportunity to change the subject. &#34;I&#39;ve heard your business is doing exceptionally well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing her glass, Daniela set it down with a deliberate calmness. &#34;It&#39;s not about success. I&#39;m busy  because I&#39;m surrounded by people with hidden motives. With my partner in a coma, I can&#39;t afford to drop my guard. If I don&#39;t stay vigilant, those who mean to take advantage will win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was briefly taken aback by her words. But before he could respond, Cedric&#39;s report arrived,showing a chaotic mess of blood indicators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden observed Daniela&#39;s composed expression.She exuded calm and logic, her brilliance shining through in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden watched as she took the report and knocked on the dean&#39;s office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the entire medical team gathered to consult on Cedric&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the room cleared, Linden pulled out his phone,snapped a photo of Cedric&#39;s report, and sent it to &#34;Natalie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you happy now? Daniela&#39;s far too vigilant.After this, there&#39;s sure to be some major shifts around here. I won&#39;t be able to stick around for long. If your offer isn&#39;t tempting enough, I can&#39;t take this on for you.&#34;</p>
