                <p>The Elite Lux building stood tall as a symbol of prestige, an unmistakable landmark in the city&#39;s skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ceaseless tide of people flowed around it, the streets alive with honking horns and hurried footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cunning minds of the commerce association timed their move perfectly, striking at the peak of the morning rush to stir up a spectacle.⑪</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As office workers rushed to their jobs, a figure perched atop the Elite Lux building caught their collective gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the building&#39;s entrance was swarmed with curious bystanders, and traffic ground to a halt in the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Journalists stormed the scene like vultures to a feast, scrambling to set up their cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News channels, social media, and digital platforms erupted with the breaking story, spreading like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huey Murray on the Brink-Will He Jump?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the rooftop balcony, Huey cast a glance downward, the sheer height making his stomach churn with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with the weight of countless eyes upon him, retreat was no longer an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey turned to Hackett, his voice tight with nerves. &#34;Hackett, where are the reporters? Why hasn&#39;t anyone come up yet? Get someone trustworthy from the press and bring them up. If I yell from here, they won&#39;t catch a word down there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey scanned the swelling crowd below, his brow furrowing. &#34;Hackett, there&#39;s a sea of people down there.Will the fire trucks even make it through later? Make sure the safety net&#39;s in place. If Daniela refuses to back off, I might just jump for real. So you better have someone ready to catch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett nodded with quiet assurance. &#34;Relax, Huey. Everything&#39;s in place.&#34; Hackett disappeared down the stairs to meet the press, while Huey tightened his grip on the megaphone,steeling himself for the spectacle ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus shot Huey a wary look. &#34;Listen, Huey, just put on an act, alright? No real jumping. This building is no joke-it&#39;s a death sentence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drifted towards the edge, the staggering height sending a shiver down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of plummeting from such an altitude made him shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus and Huey had been friends for years, and Marcus had even set his sights on marrying his daughter to Huey&#39;s son once this storm blew over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno leaned in and muttered, &#34;Huey, just rattle Daniela enough to send the message. She&#39;s a woman-she&#39;ll panic the moment she sees you up here. Once you&#39;ve made your point, climb down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus bobbed his head in agreement. &#34;This height is insane-I&#39;m breaking a sweat just standing here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Hackett returned, a swarm of reporters trailing behind him. He caught Huey&#39;s eye and gave a subtle nod-everything was in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey cast one last glance at the crowd below, inhaled sharply, and lifted his megaphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sticking to the script, Huey bellowed, &#34;Hackett! Who the hell did you bring up here? I said I&#39;m not seeing anyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett played his role flawlessly, his voice steady yet urgent. &#34;Huey, listen to me. These reporters are from Hurricane Media-they&#39;re fair, they report the truth, and the audience isn&#39;t easily swayed. We&#39;ve been through thick and thin. If something is tearing you apart, just say the word. We&#39;ll find a way to fix it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising the megaphone once more, Huey&#39;s voice rang out, raw and unsteady. &#34;I can&#39;t do this anymore! This is it-today, I jump from the top of Elite Lux! It all ends here! Stay back! I mean it, move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters trained their cameras on Huey for a live broadcast, hoping to push Huey into revealing more details about his predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing through their ploy, Huey declared, &#34;I want Daniela Harper to hear me loud and clear-she doesn&#39;t get to pull the strings on everything! We&#39;re honest businessmen. I&#39;ve never committed any unforgivable act. But now, thanks to Daniela&#39;s ruthless financial stranglehold, my company is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end-I&#39;ve already swallowed my pride and pleaded with Daniela to show mercy, just enough to keep a single production line running. My daughter and son are still in school; that income is the only thing keeping their future afloat. Hackett, you all saw it-I threw away every ounce of dignity,practícally groveling at her feet. I begged her for mercy, just a sliver of kindness-but she spat in my face and dragged my family through the mud. I can&#39;t take it anymore. Don&#39;t any of you try to stop me. If this is what it takes for her to let my family go, then so be it. If my death buys their freedom, I&#39;ll pay the price!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cameras caught Huey&#39;s tears as they spilled freely, his agony laid bare for all to see. Members of the business association grew emotional, their eyes red-rimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, ever the strategist, saw an opening. He stepped forward, voice booming with conviction. &#34;Huey,listen! Come down! Right now, in front of everyone, I swear-I&#39;ll cover every expense your family has.Whatever they need, I&#39;ll take care of it. Just come back to us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s words struck a chord, and the livestream&#39;s audience wavered. Sympathy flickered in their comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn,I always thought Hackett was just a shark, but this? Maybe the guy has a heart after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be real-Hackett&#39;s company doesn&#39;t exactly have a clean record with women. This might be a PR stunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? Most of the women at Hackett&#39;s company were poor girls he &#39;helped! He&#39;s a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flood of comments soured quickly, and Hackett&#39;s jaw clenched. He barely stopped himself from snapping at the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, he forced a stiff smile. &#34;Thank you, everyone. If there&#39;s one thing about me, it&#39;s that l stand by my people. Now, speaking of my company&#39;s products-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; brow furrowed. What the hell was Hackett doing? Was he seriously turning this into a business pitch? Huey was standing on the edge of a skyscraper, for God&#39;s sake. And Hackett was out here selling himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust flickered across Marcus&#39; face. He had seen Hackett&#39;s cunning before, but this was something else entirely.Without thinking, he yanked Hackett&#39;s sleeve sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett gave a forced chuckle and quickly backtracked.&#34;Okay, okay, forget that. Right now, saving our friend is what matters most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression tightened, irritation flickering beneath the surface as he refocused on Huey. &#34;Huey, don&#39;t do anything reckless! We can sort this out. What you want is for Daniela to back off from your family, right? I&#39;l get someone to bring her here, okay?&#34;</p>
