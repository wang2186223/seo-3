                <p>Cedric&#39;s words wiped the smug grin off Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Cedric&#39;s car pulled up before Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric&#39;s car disappeared into the distance,Alexander stood frozen, seething at his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who does he think he is? How dare he go up against me? Phillips Group is barely staying afloat! He&#39;s nothing now! And he&#39;s crippled! What&#39;s he so smug about? A mere marriage certificate? There are countless couples whose marriages exist in name only!As long as Daniela has no feelings for Cedric, they could get divorced at any time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ranted for a while, and when his car finally arrived, he took out his frustration on the driver too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His car sped towards Daniela&#39;s follow-up appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander reached the hospital, Cedric was already standing at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending doctor stepped out, removed his mask,and hesitated upon noticing both men standing at the entrance. &#34;And you both are...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly responded, &#34;I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s ex-husband, but we&#39;re getting remarried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unfazed, stated, &#34;I&#39;m her husband. And I have no plans of divorcing her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor blinked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol emerged from behind the two men and addressed the doctor. &#34;If there&#39;s anything to discuss,please speak with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, recognizing Carol, exhaled and assured,&#34;It&#39;s nothing serious. Her recovery is progressing well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s missing large chunks of her memory. What caused it? Can she get it back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric locked eyes with the doctor, while Alexander stiffened,his anxiety evident. The last thing he wanted was for Daniela&#39;s memories to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor clarified, &#34;The bomb explosion likely caused the memory loss. While it may return gradually over time, there&#39;s no guarantee. At this point, there are two choices. If her family believes these memories are crucial and must be recovered quickly,she can take medication to force the restoration.However, the medication comes with side effects, the nature of which remains uncertain at this stage.&#34; Alexander cut in without hesitation, &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter.That period of memory isn&#39;t important at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only cared about the memories that included him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol frowned,exchanged a glance with Cedric, then turned back. &#34;If she skips the medication, does that mean she may never remember that time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor responded, &#34;It&#39;s difficult to predict. It could come back in an instant, or it might remain lost forever. Only time will tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other than Alexander, who was visibly uneasy, the others fell into a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to Cedric. &#34;You&#39;re her husband. That makes you the closest person to her. If anyone has the right to decide, it should be you. This memory means the most to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, unable to hold back, burst out, &#34;How can you be so reckless? Daniela doesn&#39;t even remember Cedric! Why should he get to decide? Would she ever agree to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flared in Alexander&#39;s voice. &#34;The doctor literally said there are side effects! Were you not listening? If anything happens, will you take responsibility? Can you even handle that? Or did Cedric pay you off to ignore Daniela&#39;s well-being?&#34; Carol, completely uninterested in engaging further,shot Alexander a frosty glare. &#34;Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t see through you! You&#39;re just the ex! And an ex should know when to back off! So why don&#39;t you do us all a favor and disappear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had always been hot-tempered, but after everything that had happened over the past three years,she had learned to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had forced herself to tolerate a lot, but faced with Alexander&#39;s blatant audacity, her patience snapped in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor observed the rising tension and suggested,&#34;Perhaps you should take some time to think this through before making a decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes settled on Cedric, silently waiting for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric maintained his usual composed and courteous manner. &#34;If we choose not to force the memory back,there&#39;s no need for medication, correct? We can &#39;simply let time take its course without any risk to her health?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor gave a small nod. &#34;That&#39;s correct. Other than the memory loss, she&#39;s in excellent health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Cedric&#39;s lips-a rare sight his secretary hadn&#39;t witnessed in three long years. &#34;Then we&#39;ll skip the medication. The lost memory isn&#39;t important-what truly matters is her health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Cedric&#39;s decision as Daniela&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Carol and Alexander were momentarily speechless at his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, however, wwas particularly taken aback. He had been certain Cedric would push for the memory recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without those lost years, Cedric meant nothing to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he just accept that so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock on Alexander&#39;s face was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked in surprise, then let out a soft chuckle.&#34;Now I get why she chose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as those words left her lips, Daniela stepped out of the consultation room, her eyes landing on the tense group gathered outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Alexander rushed forward, his voice dripping with concern. &#34;How are you feeling? I came straight here when I heard! I had no idea you were hurt before.Does it still hurt?&#34;</p>
