                <p>When Josh and Jules arrived, the person they had sent was watching closely through binoculars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave the person a pat on the shoulder and took the binoculars from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the house, only the housekeeper was tidying up,and there was no other sign of activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh frowned. &#34;Let&#39;s go in and take a look,&#34; he said to Jules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper opened the door, surprised to see them. &#34;Good day, gentlemen. MAr. Phillips and Ms.Harper are taking a nap. Is there something I can help you with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stepped in without hesitation. &#34;It&#39;s nothing urgent-just dropping by. How&#39;s Daniela these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s laid-back demeanor mirrored that of a relative making a friendly visit, arousing no suspicion from the housekeeper. &#34;She&#39;s doing fine. She&#39;s eight months along now. The doctor visited recently and confirmed the babies are progressing well. Everything&#39;s on track.He&#39;ll return as the due date nears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she trailed behind Josh, the housekeeper added,&#34;Mr. Phillips pays close attention to her diet, and his father sent a bunch of care packages recently.Things</p>
                
                
                
                <p>couldn&#39;t be better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh pushed open the door to Brad&#39;s room. The room was pristine, clearly scrubbed down. He entered to inspect it himself; not a speck of dust was in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He intentionally used the bathroom-it was sparkling,with no trace of anything unusual, let alone anything dark or suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh,unsuspecting,assumed Brad had handled every detail flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the housekeeper stepped away, Jules tapped his watch and murmured, &#34;Josh, it&#39;s nearly two-still nothing? Something doesn&#39;t feel right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave Jules a sharp look. &#34;What&#39;s the hurry? It&#39;ll happen any moment. Don&#39;t ruin the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; nerves were fraying-he was counting on that money to show up in his account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had glimpsed more cash than he&#39;d ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sum was massive-unbelievable, even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The money had barely stayed in his account for a week. How could he possibly be satisfied with that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was anxiously wishing the money would return,and that would only happen after Daniela died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh moved to the door and said to the housekeeper,&#34;I&#39;ve left a few gifts for Daniela outside. Mind asking the driver to bring them in?&#34; The housekeeper gave a nod and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she left, Josh made his way into the kitchen and opened the fridge. An assortment of fruits was carefully arranged inside, and Daniela&#39;s water glass sat inside a sterilizer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh glanced toward the entrance to confirm the housekeeper was still out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He retrieved a barely noticeable powder from his pocket and carefully traced it along the rim of Daniela&#39;s glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the housekeeper came back with the packages,Josh and Jules were already heading toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper called out, &#34;Heading out already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave a casual wave. &#34;Yeah, we&#39;ve got things to handle. No need to mention our visit to Daniela-just keep looking after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Josh walked out confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the packages, the housekeeper stood silently as she watched them depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their car disappeared down the road, she glanced at the hidden camera above and whispered,&#34;Ms. Harper, did I do okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, in the surveillance room, Hamilton, Daniela,and the rest had seen it all unfold. Hamilton&#39;s gaze was icy, his expression burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh had sent Brad to poison you. Now that Brad failed, he decided to handle it himself.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s face flushed with rage. &#34;He&#39;s trying to wipe out my bloodline. I won&#39;t stand for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned against the doorway, her tone composed. &#34;You&#39;re not equipped to deal with how shrewd he is. I brought you here so you could see it for yourself-they&#39;ve never shown me an ounce of guilt or mercy. So I won&#39;t offer them any in return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton opened his mouth to speak, but no words came-he couldn&#39;t bring himself to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to leave, and Carol followed after her,murmuring, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced back over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave her a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled back. &#34;Nikolas should thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol knew very well-Hamilton meant nothing to Cedric. All Cedric truly cared about was Daniela and their unborn children. To him, they were his true family. He placed little value on blood ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, however, still held concern for Hamilton-Hamilton was his father, after all. If this caused a deep divide, it could damage their relationship moving forward. That was why Daniela let Hamilton witness the footage-mainly for Carol&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Carol shared such a strong bond. that words of gratitude were never needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single exchanged smile was enough to express the understanding they both held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh and Jules stayed parked outside the villa,keeping watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t sure whether Daniela had actually consumed the poison Brad provided, but if she even touched that glass, she&#39;d be dead within thirty minutes -no question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chose to wait it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were prepared to face Daniela directly if it came to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They anticipated the moment when Daniela would be carried out, lifeless.</p>
