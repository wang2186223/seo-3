                <p>Caiden&#39;s harsh spit of disgust echoed through the air,instantly grabbing Joyce&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to scowl when she saw Katrina&#39;s hand,which had been raised, slowly drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through Joyce, and she cried out in distress,&#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood just off to the side, her eyes tracking the dark figure in black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly followed, her eyes briefly scanning Caiden&#39;s expression, which was as cold and emotionless as stone. A slight frown tugged at her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny her dislike for Katrina, but one thing was clear: Katrina would do anything for Joyce,even if it cost her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, on the other hand, was a different story. He was selfish, wrapped up in his own world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm resolve, Daniela took a step forward,determined to follow the figure in black as it moved towards the door. Cedric caught sight of Daniela and rushed to follow,but by the time he reached the entrance of the hotel,the busy street outside had already swallowed her up,leaving no trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly dialed for the bodyguards, then turned to find Lillian standing nearby, looking completely unfazed by the whole situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with that look on your face?&#34; Cedric asked,his voice laced with confusion. Lillian&#39;s bond with Daniela was solid, yet she seemed oddly unmoved by her sudden disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Lillian acted surprised, pouting her lips and putting on an exaggerated worried face. &#34;I&#39;m just so worried. Really panicked. We&#39;ve got to find Daniela fast. A girl like her shouldn&#39;t be out alone after the banquet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting another second, she disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s features stiffened. He felt something was off,but his concern for Daniela kept him from thinking too much about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he rushed down the street, he finally spotted Lillian at a corner, casually munching on something from a food vendor, completely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instructed the vendor, &#34;Make it extra spicy, with a real kick. Thanks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Ryan appeared, just as laid-back,even ordering a beer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric walked up to them, Lillian nearly choked on her noodles, and Ryan ended up spraying beer all over the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, weren&#39;t you looking down the other street?Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric squinted his eyes. He had never questioned Daniela&#39;s connection with them, but now he was sure of something. &#34;You&#39;re keeping something from me,&#34;he said with certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had a feeling. It was something important,something that would surprise him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the banquet, Nina searched frantically but couldn&#39;t find Cedric anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows, Elyse stepped out and said, &#34;Stop looking.He left with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at her, wide-eyed. &#34;Who did they leave with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dark Night,&#34; Elyse replied calmly. Dark Night was one of the world&#39;s most elite mercenaries, known for his secrecy. He only ever appeared to Elyse, always under the cover of night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina froze, struggling to believe it. &#34;What are you talking about, Mom? Are you serious? Dark Night is the best.How could Daniela possibly go with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was shocked too, but she had seen Daniela leave with Dark Night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What unsettled her even more was that Dark Night hadn&#39;t replied to any of her messages since then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy feeling began to stir in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This can&#39;t be right, Mom,&#34; Nina said, her voice tight with disbelief. &#34;Dark Night never fails a mission, and there&#39;s no way he&#39;d let a fragile woman follow him. If anyone found out, it would ruin his entire reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dark Night was a top assassin, offered millions every year,but he chose to remain by Elyse&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because even the most powerful men couldn&#39;t resist beauty, and the women of the Dury family were undeniably breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, sensing her mother&#39;s growing concern, quickly tried to reassure her. &#34;Mom, go home. Dark Night  could have returned by now. Daniela&#39;s disappearance works perfectly. I was already looking for a way to handle Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she walked into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her white dress made her look like a ghostly vision.She saw Cedric on the street and quickly adjusted her strap before walking towards him with fake urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, have you found Daniela? I&#39;m so worried about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears sparkled under the moon, something she had practiced many times in front of the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was confident-she knew how to charm anyone with just a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, this trick&lt;had never let her down.</p>
