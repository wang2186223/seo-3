                <p>Joyce&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. She tugged at Alexander&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Alexander, what are you implying? Why would you ask Daniela that? Aren&#39;t you supposed to have feelings for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because of the child she had with someone else? Was that why Alexander stopped liking her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disheartened, Joyce pressed on, seeking clarity in her turmoil. &#34;But Alexander, weren&#39;t your feelings for me meant to be everlasting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her innocent inquiry struck a chord with Alexander,sparking a harsh realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t Daniela promise to cherish him endlessly,holding on to that love forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,reality often scoffed at such ideals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden pallor washed over Alexander&#39;s face as the weight of the moment settled on him. Nonetheless, his eyes remained steadfastly fixed on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he asked the question, he was determined to get an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pulled his sleeve free from Joyce&#39;s grasp,turned to Daniela, and demanded, &#34;Tell me, Daniela,was there ever truly love for me in your heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped the room once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander braced himself for her possible answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,I loved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love for you was profound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why else would I have married you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s heart held a secret hope: to see a flicker of struggle, a flash of regret cross Daniela&#39;s face, or even provoke her to a point of exasperation so intense she might strike him in a fit of passion-anything to give voice to the storm of emotions he believed raged within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, a question was nothing more than a desperate search for affirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander longed to hear Daniela confess, &#34;I loved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,her response was nothing but silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room, crowded with silent onlookers, mirrored her quiet stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes in the living room fixated on Daniela,who remained wordless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression grew cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He attempted to bypass Cedric, but Cedric stood firm,an immovable barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, Alexander could only edge closer to Daniela,his fists balled in frustration, his voice nearly breaking as he demanded, &#34;Daniela! Tell me the truth! Did you ever truly love me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered no response, holding on to her silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s body shook with the force of his suppressed rage, threatening to break through his carefully maintained facade.11SO1it was all a lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued to stay silent, leaving the question unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Cedric, usually so composed, appeared taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slightly, casting a glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood a full head shorter than him, her lips sealed, her eyes hidden under the shadows cast by her lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, that&#39;s why you refused to sleep with me!&#34;Alexander blurted out, his words slurred slightly by the alcohol. He didn&#39;t care about decorum; he was desperate for the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His accusation once again drowned the room in a heavy silence. At that moment, not only were Katrina and Joyce taken aback, but even Ryan and Lillian found themselves caught off guard, their heads whipping around to gaze at Daniela in astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their minds buzzed with unanswered questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten years, and they never slept together? Not even once?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors had long circulated that Daniela harbored a ten-year unrequited love for Alexander, while he seemed utterly aloof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was said that Alexander harbored a phobia of germs, and despite Daniela&#39;s persistent affection,he had never allowed even a simple handhold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Alexander&#39;s recent reproachful tone hinted at a different truth-not that he was unwilling, bout rather that Daniela herself had held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, equally taken by surprise, couldn&#39;t conceal his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, the corners of his mouth began to turn upwards, his eyes sparkling with mirth as a genuine smile spread across his face, its brightness undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Daniela spoke. &#34;I&#39;m very sorry about that.1admit I never had desire for you. As for whether ever loved you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice trailed off momentarily.</p>
