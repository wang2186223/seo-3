                <p>Lillian was certain of Cedric&#39;s loyalty; she knew he would consent to being the bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her view, Nina was more cunning than Katrina but not particularly hazardous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would simply involve capitalizing on Cedric&#39;s charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing too serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Lillian finished proposing the idea, she awaited Daniela&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, thinking Daniela might not have heard her, was about to reiterate her suggestion when Daniela responded with a firm, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was startled by the response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything that might put Cedric at risk is out of the questionn111Daniela declared decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was caught off guard. &#34;But it&#39;s not really dangerous, is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regardless,&#34; Daniela replied, her voice steady and authoritative. &#34;He shouldn&#39;t be dragged into my personal affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was invaluable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regretted involving him in her complex life, burdening him with concerns for her well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to expose him to any risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely not. Lillian was struck by Daniela&#39;s determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seldom expressed her feelings openly. Lillian had never been under the impression that Daniela deeply cared for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At best, she considered that Daniela valued him as a friend and had begrudgingly embraced their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian found herself questioning her assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Daniela truly had deeper feelings for Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pondered over this until Katrina showed up, looking utterly disheveled and distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela initially suspected Katrina was fleeing from someone, but as soon as she entered the office, Katrina began sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you going to address the situation with your dad? As a high-profile CEO, it can&#39;t look good to have a father accused of domestic abuse,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina observed quietly from the doorway, her eyes widening at the accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up and caught sight of Nina by the door. &#34;He is not my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revelation caused Nina to look taken aback, while Katrina, though surprised, seemed somewhat prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re saying you won&#39;t intervene with your father mistreating me? He&#39;s been excluded back home and has returned to town. He threatened to harm me unless you allow him to stay at the Harper family villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was aware that Katrina had recently been funded by Joyce. Despite hiring bodyguards, Katrina likely had funds remaining. &#34;Are you asking for my help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Katrina replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. What&#39;s your price?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was taken aback by the question. &#34;You&#39;re wealthy, and yet you&#39;re asking me for money?&#34; Daniela responded calmly, &#34;I&#39;m a businesswoman. I don&#39;t provide help without something in return. You know this as well as anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina tightened her lips, visibly frustrated. &#34;How much are you asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a smile, lifting a single finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten thousand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed derisively, her face conveying disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One hundred thousand?&#34; Katrina&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her finger mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Daníela! A million? Why not just rob a bank while you&#39;re at it?&#34; Katrina exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face showed no emotion. &#34;If that&#39;s unacceptable, we can end this discussion. Feel free to seek help elsewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was seething with anger. She considered finding another solution, but everything depended on Daniela&#39;s approval since she controlled the property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One million, covering three months&#39; rent. Additional days will incur further charges. Mull it over and return if you wish to discuss further.&#34; Daniela&#39;s demeanor was firm, indicating she was prepared to dismiss Katrina if necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clenched her jaw. &#34;I don&#39;t have that kind of money,&#34; she declared, then dramatically sat down on the floor.&#34;If you leave me no choice, then I won&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all this time, Katrina had come to understand that staying by Daniela&#39;s side was safer than facing the unpredictable dangers of the outside world or returning home to endure Caiden&#39;s beatings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Katrina on thefloor, Daniela let out a slight smirk.&#34;Are you trying to pressure me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile was what Katrina dreaded most about Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It always seemed to prelude severe consequences, as if the sword of Damocles hung over her head. Daniela&#39;s approach was consistently understated but impactful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up,&#34; Daniela commanded, her expression suddenly stern, her intense gaze prompting Katrina to rise swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you speak more gently?&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice shook slightly, betraying her nervousness.</p>
