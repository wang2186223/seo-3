                <p>Alexander departed from Daniela&#39;s office, making his way to Joyce&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce greeted him without a hint of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware of Daniela&#39;snature: generous to a fault unless betrayed, then utterly unforgiving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wished to reconcile, but he knew Daniela&#39;s forgiveness was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at Joyce&#39;s place, Alexander began to undress immediately. Stripped bare, he stood while Joyce appraised him, her gaze evaluative. &#34;So, are you truly committed this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression was cold, his disdain for Daniela palpable though she still occupied his thoughts.&#34;Yes.I am decided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter rang out, tinged with warning.&#34;Alexander, you can&#39;t just waltz in and out here on a whim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed at her statement. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should know I&#39;m neither short of money nor of companions. This isn&#39;t just a spot for quick cash.Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on Alexander that Joyce was proposing a continuous, intimate relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cunning smile, Joyce laid out her terms. &#34;One year, at my disposal. You will comply with all my requests. In return, I&#39;ll ensure Bennett Group thrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories of those compromising videos darkened Alexander&#39;s mood further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s chuckle softened. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Sign this contract and I&#39;ll treat you fairly. Those Videos were merely to curb your lingering feelings for Daniela. Stay true to me, and I promise no more games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was staggered by how completely Joyce seemed to dominate him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need time to consider?&#34; Joyce asked. His jaw clenched, Alexander dismissed the need for delay. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clapped her hands, a light sound in the tense air. &#34;Excellent. Here&#39;s the contract. Abide by it, and 1&#39;elevate Bennett Group. Break it, and your company becomes mine.&#34; Joyce slid the contract across to him before retiring to the bathroom to undress, leaving him with decisions to ponder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint sound of running water echoed from the bathroom as Alexander fixated on the contract before him,his fists clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shook visibly as he gripped the pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander convinced himself that with sufficient wealth, Daniela would regret her indifference. He was determined to gain prominence, to change how Daniela perceived him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hands that barely steadied, Alexander affixed his signature to the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the steamy bathroom, Joyce&#39;s voice floated casually.nce you&#39;re done signing,join me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolutely, Alexander made his way to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam enveloped the room where Joyce, unclothed and relaxed, perched on the edge of the sink smoking a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his entry, she flicked her cigarette away with a smirk.&#34;Carry me to the bath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes were glazed, and he moved as though he were a mere automaton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved robotically, bending down to lift Joyce and placing her in the bathtub. Joyce smiled, pinched Alexander&#39;s chin, and instructed, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander complied without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce stretched out in the soothing water, closing her eyes with a satisfied expression, she commanded as though weaving a spell, &#34;Kneel. Kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night wore on, it became clear to Alexander that his proud, self-respecting persona was crumbling under Joyce&#39;s demeaning demands. Three days later, when Doug returned, Alexander left the villa through the back door, clutching the check Joyce had given him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some distance, he glanced back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hunched over the window, with Doug behind her, yet her gaze seemed to cut through the distance,locking with Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander held the check, a wave of revulsion overwhelmed him, and he vomited forcefully by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recovering, he clenched the check, straightened up, and strode into the darkness, a resolve hardened within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the office, Daniela was immersed in her work. Lillian, watching the news, turned to Daniela with a click of her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen this? Alexander is now completely under Joyce&#39;s control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, recently preoccupied with acquiring new companies and engrossed in her projects, barely registered the gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing the shift in focus, Lillian redirected the conversation. &#34;Katrina also met with Joyce recently.Joyce apparently handed her ten million, which Katrina used to fortify her security. Should we step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela quirked an eyebrow. &#34;Doug&#39;s pretty open-handed with Joyce. There&#39;s no need for us to get involved. Besides, isn&#39;t Nina starting tomorrow? Elyse is far more eager to see Katrina dealt with than we are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Nina made a striking entrance in a vibrant pink ensemble, capturing everyone&#39;s attention. Known for her polite demeanor, she courteously greeted everyone at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lillian escorted her through various departments, Nina&#39;s charm quickly won over many of her male colleagues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailing from the Dury family, renowned for their attractiveness, Nina adeptly used her beauty to influence those around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she tended to look down on those she considered beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her motivation for joining Lux Elite was clear; she had already marked a target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian and Nina returned to the secretary department, Nina&#39;s gaze locked onto Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Lillian, Nina approached Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one hand behind her back and the other extended, Nina offered a shy smile.&#34;Cedric, you were my senior from high school, and I&#39;m so happy to see you again at Elite Lux. It&#39;s great that we&#39;ll be working together once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s expression softened, her eyes misting over, yet she maintained a strained smile. &#34;We attended the same high school, though you were quite prominent, so you may not recall me. We once collaborated on a class project or perhaps a bulletin board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric struggled to remember. He responded with a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he moved to enter Daniela&#39;s office, Nina called out to him again.</p>
