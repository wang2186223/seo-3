                <p>Richard lounged in the warm embrace of the sunlight, his laughter booming out when he heard those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had quite the knack for stirring things up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the president of the National Commerce Association had been alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The National Commerce Association was a prestigious coalition, voluntarily established by the nation&#39;s elite enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only companies boasting assets over ten billion dollars could claim membership, and its ranks were composed of the finest and most powerful business giants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To put it bluntly, anyone from the association was a heavyweight in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association served as a powerhouse for these giants, constantly abuzz with the latest and most lucrative market insights. In essence, these were the individuals dominating the market, skimming the cream off the top. By the time they had their fill, even the leftovers were enough to enrich those on the periphery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, when the Bennett family had been desperate to enter this association, Alexander had leveraged every connection and pulled every possible string, pouring immense resources into the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception expenses had run into the tens of millions, yet after all that, the association&#39;s president had brushed them off with mere words. &#34;The Bennett family only recently soared past the ten-billion-dollar mark.Who can say whether their fortunes will hold? It&#39;s premature to let them into our ranks so readily. Is the National Commerce Association some sort of club you can simply buy your way into?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association then refunded the membership fee Alexander had paid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following this incident, Bennett Group was the butt of every joke in the industry for the better part of a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the president of the association making a personal visit surely had to be linked to Daniela&#39;s aggressive acquisitions. Richard quirked an eyebrow, slowly rose from his seat, and took a leisurely stroll through the garden,circling four times. It took him a full half-hour before he meandered back into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, Mr. Perry,&#34; Richard said, his voice dripping with a theatrically courteous tone as he entered.He flashed a sardonic smile. &#34;This is an unexpected honor! I had almost resigned myself to the idea that we would never see you grace our place in my lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Richard had only ever seen Hackett Perry through the filtered lens of the media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,meeting him in person, Richard gave him a quick once-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was on the shorter side, barely scraping five feet three, with a build that spoke of too many lavish dinners. He was clad in a polo shirt that was a tad too snug over his plump belly, his gleaming forehead reflecting the light as he greeted Richard with a broad, beaming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their meeting, Hackett gifted Richard a golf club valued at millions. Ignoring the sarcasm lacing Richard&#39;s comments, he flashed a warm smile as he presented a badge denoting membership in the association. &#34;There was just a bit of confusion earlier. Today, I have no agenda other than to resolve our previous misunderstandings. The error was purely on my staff&#39;s part, and I&#39;m here personally to set things right. This badge represents the pinnacle of status in our business circle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, ever the persuasive speaker, handed over the badge and rose to his feet. &#34;I&#39;ll keep my visit short today. But Richard, in a few days, our association will host a gathering. It&#39;s essential that you attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before exiting, Hackett passed Richard a list of the gathering&#39;s attendees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, my friend, here&#39;s the list of companies attending the gathering. Have a look, and if there&#39;s anyone else you&#39;d like to bing in, just say the word-I&#39;ll handle the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile unwavering, Hackett made his departure. Richard escorted him to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hackett even got in the car, Richard&#39;s face contorted with disdain. He spat in the direction of the car,ensuring the sound was loud and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett turned, his smile still intact, and gave Richard a parting wave before sliding into the car. Richard stood there, pondering if Hackett had failed to hear him or if the man was just impossibly composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was Hackett managing to keep it together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, a secretary hesitated before voicing her concerns.MIr. Bennett, isn&#39;t it unwise to antagonize Mr.Perry in such a manner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard responded with a sneer, &#34;What&#39;s the risk?&#34; He gave a nonchalant glance at the list Hackett had passed to him earlier. &#34;Granted, the names here represent some of the giants of the industry. Yet, that&#39;s simply the nature of the business world. When you&#39;re ascending, everyone&#39;s your ally. They&#39;re only showing up now to cling to my success and plead for Daniela&#39;s mercy. Otherwise, do you really think they&#39;d spare me a second glance? I haven&#39;t lost touch with reality. In this arena, friendships are fleeting, interests are eternal.As long as I&#39;m an asset to them, even a direct insult would be met with a forced smile. Earning money is hard, but swallowing one&#39;s pride is even harder. All those high-flying big shots you see are merely puppets dancing in the shadows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &#34;Yet, I&#39;ve never witnessed Ms. Harper bow to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s features softened at the mention of Daniela. &#34;That&#39;s because Daniela is one of a kind. She&#39;s got an innate gift. Ever perceptive since her youth, mirroring her mother&#39;s keen intellect. The Bennett family has surmounted myriad upheavals, all thanks to her steadfastness. In the realm of business prowess, she eclipses even Alexander. Were Daniela not a woman, suitors from every corner of the globe would be vying for her attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled heartily, a playful spark in his eyes. &#34;Fortunately for Alexander, she is a woman-his ideal counterpart. Initially, Alexander failed to recognize her worth, but given a second chance, they&#39;re destined for a blissful union.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the secretary&#39;s brow furrowed with skepticism.&#34;Considering Ms. Harper is already wed, is it plausible she would forsake Cedric for Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard replied, &#34;Without a doubt, she will. How long has Daniela been with Cedric? She has known Alexander for ten years. Of course, Alexander suits her better.&#34; The secretary harbored a contrary view. He believed that relationships weren&#39;t measured by time, but by the depth of understanding between people. Yet, he lacked the courage to voice his disagreement aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he posed a subtle inquiry. &#34;Mr. Bennett, do you plan to attend the upcoming gathering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard discarded the association&#39;s badge into a drawer. &#34;Naturally, I&#39;ll be there. Why would I miss out?It&#39;s going to be quite the spectacle seeing those formerly arrogant giants taken down a notch by Daniela&#39;s triumph. The mere thought brings a smirk to my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, the National Commerce Association was a treasure trove of the latest market trends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Involvement in it was clearly beneficial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, with a throng of people keen to ingratiate themselves with him, how could he pass up such a gratifying chance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undoubtedly,he was set on going.</p>
