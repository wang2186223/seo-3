                <p>As Daniela&#39;s words echoed in the air, a chill of fear raced through Caiden. He instinctively recoiled,taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the relentless intensity of Daniela&#39;s gaze,Caiden realized she was no longer the person he once knew. When had she turned into this formidable figure,utterly independent and unyielding? With a fiery intensity, she hissed through clenched teeth, &#34;Pick it up.Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s throat tightened, visibly swallowing his apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing his hesitation, Alexander intervened. He leaned down, scooping up the fallen business license,and extended it towards Daniela. &#34;There&#39;s no need to be so severe. Caiden is still your father.&#34; He spoke with a measured calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela snapped her head up, locking eyes with Alexander. A scornful laugh escaped her lips. &#34;Is that so? Go ahead and wait for Richard to drop dead,and when some bastard shows up to rob you blind,we&#39;ll see if you&#39;ll be singing the same tune.&#34; Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t wait for an answer. &#34;You have one week.I expect every document and account to be in order by then. Fail, and I&#39;ll personally drag every one of you down with this sinking Harper Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a decisive turn, Daniela marched out, her steps resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, consumed by a surge of rage, opened his mouth to shout after her, but his fury choked the words in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela strode from the CEO&#39;s office to the conference room, her heels echoing sharply against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within five minutes, she had gathered the department heads around the polished conference table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the current employee roster clutched in one hand,Daniela briskly checked off several names, then handed the list to the HR representative from Elite Lux.Her voice was firm, her command unequivocal. &#34;By tomorrow, anyone whose name is crossed out better be out of Harper Group. I don&#39;t want to see their faces again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with  Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.</p>

                <p>With a decisive turn, Daniela marched out, her steps resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, consumed by a surge of rage, opened his mouth to shout after her, but his fury choked the words in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela strode from the CEO&#39;s office to the conference room, her heels echoing sharply against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within five minutes, she had gathered the department heads around the polished conference table.</p>

I don&#39;t want to see their faces again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with shock and  disbelief. One of them, his finger jabbed  towards Daniela in accusation, sputtered, &#34;Who the hell do you think you are? You can&#39;t just fire us! Do you realize how long we&#39;ve served here? Do you know how close your father and I are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, leaning forward with her palms flat against the cool surface of the table, met their gazes with a steady, unflinching look. &#34;I don&#39;t give a damn about how long you&#39;ve been here or your ties with Caiden.From this moment forward, I&#39;m the only Harper who matters here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then snatched up the finance report, scanning its contents with eyes that seemed to burn with resolve.The finance manager quivered, his face a mask of anxiety as her scrutiny bore into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addressing the visibly shaken manager, Daniela&#39;s tone was icy as she delivered her demand. &#34;Inform Caiden that he needs to return every single penny he siphoned from Harper Group. If he fails to comply, I will not hesitate to press charges for embezzlement and ensure he spends his remaining days behind bars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift mental tally, Daniela concluded, &#34;The total comes to precisely one hundred eighty million.Additionally, there&#39;s a villa on the east side of the city purchased under the company&#39;s name for Jack Harper.Liquidate it and return the funds to our accounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the doorframe, Caiden felt as if a fist  had slammed into his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched, his eyes wide, as Daniela unleashed a torrent of sharp questions at the managers from operations, development, and marketing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, these seasoned players in corporate politics crumbled beneath her relentless interrogation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a grim, icy realization dawned on Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had him completely at her mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally exited, the conference room descended into a hushed silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single soul dared to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged wary glances before dispersing quickly to compile the information Daniela had commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they hustled out, they brushed past Caiden, giving him only fleeting glances before lowering their gazes and scurrying away to attend to their duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to everyone that the reins of Harper Group were being handed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days of easy rides were decisively behind them. Caiden remained rooted to the spot, watching as those who had previously sought his favor now passed him by without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frigid weight pressed down on his chest, growing heavier with each passing moment.</p>
