                <p>Caiden grabbed Katrina&#39;s hair and slapped her repeatedly, each blow ringing loudly through the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid was paralyzed in shock, while Daniela stayed composed, not bothering to look up as she continued her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Katrina was left reeling and covered in blood did Caiden release her. He was breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina crumpled to the floor, unable to say a word. Her shoulders shook as she glared at him through her messy hair, her eyes full of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden spat at her in disgust before turning and walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room returned to a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, Katrina struggled to lift herself, her face feeling numb. She knew she had to get to a hospital-her face was her livelihood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Limping towards the door, she paused by the dining room for a moment, trying to steady herself. &#34;Feeling satisfied now, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance at Katrina and continued having her meal as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela Harper, don&#39;t get too confident. No one can claim victory until it&#39;s all over. Your mother thought she had it all under control, but she never saw her death coming. You&#39;re her daughter, so be careful-don&#39;t end up like her!&#34; Katrina&#39;s eyes blazed with rage as she shot a hateful look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, kept eating, a small smnile tugging at her lips. But this time, it wasn&#39;t her usual smile.It was a smile of genuine amusement, as though Katrina&#39;s words were nothing but laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was cold and almost mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m laughing at your foolishness. I don&#39;t know what the future holds, but one thing&#39;s certain.Everything you care about, and everyone who ever cared about you, has already walked away. Katrina, have you ever considered this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina cast a harsh look at Daniela&#39;s side.&#34;W?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the power to destroy you, yet I haven&#39;t. Have you wondered why? There&#39;s a réason I&#39;ve kept you around all this time. Aren&#39;t you curious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina snapped back, &#34;You just want to see me isolated, with no one left on my side. You&#39;re cruel, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, shaking her head as she went back to eating without a care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the bright lights, she seemed calm and unaffected, which only left Katrina feeling more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uncertainty gnawed at her, filling her with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why? What are you trying to say, Daniela? Why haven&#39;t you gotten rid of me yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart raced with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her eyes on Daniela, throwing question after question, but Daniela said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silence only fueled Katrina&#39;s frustration and rage, intensifying like a fire out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her pain, Katrina staggered towards Daniela, her voice raspy with fury. &#34;What are you planning?What do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela remained silent, not even bothering to acknowledge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was nearing her breaking point, but the brutal beating she&#39;d endured was too much. As Daniela stood, Katrina&#39;s legs buckled, and she crumpled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to push herself up, she found her body too weak to cooperate. On her knees, she managed to summon the last of her strength and, with a frustrated gasp, demanded, &#34;Daniela! What are you plotting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Katrina a cold, mocking look as she stood over her. Without saying anything, she walked past Katrina and left without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina found herself in the hospital shortly after. It didn&#39;t take long for the headlines to turn, exposing the real Katrina to the publíc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter appeared on camera, disclosing how Katrina had bribed him. He called on viewers to reject such corrupt actions and formally apologized to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s reputation in Olisvine was left in tatters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she couldn&#39;t leave the Harper family without something to show for it in the divorce. Otherwise, all her years of effort would have been for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lying in the hospital bed for what felt like an eternity in silence, Katrina finally dialed Alexander&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized how powerful Daniela truly was. Trying to fight back without a solid plan would only end in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that the only way to succeed was to catch Daniela off guard and strike when she least expected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts turned cold and calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the harsh light, her eyes looked even more ominous, full of dark schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for a spare phone and dialed a number she hadn&#39;t called in over ten years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end of the line was thick with irritation.&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice was low and threatening. &#34;Daniela&#39;s targeting me. She knows about the truth behind Brylee&#39;s death. If you help me, I&#39;ll keep everything hidden. But if you refuse, I&#39;ll make sure every secret comes to light. Then we&#39;ll see if Daniela still wants you by her side.&#34;</p>
