                <p>Moments later, Josie pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the price of the hand cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small bottle of hand cream was worth a staggering ten thousand dollars..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie hesitated, then placed the hand cream back into her pocket before turning to head into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela came home late that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she entered, Daniela quickly messaged Cedric. As she passed the kitchen,Josie opened the glass door and greeted her, &#34;Good evening, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned toward her,replying, &#34;Good evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie retrieved the hand cream from her pocket.Daniela instantly recognized the brand. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina gave this to me,&#34; Josie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled at themention of it. &#34;This brand is excellent. It&#39;s a luxury brand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie looked uneasy. &#34;It&#39;s not about the hand cream. I wanted to tell you that Nina isn&#39;t as simple as she seems. She gave me such an extravagant gift. She must have some agenda. Before going to her room,she even asked me which room is Cedric staying in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie had been feeling anxious lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Daniela and Cedric got together, he hadn&#39;t traveled far. But this time, when he left, he was in a bad mood and had been gone for a week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Josie asked Cedric if he had argued with Daniela,he remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anxiety deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began to wonder if Daniela no longer cared about Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Daniela said, smiling. &#34;Just focus on your work, Josie. Whatever Nina gives you, feel free to accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like a free meal.Why not take it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went upstairs, leaving Josie behind, her brow furrowed with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Daniela and Cedric had truly fought or broken up. Otherwise, Daniela&#39;s reaction wouldn&#39;t be so strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already warned her about Nina&#39;s ulterior  motives, yet Daniela remained unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Daniela not care at all anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie&#39;s heart skipped a beat as she sensed something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and called Cedric, hurriedly recounting everything that had just transpired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic filled Josie&#39;s voice as she spoke into the phone.&#34;Cedric, when are you coming back? You&#39;ve put so much into winning Daniela&#39;s heart-don&#39;t give up now.I&#39;m not seeing any urgency from her. She doesn&#39;t even seem jealous, which isn&#39;t right in a relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was already feeling agitated. Josie&#39;s words struck him like a dagger to the heart. He felt a wave of dread wash over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had returned home just to change. Before leaving again, she saw Josie on the phone, pacing in the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the glass, she couldn&#39;t hear their conversation, but it was obvious that Josie was so frantic she seemed ready to jump out of her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a brief glance in her direction, lifted the hem of her dress, and stepped out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie turned and saw Daniela leaving. She quickly said  to Cedric, &#34;Daniela&#39;s gone out. She only came back to change. She put on a stunning dress-looks like she&#39;s heading out for a date.Please,when will you be back?If you don&#39;t hurry, I&#39;m afraid another man might steal her away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie wasn&#39;t entirely to blame for her distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rarely went to banquets. She wasn&#39;t fond of socializing or drama. In the past, whenever she did attend events, Cedric was always by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, though, she was going alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie couldn&#39;t stop herself from overthinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela arrived at the banquet, many key figures from the finance world had already gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host of tonight&#39;s event was a VIP, so her attendance was essential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Daniela entered the hall, she turned heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her magnetic presence and breathtaking beauty made her the center of attention wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela stepped inside, Doug&#39;s eyes were instantly drawn to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lit up, a reaction that didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Joyce standing beside him. Joyce paused for a moment, then smiled teasingly.&#34;Honey, what&#39;s caught your eye?&#34;</p>
