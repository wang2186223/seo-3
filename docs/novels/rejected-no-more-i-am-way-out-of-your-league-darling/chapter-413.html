                <p>Daniela&#39;s words hit with force, leaving Elyse momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing her chance, Nina hurried to her feet and rushed behind Daniela, seeking protection. &#34;Daniela,help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood, her face briefly contorting with a murderous look, but it vanished under Daniela&#39;s icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a forced smile, her voice strained.&#34;Daniela, Nina is a problem and doesn&#39;t belong at Elite Lux. Let me take her away, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm,leaning back in her chair with her hands at ease. &#34;She&#39;s an employee of Elite Lux now. It&#39;s my call whether she stays or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s jaw tightened so much it seemed ready to  snap, but she forced an icy smile. &#34;She may work at Elite Lux, but she&#39;s still my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Nina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, her hair a mess and her eyes wide with fear,quickly responded, &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela inquired, &#34;How old are you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina answered, &#34;Twenty-two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her gaze softening with a touch of amusement. She remained composed. &#34;Aunt Elyse,she&#39;s not a child anymore, and she&#39;s past the age of obedience. As long as I want her to stay at Elite Lux,and she agrees, no one can force her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Ely/se&#39;s face darkened with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden stood nearby, watching Daniela in her commanding position, a smile curling on his lips.Daniela was something else entirely. Her presence was far more compelling than mere beauty.He glanced at Natalie, and despite their similar appearances, the contrast between them was riking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was truly captivating! Linden&#39;s admiration for her was evident in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse left reluctantly, but not before giving Daniela one last warning. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m doing this for your own sake. Nina is foolish, and keeping her here will only harm you. I know you care, but it&#39;s unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Nina a hard look, her voice cold as she said, &#34;Since Daniela is letting you stay, enjoy it while you can. But once you&#39;re finished, I&#39;ll come take you home.Watch your words and actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Nina one last icy glare before walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie followed suit, and Linden left as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone had gone, Nina immediately dropped to her knees. &#34;Daniela, thank you. I will repay you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela showed no reaction to Nina&#39;s gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night she saved Nina, it was for one reason-she didn&#39;t want Nina to be used by others as a pawn to get involved with Cedric in dishonorable ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was seething with rage! She slammed her foot down in frustration. &#34;Unappreciative girl! What use do I have for her? If I&#39;d known, I wouldn&#39;t have bothered bringing her into this world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie folded her arms, her expression icy and aloof.&#34;Mom, Linden just asked me to meet him at the hotel tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stared at Natalie, taken aback. &#34;So soon?Wasn&#39;t it just...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain.&#34;Linden&#39;s never been with a woman before. Now that he&#39;s experienced it, of course, he&#39;s eager for more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked at Natalie with pity in her eyes. &#34;What now? Natalie, you can&#39;t sleep with a man like Linden.He&#39;s not worth it! If there&#39;s no choice, let Nina go again.Practice makes perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse lingered at the entrance of Elite Lux, waiting for Nina to appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she spotted Nina, Elyse grabbed her and pulled her into a secluded corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get ready tonight and head to Room 1508 at Oak Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina froze for a second, then the realization hit her. A wave of despair washed over her, but she still asked,&#34;Mom, what exactly do you mean by that? Do you think I&#39;m out here selling myself again and again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood off to the side, tapping away on her phone as if this had nothing to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse didn&#39;t lose her temper this time. Instead, she spoke more persuasively. &#34;Nina, you&#39;ll marry one day.Before that, make the most of things. It&#39;s just one night, no big deal. Or should Natalie sleep with Linden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shot back coldly, &#34;That sounds like a fantastic idea!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face twisted with fury.&#34;How can you say that about Natalie? Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! I am crazy!&#34; Nina&#39;s head throbbed in agony.&#34;And I think not only Natalie should do it, but you,Mom, still have that allure. You could do it too! Linden won&#39;t even see your face! We&#39;re your daughters, just like you. You must have experience, so naturally,you could do it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp slap landed, forcing Nina&#39;s head to snap to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina barely flinched, casually wiping the blood from her face. She laughed bitterly. &#34;What, you don&#39;t think Linden&#39;s good enough either? So, you&#39;ve already given up on me, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was beyond frustrated. &#34;Don&#39;t talk to me like that. Fine, you refuse to go with Linden, huh? Then get married! Marry Noel Isaac!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at Elyse coldly, a bitter smile curling her lips. &#34;Mom,is that it? Am I only worthy of marrying an old man like Noel Isaac?&#34; Nina was just twenty-two, and Noel Elyse was already eighty-eight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying Noel would only make her a widow soon enough.</p>
