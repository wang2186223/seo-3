                <p>Marc shut his eyes for a moment, weighed down by concern. &#34;What should we do? My business can&#39;t survive another setback. If you don&#39;t have a plan,l might as well surrender to Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group fell into a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett stared distantly, his expression grim.&#34;doubt Daniela would simply let us off even if we surrendered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed a stern gaze on the others. &#34;She&#39;s seeking revenge for her mother&#39;s death. Put yourself in her shoes;could you forgive and forget?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This prompted a profound silence among the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Hackett&#39;s expression changed as a thought struck him. &#34;We didn&#39;t come up with the idea to kill Brylee! We were merely accomplices. Perhaps that could mitigate our guilt.&#34; Bruno quickly agreed. &#34;Exactly! Let&#39;s approach Daniela. I admit I was part of the plan to end Brylee&#39;s life, but it wasn&#39;t my idea. It was all Winslow&#39;s doing from the start!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley echoed, &#34;And now Winslow wants to leave the association to save his own skin? That&#39;s not going to happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc nodded, feeling a flicker of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexander was in another country,carrying a recent photo of Cedric in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make me look like this,&#34; he said to the cosmetic surgeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon adjusted his glasses and examined the photo carefully. After a few minutes, he handed the photo back to his assistant. &#34;Thee are definitely areas that need adjustment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety flickered across Alexander&#39;s face.&#34;Can you make me look exactly like him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon offered a reassuring smile. &#34;Of course, we&#39;re experts in our field. You can trust our work.However, achieving such precision will be costly. As a frequent client, you&#39;re surely aware of our fees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander handed over a check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon examined it, squinting slightly. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Bennett. We&#39;ll start your facial reconstruction right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then gestured towards Alexander&#39;s mouth. &#34;This area here seems a bit off.Would you like us to touch it up? And would you consider some hyaluronic acid injections?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had a single focus. &#34;Do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to look exactly like the person in this photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon smiled reassuringly. &#34;You can count on us. We&#39;re professionals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Alexander left, the assistant looked at the photo, confused. &#34;I don&#39;t really see any difference from the person in this photo. Why does he need reconstruction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t get it,&#34; the surgeon responded. &#34;It&#39;s all business, and we don&#39;t turn away customers. In cosmetic surgery, patients always want improvements, regardless of how good they already look. If we don&#39;t serve them, someone else will.So,we might as well make the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant asked, &#34;But didn&#39;t he just have hyaluronic acid treatments recently? Isn&#39;t it too soon for more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just use a small amount,&#34; the surgeon said.&#34;Besides, any minor side effects are just part of the beauty process and are usually not significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant still looked concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon continued, &#34;When he&#39;s done, make sure to compliment him. He&#39;s clearly dealing with some psychological issues. He always brings the same photo for surgeries. Remember, true beauty is about more than just appearances. Eventually, all facades break down; it&#39;s inevitable.&#34; The assistant sighed, resigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, Alexander underwent the cosmetic procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the surgery, the surgeon received a call.When he resumed, his hand hesitated briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at his assistant, who appeared anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the assistant could say anything,the surgeon assured Alexander, &#34;This session will yield even better results than before. You&#39;ve made a smart decision coming here, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the surgeon shot a stern look at his assistant.&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
