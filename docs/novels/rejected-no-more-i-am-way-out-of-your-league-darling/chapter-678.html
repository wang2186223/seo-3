                <p>Nikolas&#39; expression darkened, fury contorting his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone buzzed-a message from the Bennett family. Everything was set. All that was left was for him to bring Daniela to the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you laughing at?&#34; Cedric snapped,catching the icy amusement flickering across Nikolas&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was I?&#34; Nikolas asked, feigning innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze turned sharp as a blade. &#34;If I were you,l wouldn&#39;t do anything reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First Daniela, now Cedric? Nikolas clenched his jaw,irritation bubbling beneath the surface. &#34;Oh? And if I do,what exactly will you do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth Cedric usually reserved for Daniela had vanished. In its place was a glacial, merciless aura.&#34;You&#39;re in Olisvine now. Stir up trouble here, and don&#39;t expect your people in Oiscoll to save your ass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened, caught off guard. Maybe it was because he&#39;d grown used to Cedric&#39;s gentle smiles around Daniela, but this side of him? It was unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric grabbed a fruit knife from the table and strode toward the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shut his eyes, exhaling sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This family was nothing but a den of troublemakers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they honestly believe he was afraid of them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ghost arrived, he&#39;d make sure Daniela learned her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very day, Ghost set foot in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made it! My father doesn&#39;t know, does he?&#34;Nikolas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost didn&#39;t acknowledge the question. &#34;Where&#39;s the target?&#34; he asked instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas led Ghost to the villa. Being the weekend,Daniela was home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lounged in the living room, eyes fixed on the TV screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost peered through the vast floor-to-ceiling window, scanning the interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted together in a deep frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the target? The man or the woman?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nikolas, it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he ordered, &#34;Take them both out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost shook his head. &#34;I won&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas froze, momentarily speechless. Then, after a beat,he let out a sharp laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t be serious. You&#39;re the top assassin working under my father, and you&#39;ve never turned down a request before. Is it because you&#39;re hiding something from him that you&#39;re refusing to help me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s expression remained unreadable. &#34;I won&#39;t do it.I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nikolas&#39; amusement vanished. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious. Don&#39;t mess with mne. They&#39;re nothing to you -taking them down should be effortless. Look at the woman.Her arms are so thin. The man might be tough,but you could still take them both easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s voice remained steady. &#34;The man, I can kill.The woman-I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened as a distant memory surfaced.′′Are  you saying that she&#39;s...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s gaze was unwavering. &#34;She&#39;s the most feared and respected mercenary leader alive. I&#39;ve tried before -I failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shut his eyes, struggling to reconcile the image of Daniela-so delicate, so unassuming-with the reputation Ghost spoke of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost absently, he asked, &#34;And if she tries to kill you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;She can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he added, &#34;With ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt his stomach drop. Doubt flickered in his eyes. Was this really Ghost? &#34;You&#39;re the best-undefeated in combat-and you&#39;re giving up just like that? She was injured before. Maybe she&#39;s weaker now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;The moment she woke up from a three-year coma, I went to challenge her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned forward, anticipation sharpening his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s voice darkened. &#34;I lost-worse than ever. The last time you saw me with a broken nose, it was from that failed challenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, stunned. &#34;Then let Alexander handle Daniela. You deal with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost&#39;s eyes narrowed as he peered through the window,spotting Cedric peeling an orange for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, he pulled out his phone and captured a shot of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp click of the camera drew Daniela&#39;s attention,and she turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost swiftly spun around,his back now to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; frustration peaked. &#34;Are you seriously afraid of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Ghost said, &#34;Take a picture of the woman for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Nikolas grabbed Ghost&#39;s phone and snapped a picture of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost snatched the phone back and made his exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Hamilton studied the photo on his phone, a smile tugging at his lips. &#34;He looks exactly like I did when I was younger. Who&#39;s the woman beside him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost answered, &#34;She&#39;s Clarinda, the most feared and respected mercenary leader.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled. &#34;I once suggested that Clarinda marry my youngest son to solidify an alliance, but she dismissed the idea with a laugh. Now, she&#39;s involved with my illegitimate son. Quite intriguing. I can&#39;t wait to meet Clarinda myself.&#34;</p>
