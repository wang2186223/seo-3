                <p>Daniela was testing the medical capabilities of the robot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was monitoring its heart rate and blood pressure metrics, Cedric&#39;s sudden knock echoed through the softly lit room. He appeared, unusually drenched in sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got you looking like you&#39;ve run a marathon?&#34; Daniela inquired, noticing his sweaty brow and extending a paper towel his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely holding his anxiety at bay, he felt a familiar pang of despair-he was reminded of the heartache he endured when she had married Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that life wouldn&#39;t grant him a second chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he lost Daniela now, it would be a loss for eternity..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, marry me,&#34; he blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device in Daniela&#39;s hand slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor at his sudden proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Daniela paused, her words trailing off. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A desperate plea was etched across Cedric&#39;s face. If he could see his own reflection, he imagined it would look both haunted and fraught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, let&#39;s get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, struggling to gather her thoughts, repeated, &#34;You said...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Marriage. You and me!&#34; Fumbling in his pocket, he produced a ring. &#34;I&#39;ve been holding onto this for some time. If you were willing to give Huntley a chance, why not me? Anything he promised, I can offer too. Remember the boy from your past who mattered so much? That boy was me. Choose me, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the gentle illumination of the lamp, Daniela appeared to glow softly. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me sooner that you were the boy from my childhood memories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric mopped the sweat from his brow, his words tumbling out in a rush. &#34;I wanted to. But you had already married Alexander by then, and I wasn&#39;t sure how much you still held on to those memories. I feared it might seem like I was trying to manipulate your feelings. Besides, I left without saying goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied his troubled features. &#34;So why did you leave without telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her demeanor was calm and unexcited even after discovering he was the boy she had once cherished. She was composed, unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt as if his heartfelt revelations could never sway her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My family was in turmoil. We moved away suddenly, and then, I ended up in an orphanage. When I finally came back, your relatives told me you had gone overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was silent for a moment. &#34;You&#39;ve never mentioned this before. Why now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clenched his jaw. &#34;Because you set a trial period with Huntley, didn&#39;t you? I&#39;m scared, Daniela. I&#39;m terrified that someone else might sweep you away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gripped the ring box tighter. &#34;If you gave Huntley a chance on day one, can&#39;t you do the same for me? We don&#39;t have to rush. Let me court you properly. When you&#39;re convinced, we can marry. Daniela,marriage shouldn&#39;t be impulsive. I want to offer you everything you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice conveyed a palpable urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was desperate, grappling for more persuasive words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he had was his sincere heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only have my grandmother left,&#34; Cedric continued, hastily pulling out a plastic folder. It was stuffed with property deeds. &#34;Here&#39;s a list of my assets. I own eight top-tier estates, plus three hundred more properties across different cities. I also control nine companies and maintain over fifty active investments. It&#39;s all worth just over ninety billion. It&#39;s not much, but I promise to strive for more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lillian and Ryan stepped out from their respective rooms, freezing at the sight of Cedric laying his soul bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan mouthed to Lillian, &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian could only shrug, her eyes wide. &#34;No clue. Looks like he&#39;s reached his breaking point!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, driven by a sense of urgency,blurted out,&#34;|promise, the secrets I kept before will never resurface.I swear to never lie to you again for as long as I live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face was a mask of earnest sincerity, his heart pounding urgently. &#34;Please give me a chance to prove how much I care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt he had laid everything on the line, yet Daniela showed no signs of immediate acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was on the verge of despair when he finally heard her soft voice. &#34;Okay, you got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy washed over him like a tidal wave. He blinked in disbelief, then asked hesitantly, &#34;You&#39;ll let me court you?Really?You mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t expected to make such a decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From simply dating, to trying it out, or diving straight into marriage, he had chosen the most challenging path. Yet, he seemed genuinely elated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a smile and nodded.-&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hurriedly pushed all his documents into Daniela&#39;s arms, then paused, realizing she was still busy.&#34;You&#39;re working, right? Carry on. I&#39;ll make sure to be a considerate suitor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exited quietly, even closing the door softly behind him like a true gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian remained, squinting in puzzlement.What the hell was he thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had chosen to court out of three possible paths rather than rush into marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Cedric joking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they were about to inquire further, they noticed someone standing at the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it just agreeing to let you pursue her? What&#39;s there to be proud of?&#34; Alexander smirked. &#34;Do you know why Daniela didn&#39;t agree at first but suddenly did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to him. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hands in his pockets, Alexander replied, &#34;Because she saw me standing at the staircase. That&#39;s why she agreed. She doesn&#39;t like you. She agreed just to spite me. Cedric, you&#39;re celebrating too soon. You&#39;re a tool Daniela uses to needle me.&#34;</p>
