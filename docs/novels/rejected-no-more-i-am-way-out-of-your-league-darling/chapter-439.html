                <p>A sudden wave of unease washed over Natalie. &#34;How could I possibly fool you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Daniela&#39;s return home, Nina was concerned and asked, &#34;Are you okay, Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she spoken than Cedric entered from outside, asking, &#34;What&#39;s happening? Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina quickly stepped aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a soft smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing; just a bit of work talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina understood that Daniela did not want Cedric to know about her struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before bedtime, Cedric held Daniela close.&#34;Promise me nothing bad will happen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela comforted him by patting his hand. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days later,Natalie observed Daniela confidently managing a ten-hour international meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, turning to Linden. &#34;Linden, how long until your plan takes effect? Daniela appeared to be growing more energetic with each passing moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden felt a sense of unease. &#34;This is unexpected. She should be growing weak and drowsy from the dose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had intended to take advantage of her vulnerability in the lounge. Yet, Daniela appeared livelier than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared coldly at Linden, slapped him sharply.&#34;Fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie quickly walked away, not even bothering to glance at Linden again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden,feeling agitated, made his way to the men&#39;s room. As he stepped out, he accidentally bumped into Nina, who was just coming out of the ladies&#39; room across the corridor. He was about to walk away when Nina stopped him. &#34;Linden, have you considered your future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden frowned and faced her. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m bringing this up because I can&#39;t keep quiet any longer. You&#39;ve sacrificed so much for Natalie, yet she hasn&#39;t always been faithful to you. There&#39;s a wealth young man from the research and development department, Tobin Kelly, and she&#39;s been seen with him quite a bit. Not many people are aware of your relationship with my sister. This is not fair to you, given you&#39;re handling these risky schemes for her. If things head in the wrong direction, do you think she&#39;ll support you? She will take credit for all the successes and live a life of luxury with Tobin. Is that something you&#39;re okay with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s expression darkened with her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, Linden stalked Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He observed her enjoy a candlelit dinner with Tobin, followed by a trip to the movies. On the Ferris wheel,Tobin held Natalie&#39;s hand. She didn&#39;t pull away; instead, she blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden felt his rage surge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whipped out his phone, dialed a number, and after a long pause, a voice answered, &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden glared up at the Ferris wheel as it rose high above him. In a cold tone, he demanded, &#34;Natalie, where are you right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Natalie snapped, &#34;What do you want? I&#39;m currently busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden continued, &#34;I miss you. Where are you? I&#39;ll come to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing patience, Natalie said, &#34;Finish your work first, or don&#39;t bother calling me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you talking to? Who&#39;s calling you so late?&#34; Tobin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a telemarketer,&#34; replied Natalie before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden remained under the Ferris wheel, observing Natalie and Tobin as they shared whispers and laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squinted, a dark glow beginning to form in his eyes. The following morning, as Nina stepped out of her bedroom, she heard the TV news anchor delivering the day&#39;s headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, our city was the scene of a brutal murder. The killer tied the victim to a Ferris wheel, which continued to turn throughout the night. By morning, when the amusement park staff found him, the victim had already been dead for several hours. The police are investigating the case, and the amusement park has been shut down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina almost let her water glass slip from her hand upon hearing the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news showed the face of Tobin, who had been dating Natalie, putting him in the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela came down the stairs, Nina looked visibly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other end of the staircase, she locked eyes with Daniela. &#34;Daniela, Linden has made a move.Tobin is dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a quick look at the television screen before replying casually, &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, it&#39;s too dangerous. Stop using yourself as bait. People like Linden are crazy, and the ones behind them are even worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a drink of water, eyes still fixed on the television, and said calmly,11|sthat right? Perfect! I thrive on the challenge of taking down villains.&#34;</p>
