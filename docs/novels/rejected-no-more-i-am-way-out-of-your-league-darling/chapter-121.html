                <p>Alexander furrowed his brow. He was about to say something when Lillian&#39;s sharp, mocking voice cut him off. &#34;Why are you so thick-skinned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words rang out, carrying across the room so that everyone could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this? Daniela divorces you, and you&#39;re still hanging around like a parasite? This is private business,don&#39;t you get it? An ex-husband is an outsider,not an insider. Got that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s words landed like a slap, and the room&#39;s attention snapped to Alexander in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, including those who had just handed him their business cards, now murmured to each other in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of their stares pressed against Alexander,his face flushing with humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething with rage,he shot Lillian a furious glare.&#34;Fine!If you won&#39;t give it to me, I&#39;ll take it straight to Daniela.You&#39;re just her subordinate, and I won&#39;t lower myself to your level. But clearly, Daniela needs to reevaluate  her staff training. I&#39;ll make sure to have a word with her about this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he stormed off, fury radiating from every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, who had been trailing Alexander all day, didn&#39;t get the outcome he had hoped for either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally returned home, his father wasted no time in giving him an earful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop following Alexander around! Otherwise, Daniela will hate you too! That woman is our golden opportunity-don&#39;t ruin this for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the harsh scolding, Keith left in a huff and headed straight to a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a surge of frustration, Keith grabbed his phone and dialed Alexander&#39;s number. However, the call was dismissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was heading straight for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached Daniela&#39;s office,she was fully absorbed in sorting through a large stack of paperwork. She didn&#39;t even look up to acknowledge his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, have you forgotten basic manners? You didn&#39;t even bother knocking.&#34; Alexander&#39;s anger boiled over, threatening to spill out.&#34;What the hell. Daniela?&#34; Why did you let Lillian humiliate me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had already informed Daniela of the situation,so Daniela was fully aware of what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you called Lillian my subordinate? Let me make one thing perfectly clear everyone in this building is my equal. Lillian is my friend,someone l trust deeply and treat like family. I won&#39;t stand for anyone disrespecting her. Consider this a warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she raised her gaze, her eyes icy and commanding. &#34;I won&#39;t be so lenient next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was about to protest, but Daniela cut him off once more. &#34;Let&#39;s at least maintain some basic decency. Mutual respect is the bare minimum. Or should I teach you that too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s frustration grew. He hadn&#39;t even begun to express himself, and she was already lecturing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you treating me like this?&#34; he demanded,his voice tight with anger. &#34;Cedric gets access to the proposal.Why don&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone remained steady,emotionless.&#34;lforgot.&#34;It was a dismissive response, and she didn&#39;t offer any further explanation. Alexander extended his hand, his voice cold and insistent. &#34;Give it to me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t afford to let this go, not with rumors already circulating behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;There aren&#39;t any left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s breath caught in his chest, his frustration reaching a boiling point. &#34;You&#39;re playing me, Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a subtle smile. &#34;You&#39;ve asked to be involved in the bidding meeting,but what makes you think our relationship is such that I&#39;d treat you the same way I do Cedric? Is it because you told me you&#39;d &#39;treat me well&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile disappeared, her face hardening into a cold,distant expression. &#34;We&#39;re adults, Alexander. Is it really that simple to get under your skin? That&#39;s not like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back, a hint of disappointment in her tone.&#34;Truthfully, I thought you had some dignity, some pride.If you come crawling back to me now that l&#39;ve found success, it&#39;ll make everything I ever felt for y/ou seem like a joke. It&#39;ll make me realize that even your &#39;love&#39; could be bought with money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, her gaze never wavered from his, and she seemed entirely unaffected by the displeasure that crossed his face. &#34;I&#39;m incredibly wealthy, Alexander. So wealthy that you can&#39;t even begin to fathom it. And when you have so much of something, it loses its value. If it only takes money to win your favor, then you can keep it.Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned back to her paperwork,picked up her pen, and resumed her signing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her handwriting was immaculate, each stroke purposeful. Alexander stared at her, his lips tightly pressed together. After a heavy, silent pause,he spun on his heel and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before he left, he spat out bitterly, &#34;Daniela!You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never felt such humiliation. Each step felt more burdensome than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander,&#34; Daniela suddenly called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s heart softened, and he turned back, his face still clouded with frustration. &#34;What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout it all, he kept up a facade of dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep that attitude. Hold your head up high. And don&#39;t forget to shut the door behind you when you leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brief softness in Alexander&#39;s expression vanished,  replaced by a harsh, dark frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp, angry motion, he slammed the door behind him, the sound echoing violently through the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, didn&#39;t flinch. She simply let out a small, almost satisfied smile, whle her attention remained fixed on the papers in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment was more than enough.</p>
