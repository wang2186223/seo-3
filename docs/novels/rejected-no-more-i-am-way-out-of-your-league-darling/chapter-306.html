                <p>Caiden clenched his jaw tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a deep, genuine fear of Daniela now-far more than he&#39;d ever feared angering Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brylee, he could smooth things over and return to his usual carefree self once her temper passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela was entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was firm and unrelenting in her stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was immune to both soft and hard tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden now lived with a constant, gnawing fear that Daniela might toss him out of the villa at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever Katrina and her daughter do, it has nothing to do with me. I just want to stay out of it. If they stir up any trouble, don&#39;t blame me,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could see the fear in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emptiness of his pockets and the constant uncertainty were indeed a slow, agonizing torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t offer a single comforting word. Instead, she let him worry day after day, believing that was the only way he could atone for his sins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early that morning, Joyce filled a thermos with breakfast the maid had prepared and set off to visit Katrina at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was leaving,she noticed Caiden but ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression darkened as he spat disdainfully at her retreating figure, regretting everything more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers of rumors people had spread behind his back echoed in his mind. &#34;Caiden must have some nerve. How could he raise someone else&#39;s child so willingly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand. One day, I visited his place when it was freezing, and Daniela was wearing nothing but a thin shirt. I asked the maid why she didn&#39;t make her wear something warmer, and she said Daniela was just that stubborn-she didn&#39;t feel the cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the mnaid was bold enough to speak like that, Katrina must have been even tougher on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden&#39;s a fool. He should&#39;ve cherished his own daughter. I witnessed Joyce pour freezing water over Daniela in the middle of wvinter. Caiden saw it too, yet he acted oblivious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll eventually face the consequences of his actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn,Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been countless similar comments, but Caiden had always dismissed them as idle gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, however, he felt the weight of every word coming to life. The reality of it all sank in, and he finally understood-he was facing the consequences he had long avoided, the ones he truly deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce made her way to the hospital with the thermos in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wide smile, she sat by Katrina&#39;s bedside and peeled an orange for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina lay there, feeling comforted, believing that all the love and care she had given her daughter over the years had finally borne fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Joyce was taking care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,how does it taste?&#34; Joyce brought a piece of orange to Katrina&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina smiled. &#34;It&#39;s sweet. And it warms my heart. There&#39;s nothing that makes me happier than seeing you so caring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As shespoke, Katrina&#39;s thoughts wandered, weighed down by the crushing burden of Joyce&#39;s debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do everything I can to take care of your debt. If things get too complicated, I&#39;ll divorce Caiden. Daniela has a tight grip on the finances, but maybe | can squeeze ten million out of him. It won&#39;t cover everything, but it should help with part of what you owe. After that, I&#39;ll figure out the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Joyce&#39;s cheerful demeanor faded. She slowly raised her gaze, her eyes turning cold. &#34;Mom, what did you just say?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina kept a faint smile on her face, but it faltered as she noticed Joyce&#39;s change in demeanor. &#34;First, I&#39;ll divorce Caiden, and then...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Divorce?&#34; Joyce sprang from her chair, her voice sharp with agitation. &#34;And ten million? Mom, you know how much I owe. Ten million is barely a fraction ofit. And if you divorce Caiden and cut ties with the Harper family, what happens to-me? How am I supposed to use that status to secure a future, especially when it comes to getting married? And what about my son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;I know this is difficult for you, but it&#39;s theonly option we have at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, her chest tightened, a sharp pang of pain shooting through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gripped her chest, struggling to catch her breath. The orange she had just eaten turned bitter in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll work something out for you. Jack can stay somewhere else for now. We&#39;ll rent a place.And...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce found the entire suggestion laughable. Her gaze turned cold, and she fixed Katrina with a steely stare.&#34;Mom, I refuse to return to a poor life. And don&#39;t even mention marrying someone else who&#39;s easy to control. Men like Caiden, who are that naive, don&#39;t come by often. You&#39;re getting older. Do you really think you can compete with younger women?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina bit her lip, feeling the sting of Joyce&#39;s words deep within her. She was about to protest, ready to ask,&#34;Why do you think I&#39;m doing all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce cur her off. &#34;And is this really the only way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words lingered, heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s forehead creased, a look of confusion crossing her face. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
