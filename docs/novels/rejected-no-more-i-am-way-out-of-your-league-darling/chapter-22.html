                <p>That evening, an auction was being held at a hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, ever persuasive, had managed to coax Daniela into accompanying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they took their places in the front row, the event yet to commence, Daniela casually browsed through online comments, a slight smile touching her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nudged her, murmuring under her breath, &#34;Look who decided to show up-trouble herself,with her endless baggage of bullshit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her eyes, Daniela&#39;s smile lingered just a moment as she caught sight of Alexander and Joyce making their way to the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s posture tensed noticeably as she clung closer to Alexander, her voice low and strained. &#34;Alexander,have you noticed? Daniela is still obsessed with you.The moment you walked in, she smiled at you.How utterly shameless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, his expression stoic and authoritative,settled into his seat, disregarding the murmurs around him. As the auction commenced, the auctioneer took his position at the center, his gaze momentarily meeting Daniela&#39;s. Acknowledging her presence, he offered a courteous nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, maintaining her composure, responded with a restrained smile, which did not go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, watching like a hawk, leaned towards Alexander, her voice dripping with disdain. &#34;Look at her, flirting with the auctioneer now! And him,old enough to be her father. How scandalous and disgraceful!&#34; Joyce, overwhelmed by the unyielding barrage of online critiques, lamented to Alexander, &#34;Alexander,Daniela is inciting those netizens against me! You must intervene!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed quiet, his stoic demeanor betraying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the room&#39;s lights faded and the auction commenced, he turned his gaze towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela possessed an undeniable allure, her large,expressive eyes and gently waving hair drawing attention effortlessly. Her smile turned her eyes into mesmerizing crescents, effortlessly captivating those around her. She was the kind of woman who made a lasting impact, stunning at first sight and increasingly enchanting upon further observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she donned a bespoke gown from Elite Lux,quickly becoming the center of whispered awe among the socialites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without intending, Daniela had turned into a living showcase for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the auction unfolded, Joyce, driven by a need to assert her presence, enthusiastically lifted her bidding paddle time and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clearly in no position to fund anything herself -most of the money came from Caiden&#39;s pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed at the stage, her expression one of detached disinterest, while Lillian seethed next to her.&#34;This is an outrage! That money was your mother&#39;s She was the cornerstone of the Harper family&#39;s company. And now, this woman has the audacity to squander it? Daniela, how can you remain so composed? I&#39;m livid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Caiden had used his charm and striking good looks to win over Daniela&#39;s mother, a billionaire heiress.Despite her vast wealth and strong personality,she had fallen hopelessly in love with him, her judgment clouded by affection. Her love for Caiden was fervent, yet she maintained her iron will,compelling Caiden to adopt the role of a docile spouse while he quietly nurtured his bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merely days after the tragic death of Daniela&#39;s mother,Caiden hastily married Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once obedient husband changed overnight,parading around as if he owned the world, reveling in his emancipation and shamelessly flaunting his elevated status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had discarded his earlier facade of servility and flattery towards Daniela&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed he had even convinced himself of his fabricated narrative-that he was the sole architect behind the success of Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no reason to be distressed,&#34; Daniela replied aloofly,fidgeting absentmindedly with a small trinket in her hand. &#34;Since my mother chose to marry Caiden,he rightfully inherited a portion of her fortune.Whatever he does with it is beyond my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian exhaled a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had a knack for amassing wealth, yet she remained indifferent to its allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She effortlessly generated an abundance of income,a sum she regarded as trivial, and she never found herself flustered over mere pennies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction progressed smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a jade tiger was presented, Lillian&#39;s eyes sparkled with excitement. She turned to Daniela, her expression filled with earnest hope, imploring her to purchase the striking artifact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, a founding pillar of Elite Lux, had accumulated a fortune in the billions. Money wasn&#39;t an issue for her;she just wanted Daniela to spoil her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took immense joy in keeping her people happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Owning the auction house, she felt it appropriate to enhance the event wih a little bit of fun by joining in the bidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flourish,Daniela lifted her paddle to place a bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joyce,spotting Daniela&#39;s bid,quickly raised her paddle too, keen on a challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bidding for the diminutive jade tiger escalated from eight million to fifteen million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce faltered,her mind racing against the constraints of the budget Caiden had set for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Daniela sat poised and assured, her manner as she bid radiating a commanding presence of autonomy and influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many spectators, particularly the women, admired her tranquil yet assertive demeanor, coveting her financial independence and confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by envy, Joyce could barely contain herself as whispers of admiration for Daniela echoed from the socialites gathered behind her. Steeling her resolve, she raised her bidding paddle with a determined hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifteen million, one hundred thousand!&#34; Joyce declared,her voice tight with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,poised and composed, effortlessly raised her own paddle. &#34;Sixteen million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sixteen million, one hundred thousand...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela countered smoothly,&#34;Seventeen million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joyce felt the collective gaze of the room converge upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tugged at the fabric of her dress, her thoughts whirling in turmoil.Bidding any higher would devour her entire allowance from Caiden for the next six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Holt, will you continue?&#34; the auctioneer inquired,his smile coaxing. &#34;This piece is truly a heart&#39;s desire.Do you wish to bid further?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s cheeks flushed a deep shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Continue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he suggest such a thing? Unlike Daniela,who wielded her own fortune with independence,Joyce was keenly aware that every dollar she spent was at the discretion of Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s heart seethed with envy, yet her expression showcased only a delicate vulnerability. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she grasped Alexander&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Alexander, Daniela is trying to disgrace me in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could mount a defense, Lillian burst forth,her finger pointed accusingly at Joyce. &#34;Enough!How much more slander will you hurl at Daniela? This is a respectable auction! If it&#39;s beyond your means,just own up to it. Why blame others because you didn&#39;t win? Enough with your theatrics!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s tears cascaded down her cheeks, punctuating her sorrow with theatrical flair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood abruptly, his icy stare ensnaring Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he prepared to interject, Daniela also rose, stepping in and drawing Lillian back. Her warm eyes hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, Daniela!&#34; Alexander interjected smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her efforts to extinguish the old flames, his words sliced through her, painfully sharp. After all, he was the one she had cherished for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips tightly, Daniela fought back the quiver that threatened to betray her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the verge of speaking, she felt a shadow fall over her. A hand enclosed her wrist and pulled her back in one smooth, protective motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the nonsense, Mr. Bennett. Who&#39;s actually crossing the damn line here?&#34; The words, tinged with authority, sliced through the thick silence enveloping the room. His piercing gaze roved over the gathered onlookers, finally anchoring on Alexander. &#34;So,Daniela was once blind to your machinations, and now you presume to push her around at your whim? Cut the shit. This nonsense stops right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the room turned icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze swiveled toward the speaker. It took a moment for the crowd to recognize him. Cedric Phillips, a titan of industry, renowned for his unyielding tactics and strategic genius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Commanding every bit of the room&#39;s energy, Cedric nonetheless appeared aloof to the stares fixated on him. His eyes met Daniela&#39;s, his voice low andsteady &#34;Don&#39;t bother fighting with pigs-they love the mud,and you&#39;ll just end up covered in their filth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur of laughter rippled through the audience,amusement flickering in their eyes as they turned their attention back to Alexander, whose reaction to Cedric&#39;s bold confrontation was keenly anticipated.</p>
