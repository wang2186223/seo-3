                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice was laced with emotion, his gaze locked onto Daniela with an intensity that betrayed his anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, there was no reason for Daniela to turn him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed he was her best option now, someone who could help her make a comeback and rise to new heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps three years ago, Cedric&#39;s influence had been overwhelming, far beyond his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he was sure that Daniela would choose him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I love you. Marry me again. I promise to cherish you, put you first, and love you for the rest of my life. Together, we can be an unstoppable force in the business world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes remained cold and indifferent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the dim glow of the night, she was calm,detached and unreadable. It felt as though she had wandered through a void for the past three years, untouched by light and devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at Alexander like he was a stranger,her distant expression making it seem as if his words never even reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, now noticeably thinner than she was three years ago,met Alexander&#39;s gaze and said coldly, &#34;But I don&#39;t love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was stunned, his hands trembling in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t love you,&#34; Daniela repeated, her voice as calm as ever, almost indifferent. &#34;I&#39;ve forgotten a lot of things, Alexander, but I know that I don&#39;t love you. I never did. Maybe I never told you that before,and if l didn&#39;t,then let me make it clear now. I don&#39;t love you!For the past ten years, I never loved you. I was only chasing the comfort of the boy you used to be. I&#39;m sorry, but love can&#39;t be forced. There&#39;s no reason for us to remarry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the darkness, Alexander stood frozen, shaken to his core.He never imagined that Daniela&#39;s choice would be the same as it had been three y/ears ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you still angry with me? Is it because l believed Joyce during the fire incident? Or because I  took over some parts of your business in the past three years? That&#39;s why you still mad and can&#39;t forgive me, isn&#39;t it? But Daniela, I can explain. Please, just let me explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Daniela shook her head, her voice unwavering.Meeting Alexander&#39;s eyes, she spoke each word with quiet clarity. &#34;I may have lost my memory, but l haven&#39;t lost my mind. I know exactly what I&#39;m saying.My love was never about business, power, or revenge.I just don&#39;t love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose from her seat and without another word,walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained frozen, staring blankly, his mind adrift in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the president of the commerce association and the wealthiest man in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Daniela still not love him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela should admire him and be infatuated with him,the way she once had been with Cedric. She should be at his side, bearing his children. So,why was it like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s rejection was colder and ruthless than it had been three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood still and chuckled. &#34;Because after everything she&#39;s been through, she understands what she truly wants. Alexander, she made it clear. She doesn&#39;t love you. I hope you won&#39;t ever disturb her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and followed Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood in stunned silence, watching as Daniela disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was noticeably thinner than she had been three years ago and the cold wind swept past, making her loose clothing billow around her frail frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t even matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had granted him another chance, and he was determined to win Daniela&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he would ensure that Daniela saw his determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela walked out, Carol leaned in and murmured to Daniela, &#34;Cedric&#39;s behind us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a soft hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had noticed Cedric the moment she started speaking with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since he hadn&#39;t approached, she had chosen to ignore him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to send him away?&#34; Carol asked,knowing full well that whatever warmth once existed between them was long gone. Cedric meant nothing to Daniela and would only be a burden to her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated for a fraction of a second, then glanced over her shoulder at the distant figure trailing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. His leg isn&#39;t fully healed. If he feels uncomfortable,he&#39;ll leave on his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point in saying more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Cedric insisted on not divorcing, there had to be some lingering attachment on his part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried the weight of three years of memories alone, and Daniela couldn&#39;t bring herself to be so heartless as to deny him this small consolation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded and started briefing Daniela on the current state of affairs at home. &#34;Alexander wasn&#39;t wrong earlier. The domestic situation is far from ideal. Three years of silence,along with shareholders leaving Elite Lux to establish Eternity Glory, has turned Elite Lux into a market pariah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod, her expression remaining calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol went on, &#34;The financial gap is massive. Today&#39;s employee salaries came from your personal assets.The funding shortfall is overwhelming, and production has been at a standstill for far too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with another indifferent hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol matched Daniela&#39;s pace and continued,&#34;Additionally, some overseas assets are tied up in disputes with former shareholders. It&#39;s becoming quite a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, Daniela said, &#34;These issues aren&#39;t the priority. The explosion incident from three years ago must be thoroughly investigated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol responded, &#34;The intelligence agency is already looking into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;I want you to look into it personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced up at Daniela, fully aware that she wouldn&#39;t let those responsible for the explosion walk free.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before stepping into the Elite Lux building,Daniela cast a fleeting glance at the distant figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric froze the moment he saw her pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;Have Shadow to continue protecting Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was taken aback by Daniela&#39;s command.&#34;Do you think the ones responsible will make another move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three-year lapse in her memory felt insurmountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a gut feeling that everyone she needed to deal with three years ago had already been handled.Yet, the explosion had happened suddenly, without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, Caiden had escaped from the asylum,Joyce had resurfaced, and Alexander had seamlessly risen to the position of association president. Each of these events felt undeniably suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I believe you&#39;re in even greater danger.&#34; Carol muttered those words to herself, knowing that, no matter the circumstances, Daniela always put the safety of others before her own. They both entered Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped at the entrance of Elite Lux.</p>
