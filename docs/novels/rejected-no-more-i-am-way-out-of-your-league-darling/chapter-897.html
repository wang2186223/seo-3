                <p>Hamilton had to treat the situation with gravity, no matter how dismissive others might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of relying on secondhand reports, he took charge himself, assembling a team to probe the strange patterns in their financial data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hour after hour, the marketing department and its analysts pored over records, working tirelessly through the night, but every search ended at a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ridicule soon found its mark again, with Hamilton at the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the group chat, mockery became public. &#34;Hamilton, give it a rest, would you? Why put yourself through this? Daniela isn&#39;t worth losing sleep over. Our assets are untouchable. We&#39;re the leaders here, so what&#39;s got you spooked? Take a break, go home, or better yet, figure out how to get Cedric back on our side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Hamilton truly felt the heaviness of age and the futility of persistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices that once respected him now ignored every warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading out of the McCoy Group headquarters, he paused just as Cedric stepped into view across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his voice and said, &#34;Cedric, I need a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning at the sound, Cedric met his gaze,face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bridging the distance, Hamilton walked up, urgency in every step. &#34;Yesterday, Daniela made it clear she&#39;s coming for McCoy Group. The board wants you to take control. Will you return? I can&#39;t do this without you,my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word carried genuine desperation this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The icy look on Cedric&#39;s face left no room for conversation. He kept his distance, his tone flat and void of emotion. &#34;I&#39;ve never once considered you my father. You weren&#39;t there when I needed you most, so don&#39;t come looking for me now that the tables have turned. And if this sudden warmth you&#39;re showing is just because you think I&#39;m the reason Daniela&#39;s become the world&#39;s wealthiest individual, then you&#39;ve badly misjudged me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze. &#34;What are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said without hesitation, &#34;She&#39;s always been the world&#39;s wealthiest. She simply chose to hide some of her assets. You were only seen at the top because she allowed it. She never wanted the spotlight. But things have changed-she does now. That&#39;s the only reason she&#39;s stepping forward again. So no, I don&#39;t control the wealth. That power has always belonged to her. And if you&#39;re looking for someone to fear, it should be her-not me.With that in mind, does it really matter whether or not I&#39;m on your side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every syllable carried weight as Cedric fixed Hamilton with a gaze that seemed to see right through him.&#34;Spare yourself the effort of arguing with me. Use your time to decide what&#39;s next for McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paralysis left Hamilton rooted to the spot, unable to process the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denial surfaced as he shook his head, unwilling to accept what he&#39;d heard. &#34;Are you telling me Daniela was behind everything this whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weak, forced grin flickered across Hamilton&#39;s lips. &#34;That&#39;s absurd. You&#39;re just defending her. Is this your way of scaring me off? Of making me believe she&#39;s invincible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempts át bravado faded fast. When his eyes met Cedric&#39;s icy stare, confidence deserted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you honestly telling me Daniela is the real powerhouse, just lying low all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded calmly, &#34;You can choose to ignore it if you want, but the facts won&#39;t change. The truth is staring you in the face. No one builds that kind of fortune overnight unless the foundation was already in place. The only thing that makes sense is that she always held the real wealth. She kept it hidden on purpose, and when the time came, it rose to the surface-ready and waiting for her to take control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing left to say,Cedric turned on his heel, leaving Hamilton standing in the wake of the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lonely gust swept around Hamilton as he stood motionless, his mind spinning in confusion. Was all of this truly orchestrated by Daniela? But how could something like that even be real?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just a woman. How could she possibly see that far ahead? How could she carry out such bold,calculated moves with that kind of precision? How was any of it even possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow,Hamilton managed to stumble back to McCoy Group, lost in a fog of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A phone call from the king of Loglil jolted him from his thoughts, inquiring about a meeting with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation made Hamilton cling to this small thread of hope. Tears streamed down his face as he spoke over the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I tried could convince Daniela to let Cedric go. She&#39;s gone as far as launching economic sanctions against McCoy Group and keeping Cedric under house arrest. I have to apologize on Cedric&#39;s behalf-he wanted me to tell your daughter. Fate simply wasn&#39;t on your side. He hopes you won&#39;t blame him for it.He promised you&#39;d remain in his thoughts, no matter how far apart you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words reached her, the princess crumbled, tears streaming down as she clung to the king for support.</p>
