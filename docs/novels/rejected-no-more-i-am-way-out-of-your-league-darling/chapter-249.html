                <p>Joyce spun around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Alexander&#39;s mind was in turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, he nearly ended Joyce&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Alexander demanded, his words forced through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; Joyce replied, pale and gasping for air. &#34;It&#39;s always been me, Alexander! Release me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve set me up!&#34; His hold tightened, his gaze icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was lying in the bed, her complexion turning from pale to a blue tint due to lack of oxygen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, she felt her life hanging by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dread of suffocating made her eyes bulge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce&#39;s grip weakened, there was a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s fractured sanity began to mend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized he had nearly strangled Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As oxygen returned to her lungs, Joyce understood how close she had come to dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped to the floor, shaking and curling into a fetal position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was overwhelmed with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terror was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t cleverly arranged for a reporter to catch her and Alexander together, she might have died. The door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera snapped photos, capturing everything. In response, Alexander angrily destroyed the camera held by the reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a monotone. &#34;If this leaks to anyone else, I&#39;ll end you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Joyce&#39;s voice trembled like a leaf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed Alexander might actually take her life if she spread the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander seized his coat and stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce curled up in the corner, sobbing quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out to Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, she cried into the phone. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m terrified. I need a divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina came to take her daughter home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the journey, Joyce shivered and remained silent, ignoring Katrina&#39;s questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could say was, &#34;I need a divorce, Mom. I can&#39;t stay with Alexander any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was confused. &#34;Why? Is Alexander mistreating you? Or are you stirring up trouble again? Listen,Joyce, the shares Daniela gave you serve as leverage, but Alexander is still your husband. You can&#39;t manipulate him forever or he&#39;ll reach his limit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto Katrina&#39;s hand tightly, Joyce pleaded, &#34;Mom, I desperately need a divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina frowned and said, &#34;Joyce, stop being so willful. You and Alexander just got married. How can you think of getting a divorce now? Wouldn&#39;t that be absurd?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stamped her feet, shouting, &#34;I just want a divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina became quiet. She decided she couldn&#39;t allow Joyce to remain so defiant, so she reached for her phone to call Alexander. &#34;Mom!&#34; Joyce suddenly screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was startled into stllness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce unwrapped the scarf fromn around her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the harsh white light, a deep bruise ringed her neck. The bruise was pronounced and severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, silence enveloped the entire living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was the first to shatter the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! Alexander is a monster! A monster! Ah! I want a divorce! Do you see this? He abused me, he tried to kill me!&#34; Joyce&#39;s agitation was palpable. Her body trembled violently as she spoke. Her fear was evident to all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina began to cry, afraid to even touch Joyce at that moment. &#34;How could tis have happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! You chose this son-in-law for me! You pushed me into this marriage! He&#39;s a lunatic. Do you understand?&#34; Every word Joyce uttered was a desperate shout. Her voice was raspy as she accused Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she began to faint, Joyce&#39;s final plea was, &#34;I can&#39;t be married to Alexander anymore. I was wrong to be so stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce then fell to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, crying out in distress, tried to lift Joyce but couldn&#39;t manage. She looked desperately at Caiden.&#34;Caiden, come and see how injured Joyce is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden said nothing and just walked over. He assisted Katrina in carrying Joyce into the room. He then returned downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katrina came down, her voice quivered with rage. &#34;I am so furious I could scream! I&#39;m going to kill Alexander!&#34; She stormed into the kitchen, seized a knife, and prepared to confront him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was full of people, Caiden, Daniela, Cedric, Ryan, Lillian, Shirley. They were all watching,yet no one intervened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, the maid Daniela had brought in opened the door.</p>
