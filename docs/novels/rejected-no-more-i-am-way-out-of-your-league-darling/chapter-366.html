                <p>The lively atmosphere filled with laughter and toasts suddenly stilled into an uncomfortable silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a nearby table, Richard could feel a heavy unease settle over him. The sound of the slap made him stand up in stunned disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood how hard it must have been for Alexander to submit to Joyce like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard the whispers and clenched his teeth,hoping that once Bennett Group&#39;s situation improved,Alexander would finally escape Joyce&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined Joyce would stoop so low. She actually humiliated Alexander in front of everyone like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Richard was about to step in, Joyce&#39;s icy voice cut through the tension. &#34;Peel this plate of shrimps for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s fingers quivered as he sat still, lost in the heavy silence of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could feel the scornful gazes of the others boring into him, yet he remained unmoved. He didn&#39;t care anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thought that mattered to him now was Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would she think of him now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she see him the way everyone else did,like he was just embarrassing himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she regret pushing him away, leaving him in this mess?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander bit his lip, his eyes wavering as he slowly looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One quick glance, and his heart nearly broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t even looking his way. Cedric showed up with a small plate of roasted ribs and set it in front of her,smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up in surprise as Cedric held out a piece of rib to her lips, his smile soft and inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where Alexander sat, he could see Daniela&#39;s lips part to take the piece of meat, with Cedric&#39;s fingers brushing her lips in the briefest touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, her eyes lighting up, as her lips brushed against Cedric&#39;s fingertips, over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, known for his cold and distant reputation,was full of smiles and warmth that no one could have predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his fists, his heart aching so much it felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every mnoment, every touch, should have been his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric had cruelly taken it all away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric weren&#39;t in the picture, Alexander was sure everything would&#39;ve been different. Daniela would&#39;ve changed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of everyone&#39;s gaze made Alexander&#39;s chest feel heavy, and he couldn&#39;t shake the rage burning inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in his eyes left everyone stunned, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, observing from the sidelines, grasped the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snorted derisively, her voice laced with mockery.&#34;Stop fantasizing. You&#39;re no longer part of her life. If she truly cared, do you think your struggling company would still require you to exhaust yourself trying to fix it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce crushed every last bit of hope Alexander had His fists, once clenched tight, loosened, and his anger drained away as he lowered his gaze. With a heavy heart,heresumed peeling the shrimp, his movements stiff and automatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smiled faintly, exchanging a brief, distant look with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned away, and Joyce chose not to approach,unwilling to ruin her own mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the banquet neared its conclusion, Katrina stepped forward to speak with Joyce once more. &#34;Joyce, I regret everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Katrina had expressed regret before, this time,her remorse was unmistakably sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce,I&#39;ll find a way to get some money. Let&#39;s leave and start fresh somewhere no one knows us. I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong values, the wrong upbringing, and that&#39;s how you became who you are.If I could go back, I wouldn&#39;t take any shortcuts. I&#39;d raise you right-raise you to be the most incredible girl in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce blinked, pulling at her lips in a faint smile. &#34;Mom,let&#39;s not dwell on the past. It&#39;s pointless. We should focus on living well now.&#34; And with that, she turned and walked away without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stayed frozen in place, her eyes following Joyce until she disappeared down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she typed out a message to Joyce.&#34;Joyce,I really loved your yellow bag when we had coffee last time.Could you let me borrow it next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute after sending the message, Katrina felt the cold press of a dagger against her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her face as she realized what was happening. She had known this day would come,but she hadn&#39;t expected it to be so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision started to fade, and her body gave out,collapsing weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hear the panicked screams of those around her and the warmth of blood flowing quickly from an unseen wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling, she managed to crack open her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she thought she saw Joyce rushing towards her-her only daughter, the one she loved more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom? What happened? Mom, please! Help! Is there a doctor here? Someone, please help me!&#34; Katrina&#39;s consciousness slowly slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her final moments, all she could hear were the heavy footsteps. She forced her eyes open and saw Caiden standing outside the crowd-the man who had once propelled her to the heights of success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood at a distance, his gaze cold and indifferent as it locked with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made no move to approach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she weakly raised her hand towards him, he spat on the ground with utter disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Katrina&#39;s fragile spirit broke beyond repair.</p>
