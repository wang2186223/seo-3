                <p>As Cedric came down the stairs, something felt off. His gaze landed on Brad, who was lounging in the living room, right in Daniela&#39;s favorite spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he noticed the apple Brad was casually holding, and his brows pulled tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, sensing Cedric&#39;s focus on the fruit, gave a quick explanation. &#34;The housekeeper got it from a different fridge,not Daniela&#39;s usual one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew that had to be true. Daniela didn&#39;t like apples, and she never kept any in her personal fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what really bothered Cedric wasn&#39;t the apple. It was the fact that Brad had been in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, when Cedric made his way there himself, the housekeeper gave him the full story.&#34;The apple Mr.McCoy was holding came from the secondary fridge. I told him the pomegranates were prepared specially for Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused as he opened the fridge. &#34;He opened this fridge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his voice was calm, his expression had gone cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, who knew all too well how much Cedric doted on Daniela and how he personally handled even her food, felt a spike of nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly added, &#34;Yes, sir. But I stopped him before he touched anything inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a short nod.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper noticed the pomegranates prepared for Daniela that day were freshly picked by Cedric from the tree outside the villa. He also threw out every fruit from the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling uneasy, the housekeeper promised before leaving, &#34;I swear, I won&#39;t let anyone into the kitchen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the dim evening light, Cedric&#39;s sharp features seemed even more unforgiving. His voice was low and cold.&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the very next day, as soon as her back was turned, Brad slipped into the kitchen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, the housekeeper immediately approached him. &#34;Mr. McCoy, I&#39;m sorry, but Mr. Phillps said yesterday the kitchen is off-limits to guests. If you&#39;re hungry or need anything, just let me know, andI&#39;l bring it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad smiled and pointed at Daniela&#39;s private fridge. &#34;I noticed there were some peaches in there yesterday.Where&#39;d they go? Looks like Daniela&#39;s quite the fruit enthusiast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper didn&#39;t know how to tell him those peaches, and everything else, had been thrown out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chuckled and walked away, muttering under his breath, &#34;Cedric really is one cautious guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t realize was that someone had been watching him from the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton entered through the front door just in time to catch Cedric&#39;s icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the fruit in Brad&#39;s hand, and Hamilton immediately pieced it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed to Cedric&#39;s side and whispered,&#34;I&#39;ll take care of it. Brad is still your uncle. No matter what,we can&#39;t take it that far. I&#39;ll make sure he&#39;s removed from the house. And don&#39;t worry-l&#39;ve already brought in more security. Daniela will be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything, Hamilton still held on to the bond they shared as brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out by today,&#34; Cedric said sharply, leaving no room for negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded quickly. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he was told to leave, Brad barked, &#34;You&#39;re kicking me out? Why? I&#39;ve already made myself comfortable here. Now you want to throw me out like trash? Where the hell am I supposed to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sighed, keeping his voice calm. He pulled out a wad of cash and placed it on the table. &#34;There are plenty of hotels. Take your pick. Daniela&#39;s pregnant now, and this isn&#39;t a place for guests anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t budge. He stayed planted on the.bed, arms crossed. &#34;This villa is huge. There are more than enough rooms. What&#39;s the big deal if I stay a bit longer? Since when did you get so stingy,Hamilton? And by the way, I haven&#39;t even written that so-called confession to Daniela. You think she&#39;ll just let me leave without it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was clinging to the confession like it was his golden ticket, a tool to regain leverage over Daniela.In his mind,justice and fairness were now in his hands, and he had the power to grant or withhold it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was trying to stay composed, but Brad&#39;s attitude was starting to wear him down. &#34;You were never going to write that confession,were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t respond. He kept his eyes low, silently tugging at a loose thread on his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice turned stern. &#34;You can see for yourself-Cedric and Daniela aren&#39;t pushovers. I&#39;m still trying to treat you like a brother by giving you a chance. Leave now while you still can. You&#39;re not gong to win against them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a sharp laugh, brushing off the warning. To him, Daniela was just a fragile woman carrying twins.No matter how fierce her past was as a mercenary leader, pregnancy made her vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a voice full of bitterness, Brad said, &#34;If you really cared about our bond, you&#39;d be taking my side. But instead, you&#39;re letting Daniela run wild. She&#39;s trying to crush us, Hamilton. You want me to write some pathetic letter of confession? Maybe in my next life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at him, exhausted and disappointed. &#34;AIright. If that&#39;s how you feel, I&#39;ve got nothing left to say. Can&#39;t help someone who&#39;s set on digging their own grave. Do whatever you want. I&#39;mout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out of the room, Brad let out a loud, bitter scoff that echoed down the hallway.</p>
