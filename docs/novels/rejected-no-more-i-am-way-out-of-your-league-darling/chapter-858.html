                <p>Daniela descended the stairs to find the others gathered, each of them holding their breath as she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up a glass, taking an unhurried sip while their anxious gazes tracked her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol broke the silence, her voice tinged with concern.&#34;Daniela, are you really alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before,whenever Daniela had needed to act on short notice, she&#39;d relied on tranquilizer. She had never seen Daniela in such a state before. She was quite worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Slept well and feel even better,&#34; Daniela replied, her tone calm and sure. Last night, she and Cedric had been together twice, and the memory only bolstered her spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s words echoed in her mind-they were a couple. She could do as she pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s sharp eyes lingered on Daniela&#39;s glowing complexion, a far cry from her ghostly pallor the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck her that Daniela probably arrived in the world already perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast wrapped up,Carol leaned in,lowering her voice. &#34;Cedric&#39;s already dealt with Alexander.What&#39;s our next move? Cedric said he&#39;ll take care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they heard this, the McCoy brothers exchanged uneasy glances, tension etched across their faces. Both sets of eyes drifted to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Let Cedric handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stepped forward, his tone earnest. &#34;Daniela, do you know what Cedric did to Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Daniela locked eyes with him. &#34;We&#39;re not the type to sit back and let ourselves be pushed around.Whatever Cedric decides, he has every right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made it clear-Cedric would take matters into his own hands, and she wouldn&#39;t stand in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon seemed unsurprised by her answer. &#34;And McCoy Group? Are you seriously planning to deal wwith it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was sure the explosion and her mother&#39;s death were tied to McCoy Group. She couldn&#39;t turn a blind eye any longer. There was no other reason they&#39;d be in Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not here for a vacation,&#34; she said, her voice unwavering. &#34;Both of you are McCoys. If you want to go back home, I won&#39;t stop you. If you choose to remain neutral, I&#39;ll keep you out of it. The decision&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been relaxed, never one to force anyone&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered them the freedom to make their own choice, then walked away, leaving the weight of the decision behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon exchanged a look with Nikolas. &#34;I&#39;m not heading back, Nikolas. I&#39;m with Daniela on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avenging her mother and her unborn child-she was absolutely right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas slipped away to his room, his voice calm but resolute. &#34;I&#39;m no longer a McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everything now in Cedric&#39;s hands, Daniela stepped back. She refused to meddle, and Carol respected her silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric worked late, his attention glued to his laptop.Sometimes, Daniela caught herself peeking at his screen out of idle curiosity. He never bothered to hide anything, and she never pressed for details. A few days later, justbefore a board meeting,whispers stirred in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear? Cedric is acting like a whole different person. It&#39;s actually scary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He used to be so mild-mannered, but now his temper&#39;s legendary. He&#39;s already sabotaged several McCoy Group&#39;s deals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ever since his wife&#39;s accident, he&#39;s been in a constant bad mood-unless she&#39;s around. Then he&#39;s all patience.But with anyone else? He&#39;s ready to tearthem apart.I&#39;ve seen it myself. Daniela is no ordinary woman,and neither is Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? Just look at Hamilton&#39;s face at those recent McCoy Group press conferences. He looks like he&#39;s about to bite right through his fingertips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I doubt Hamilton ever thought anyone would throw down the gauntlet and treat their billions like loose change. He must feel like he&#39;s been publicly humiliated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation hummed around Daniela, who listened quietly, arching an eyebrow at the swirl of speculation. Carol leaned over. &#34;Cedric&#39;s been absolutely relentless lately.&#34; That day, an unexpected guest arrived. Richard, whom they hadn&#39;t seen in ages, strode in with a heavy,urgent expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m here to take Alexander away. All he wants is tosee you one last time. I know the past is a tangled mess, but Cedric went too far. Yes,Alexander was wrong, but he doesn&#39;t deserve this ending. Please,Daniela. He&#39;s completely broken. He needs to see you -just this once. I&#39;m begging you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked down Richard&#39;s face as he pleaded,desperation cracking through his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was cool and unreadable, her posture perfectly steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you won&#39;t go to him, I&#39;ll have to bring him to you.You wouldn&#39;t want a scene in your own company,would you? I swear, see him this one time and we&#39;ll never disturb you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stagggered under the weight of his emotions,nearly collapsing right there in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the hospital room, Alexander lay swathed in bandages, barely recognizable beneath layers of gauze and splints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant he saw Daniela walk in, tears welled in his eyes, streaming down his ruined face. &#34;I heard you wanted to see me.&#34; Daniela halted at the foot of his bed, her expression unyielding. &#34;I didn&#39;t come here out of kindness. I came to finish what l started. After today,you and I will never cross paths again. I never loved you. Back when I said I liked you,that was the extent of it. Our divorce didn&#39;t change me, not even a little. Cedric showed me what love actually feels like. Real love isn&#39;t one-sided obsession -it&#39;s trust, desire, fulfillment. It&#39;s physical, emotional,complete. I never had any of that with you. You chose your own fate the moment you cornered me on that rooftop. You brought this on yourself. There&#39;s nothing left to say between us. I hope you spend the rest of your days remembering what you lost, and drowning in that regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on her heel, already moving for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Alexander&#39;s lips trembled. His voice rasped out, desperate. &#34;Did you ever love me at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, glancing over her shoulder with a laugh-quiet and merciless. &#34;Love you? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humiliation hit Alexander like a tidal wave. As Daniela strode out of the room without another look,Alexander&#39;s world spun out-his rage and heartbreak crashing together until darkness swallowed him whole.</p>
