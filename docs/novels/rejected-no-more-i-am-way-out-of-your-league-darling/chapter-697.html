                <p>Daniela stayed composed. She gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen sat down beside her as Tasha placed a glass of water on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Nikolas, Kohen had an easy way about him.His smile was calm, and he spoke without any tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t the slightest hint of hesitation on his part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Daniela and smiled. &#34;Daniela, is Cedric still working these days? As a McCoy, why is he still working himself so hard? He&#39;s gone through enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spent years on his own. I&#39;m sure life hasn&#39;t been kind to him. I believe once our father meet him, he&#39;ll make it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t react, and Kohen didn&#39;t seem to mind He kept his warm smile and continued, &#34;I see Cedric as my brother. Just because we were apart doesn&#39;t mean we should stay distant. Whatever happened before, we should let it go,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hadn&#39;t expected her to answer-but she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not Cedric. I don&#39;t know what he went through,so I won&#39;t speak for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Kohen off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Nikolas with a surprised look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he gave a small laugh. &#34;I heard before I got here that Cedric listens to you. Whatever you say, he does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t blink. Her voice stayed flat. &#34;I don&#39;t get involved in his choices. But I won&#39;t let anyone upset him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen opened his mouth to reply, but Daniela cut him off. &#34;I won&#39;t sugarcoat anything. I protect who l care about. So if anyone tries to hurt Cedric, don&#39;t expect me to play nice.&#34;  Kohen was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never met someone who brushed off social niceties like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a stiff chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sitting there a bit longer, he left with Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While walking through the garden, Kohen leaned closer and asked, &#34;She&#39;s got a nasty temper, doesn&#39;t she? Seems like she&#39;s not easy to trick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a slow breath and shut his eyes for a moment. &#34;Exactly why I wanted you to meet her yourself. Daniela&#39;s rich, and she doesn&#39;t play around.You need to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen snorted. &#34;You&#39;re blowing this out of proportion. She&#39;s just a woman. And no matter what Cedric&#39;s capable of, he&#39;s still no match for us.They&#39;re are inexperienced and naive. They&#39;lI never get a slice of the inheritance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as the last word left his lips, a black car rolled into the yard. Nikolas leaned toward Kohen and whispered,&#34;Cedric&#39;s back. Be careful with your words. He&#39;s not as easy to figure out as you thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Kohen had ever seen Cedric in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Oiscoll knew the McCoy brothers had good looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed to carry the best of those traits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only flaw was the slight limp in his step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That detail dulled some of Kohen&#39;s admiration,though the envy still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a friendly grin, he called out, &#34;Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t know who he was, but the resemblance to Nikolas was enough to guess they were related.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression didn&#39;t soften.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood firm at the villa&#39;s entrance, blocking their path. Kohen blinked, confused. &#34;Cedric, what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked between them. &#34;You tell me. What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Tasha&#39;s voice rang out from inside,calling everyone in for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Niklaus knew Cedric cared most about Daniela, so he quickly suggested, &#34;Why don&#39;t we go inside?Daniela&#39;s waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows furrowed just as the front door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood there and said, &#34;Come in for dinner first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had spent the day in Kaloria for a business meeting. She didn&#39;t want him dealing with them on an empty stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Cedric walked in. The other two followed behind him. &#34;Cedric, why are you still living here with Daniela?Phillips Group is doing fine. Why not just get your own place?&#34; Kohen pulled out a chair and sat down.&#34;If money&#39;s tight, I&#39;ll talk to Dad. He can get you a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he shot a glance toward Daniela.Her expression didn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured that unless Cedric&#39;s safety was involved,she wouldn&#39;t speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Cedric, Kohen smiled again. &#34;Or maybe there&#39;s a style you like? Tell me what kind of villa you want. I&#39;ll buy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he handed over the keys, Cedric would be stuck in this city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And by taking the gift, Cedric would be too ashamed to make demands of the McCoy family later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the family&#39;s assets would stay in their control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where Kohen sat, Cedric looked like nothing more than an average businessman. No ambition. No vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting him a villa seemed more than generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At best, Kohen figured, he might spring for a luxury one.</p>
