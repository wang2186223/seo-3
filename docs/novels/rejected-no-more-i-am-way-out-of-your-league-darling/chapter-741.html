                <p>Daniela stayed quiet for a long moment, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;No matter how things turn out, whether or not you get the answers you&#39;re chasing, as long as Cedric accepts me as his father,a part of the McCoy fortune will be his. It&#39;s a risk-free deal. Daniela, you should know which path to choose. And as Cedric&#39;s wife, don&#39;t you want to see him make his mark in the business world, instead of wasting his days in the kitchen like some housewife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t sure if it was just his imagination,but as he finished speaking, he thought he caught a flash of deadly rage burning in Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver slid down Hamilton&#39;s spine. &#34;What?&#34; he asked, feeling uneasy. &#34;Did I say something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice turned sharp as ice. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton retorted, &#34;You think it&#39;s a good thing for him to be trapped in a kitchen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded calmly, &#34;Whether it&#39;s good or bad depends on whether he&#39;s happy. What others think means nothing to me, and it shouldn&#39;t matter to him either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton bristled at Daniela&#39;s firm stance. &#34;So, you&#39;re telling me you won&#39;t persuade him to come back to the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she met Hamilton, Daniela had been unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never known a perfect family herself, so she wished Cedric could have one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dreamed of Cedric having parents, siblings,and someone he loved at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had wished for him a life filed with success and comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after meeting the McCoy family, she knew her answer. &#34;I won&#39;t try to convince him,&#34; she said,her voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;You&#39;re willing to walk away fromn all that money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one hates money,&#34; Daniela said evenly. &#34;But every fortune comes with a price. Accepting the McCoy family&#39;s wealth would mean Cedric severing ties with everything he once was. It means throwing away his pride just to live under your thumb-watching your every mood, serving you like a servant while you dine. To me, that&#39;s not love at all-it&#39;s nothing but control. I won&#39;t allow my partner to bow to anyone for the sake of money. He has his own pride and self-worth.When he was just a child, with no one to lean on, he fought to pave his own way.Now that he has me, he doesn&#39;t need to bow to anyone for wealth. He&#39;s free to live as he pleases,and no one has the right to stand in his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spoke with a calmness that only sharpened the weight of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton locked eyes with her impassive face. &#34;You really think you can keep him safe?&#34; His words thickened the air, pulling the room into a stifling silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her eyes, catching sight of the army of mercenaries stationed outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leisurely lifted his cup, his voice dripping with authority. &#34;Daniela, this is not your homeland.This is Oiscoll-a country | carved out with my own two hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton fully expected Daniela&#39;s composure to crack after hearing that. He waited for fear to flicker in her eyes. He imagined she&#39;d finally grasp the weight of his words and tread carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his shock, Daniela stayed even calmer than him. She lifted her cup, took a slow sip, placed it down, and smiled-a cool, effortless confidence in her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re certainly impressive. But would you like to find out if your mercenaries draw their blades faster -or if my trigger finger is quicker?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left her mouth than the icy barrel of a black gun touched Hamilton&#39;s temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary standing nearby froze, his face draining of color. &#34;Oh no, Ms. Harper! Please, don&#39;t be upset! Mr. McCoy was only joking! Your husband is his son-he wouldn&#39;t harm him! You&#39;re all family here. It was just a harmless joke! Please don&#39;t take it to heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary had turned ghostly pale, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat there, the picture of unshakable calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, still seated opposite her, regarded Daniela with a cold, assessing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had anyone dared press a gun to his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela saw right through his fury and smiled. &#34;Well,this is no joke. And just so we&#39;re clear-I don&#39;t find jokes funny. Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept the gun steady and added coolly, &#34;I don&#39;t care what Cedric chooses later. But from this moment on, if even a hair on his head is harmed, I&#39;l come for you, McCoy Group, and every last person tied to your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary trembled like a leaf. &#34;Ms. Harper,why are you being so unreasonable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela locked eyes with Hamilton, neither side willing to blink first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela ever stood against him, she would be a force even he would fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she stood with his heir, she would become the sharpest weapon in his arsenal, capable of wiping out anything that stood in their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all the men in the McCoy family, not a single one could match Daniela&#39;s iron will and fearless spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slowly nudged the barrel away from his temple with two fingers before finally speaking. &#34;No need to get so heated. He&#39;s my son; I would never harm him. Daniela, I see your stance clearly. Solet me ask you-what if Cedric chose to come back to the McCoy family on his own?&#34;</p>
