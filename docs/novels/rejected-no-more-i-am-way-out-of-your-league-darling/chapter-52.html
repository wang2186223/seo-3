                <p>As Jerry Oliver took the lead with the group in tow,their footsteps reverberated through the corridor,accompanied by a low murmur of whispers that filled the air with a sense of unease.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, gripping the vase, struggled to maintain her composure. A pulsing headache exacerbated her growing irritation, yet she managed to suppress the rising storm within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back to check on her daughter, only to see her engaged in light-hearted conversation with a friend, seemingly oblivious to the tension around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep breath, Katrina tightened her eyes shut,mentally coaxing herself to remain calm and not to succumb to the provocation of the youngsters&#39;carefree disregard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator moved down through the floors,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s previously easy smile slowly dissolved into a look of concern. A troubling premonition gnawed at him, prompting him to finally break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jerry, just where on earth are we headed now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had exited the elevator and continued their lengthy trek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed as if they were about to leave the confines of Luxor Tower altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry, clutching a hefty ring of keys, was visibly annoyed. The murmurs and snickers from the group had not escaped his notice and had left him simmering with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was keenly aware of Daniela&#39;s true character-her beauty was matched by her compassion and generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had discreetly funded his wife&#39;s surgery when they were desperate and unsupported. Whenever a crisis struck a staff member&#39;s family, she was there to offer aid. Her genuine kindness had earned her the  deep respect of everyone within Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, here was her own family, disparaging her with a haughty air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry rolled his eyes, his voice sharp and dismissive as he retorted, &#34;Why bombard me with questions?Just come along and all will be revealed in due time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brusque tone took Caiden aback. It had been a long while since someone had addressed him with such unfiltered disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not know who the hell I am?&#34; Caiden challenged, his brow furrowed in irritation. &#34;I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s father-your boss&#39;s father! With a snap of my fingers, I could own this entire building!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry halted in his tracks, his grip on the keys tightening, his knuckles whitening as he fought to control his rising fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, seemingly unaware of the growing storm,pressed on. &#34;Don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s my family&#39;s money keeping your ass employed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, quick to capitalize on the moment, chimed in sharply, &#34;Precisely! Would you even have a job if it weren&#39;t for us? People who run their damn mouths like you don&#39;t deserve to stay employed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry exhaled sharply, his voice laced with a mix of defiance and disbelief. &#34;Go ahead, fire me! But I have to ask, do you actually hold the power to do so?Caiden, is it? Let me make something clear. Having you as a father is the worst curse that could&#39;ve befallen Ms. Harper! Weren&#39;t you the one who declared to the world that you were severing all ties with her? And yet, now that she&#39;s found success, you suddenly claim ownership over this entire building?Why not take it further? Perhaps proclaim that the entire nation belongs to you? You&#39;re supposed to be an elder-perhaps it&#39;s time to start behaving like one and exhibit a bit of dignity!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face flushed a deep crimson, and she shook with fury. &#34;How dare you speak to us in such a manner! Get your manager on the phone this instant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry, utterly unfazed by the escalating tension,retrieved his phone and dialed his manager,putting the call on speaker. The manager&#39;s voice crackled through, tinged with irritation. &#34;What now? What&#39;s the problem with Joyce Holt? She&#39;s already stirred up enough trouble. You know what? Forget it-if they&#39;re that much of a nuisance, just stop leasing to them. Are we really so desperate that we can&#39;t do without the rent from a basement-level unit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrase &#34;basement-level unit&#34; struck a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Katrina, who had been simmering with rage only seconds before, came to a sudden halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s brow furrowed as her voice dripped with fury. &#34;What the hell do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry folded his arms, his voice laced with a flat,impatient tone. &#34;Areyou coming to check it out or not? If you&#39;re not interested, I can just go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, the trio stifled their objections and trailed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved deeper, an unsettling feeling crept up on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce edged closer to Katrina, her voice a nervous whisper. &#34;Mom, what is this place? Why are we wandering through a parking garage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face grew troubled, her anxiety palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were supposed to be shown the 18th to 20th floors, yet here they were, in the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they progressed, Caiden&#39;s prior cockiness had vanished entirely, his face clouding over with each step they took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Joyce perked up, her voice slicing through the tension. &#34;Mom, look! There are shops over there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes collectively turned to where Joyce directed, and sure enough, a series of storefronts came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gestured towards a shop in the middle. &#34;If it&#39;s a spot like that, I could definitely see us there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Katrina&#39;s response was less than enthusiastic. Her experience of the opulent upper levels had set a high bar that this basement level couldn&#39;t meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disdainfully, she waved a dismissive hand, her nose wrinkling at the pervasive, musty odor that filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Jerry maintained his brisk pace, guiding them deeper into the busier part of the basement.They navigated a corner and halted abruptly at the end of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked around, bewildered. &#34;Seriously? You brought us to a damn restroom? We don&#39;t need to use it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry pointed to a dimly lit area near the bathroom and announced, &#34;Over there is the space for your shop.&#34; He then proceeded to unlock the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once opened, the room was engulfed in darkness, an eerie silence pervading the air. Joyce paused,reluctant, before finally using her phone&#39;s flashlight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to pierce the gloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight that greeted her elicited a shriek of terror.&#34;Mom! It&#39;s full of rats!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos exploded, their screams and yells bouncing off the waIls of the tight hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry, unimpressed, merely rolled his eyes. &#34;This area was once used for storing restroom supplies. It&#39;s been out of use for quite some time, hence the dust and, unfortunately, the current residents. The space is roughly 100 square meters, priced at $11,000 per square meter. That&#39;s the final offer, and you&#39;ll have to handle any renovations yourself. Make your decision today, or it&#39;s no longer available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were left dumbfounded, struggling to comprehend his proposition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s forced smile faded as she turned to Caiden,her expression one of sheer outrage. &#34;Don&#39;t you see it? Daniela&#39;s doing this on purpose to make us look like fools, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke down, tears streaming down her face, her hands covering her eyes as she sobbed uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s friends had discreetly vanished, leaving only a few behind who observed the unfolding drama with a mix of amusement and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips trembled as she clutched Caiden&#39;s arm,her tear-filled eyes wide with despair. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve never been so humiliated in my life! How can l possibly face my friends after this? Daniela set the whole thing up. She&#39;s obsessed with tearing me down and making me a joke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, some bystanders discreetly extracted their phones to capture the family&#39;s distress,quickly taking pictures before vanishing into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry, apparently oblivious to the unfolding drama,picked up an incoming call. He spoke in a booming voice, not bothering to lower his tone, ensuring that Caiden and Katrina caught every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Yes, I&#39;m terribly sorry about the holdup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>understand we agreed to reserve the space next to the restroom for your cleaning supplies store, but there&#39;s been a bit of a scene here. You know how Ms.Harper is always kind-hearted. She insisted we let them have a look first. But I wouldn&#39;t worry-they&#39;re notoriously fussy. Give me half an hour.If they pass on it, I&#39;ll ring you straight back and we can finalize the paperwork. Alright, appreciate your patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Jerry swiveled back to face the group, his voice edged with impatience. &#34;Are you interested in the space or not? If you&#39;re not,there are plenty of others waiting in line for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, her face streaked with tears, looked imploringly at Caiden and Katrina.</p>
