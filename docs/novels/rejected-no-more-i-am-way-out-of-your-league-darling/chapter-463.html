                <p>Elyse tilted her head, a brief frown creasing her face before quickly composing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here,&#34; Elyse murmured,pointing to the mirror&#39;s faint reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Daniela tie up Linden? Who would&#39;ve guessed she had such a wild side?&#34; Elyse sneered,a mocking smile Curling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was dimly lit, with shadowy figures appearing blurred and indistinct in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie strained to see more clearly, but the figures in the mirror flickered and faded,disappearing without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,do you think something might go wrong?&#34;Natalie asked, her voice tinged with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent considerable time with Daniela recently and genuinely sensed that Daniela was far from an ordinary person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse waved off her concern with a dismissive shrug.&#34;What could go wrong?Daniela&#39;s been hypnotized.I saw her myself,sprawled across Linden&#39;s bed. When I left, he was already on top of her.How could that possibly be fake?&#34; Natalie frowned. &#34;And Daniela didn&#39;t react at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled and said, &#34;What reaction could she possibly have? I had to sell everything I owned just to afford that expensive hypnotist, all to ensure our plan went smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glanced at the security feed, eyes narrowing at the empty room displayed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop obsessing over that. The camera angle is limited.They&#39;re probably tucked away in a corner somewhere.&#34;Elyse&#39;s laugh was sharp, edged with something brittle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a careless flick of her hand, she ordered an expensive bottle of wine she couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Natalie. This might take a while. Why deny ourselves a little luxury? This bottle costs over eight hundred grand.I&#39;ve been dyingto try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse signaled the waiter to uncork the bottle,but Natalie reached out stopping him. She advised, &#34;Mom.maybe we shouldn&#39;t rush to celebrate just yet. If something goes wrong, we won&#39;t even be able to pay for this wine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They barely had eighty thousand left, let alone eight hundred thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell had been breathing down their necks,demanding the rest of his payment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of an empty wallet had become all too tomiliar to Natalie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse scoffed,prying Natalie&#39;s hand from the waiter&#39;s arm.&#34;Open it,&#34; she snapped, then ordered a round of overpriced steaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she dug into her meal,Elyse spoke through bites.&#34;Life&#39;s too short so we should indulge in the finer things.Once Linden&#39;s done, I&#39;ll have him kill Daniela.After that,everything she owns will be ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;I&#39;m just worried Linden might not have the guts to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse threw her head back, laughing. &#34;Oh, he will. He knows the consequences if he doesn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on her daughter,noting the striking resemblance to Daniela. &#34;And when Cedric&#39;s heart shatters over losing his beloved wifa, he&#39;ll marry you Before long. Daniela&#39;s and Cedric&#39;s fortunes will be yours.You&#39;ll have everything you ever dreamed ofl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was brimming with dreams of what the future held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s tension eased, a smile slowly spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, reporters invited to the hotel to take photos arrived early, their cameras slung over their shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse welcomed them with lavish hospitality.pouring fine wine like it grew on trees.  courteously interviewed Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Dury, can you confirm if your information is accurate? Is Daniela truly cheating on Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded solemnly, feigning regret. &#34;I couldn&#39;t believe it myself at first. A close friend, an executive here, saw it firsthand and told me. It&#39;s unfortunate for the family. But I suppose it&#39;s understandable. Daniela lost her mother at a young age, grew up without parental guidance, and endured long-term abuse from her stepmother, Katrina. It&#39;s no wonder her way of thinking is so different from most people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Á bespectacled reporter leaned forward, eyeing Elyse intently.&#34;I&#39;ve heard Daniela&#39;s affair is with her family doctor.Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse sighed dramatically. &#34;Yes. I was the one who introduced the doctor to her. The guilt eats at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on her best sincere face. &#34;I didn&#39;t invite you here to spread rumors. Cheating is wrong and I hope Daniela realizes her mistake and mends her ways.I know you&#39;re all reporters, but please, I ask that you don&#39;t write anything misleading.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters exchanged knowing glances, nodding in agreement. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one reporter frowned. &#34;When I was at Elite Lux for an interview, I saw Linden. He looked particularly unappealing.Why would Daniela be interested in him?Is there more to this than you&#39;re letting on?&#34; Elyse&#39;s expression stiffened, but she quickly masked any sign of anger in front of the reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, she responded, &#34;There&#39;s no hidden story.They were constantly exchanging glances at the company. I couldn&#39;t even bear to watch them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter wasn&#39;t convinced. &#34;Considering Daniela&#39;s taste in men, I doubt she&#39;d fall for Linden. With her current status, finding a handsome man would be a breeze. So why him?&#34; The reporter pulled out his phone,showing a picture of Linden. &#34;Look, everyone,here&#39;s Linden. And this photo is clearly photoshopped.He looks uglier in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many of the reporters hadn&#39;t given Linden much thought before. Now, seeing the photo, they were all taken aback, their expressions filled with shock. &#34;Is this Linden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to Elyse, their eyes sharp with doubt.&#34;Ms. Dury, could you have made a mistake? Maybe they&#39;re just conducting business upstairs. Surely,Daniela wouldn&#39;t choose a man like that.&#34;</p>
