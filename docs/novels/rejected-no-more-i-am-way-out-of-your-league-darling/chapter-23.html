                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t say a word and simply pulled Joyce back into her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd,expecting more drama, let out a unified sigh of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Daniela secured the jade tiger for a whopping $19 million and handed it over to Lillian as a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, her face alight with glee, shot a smug look at Joyce,whose face was twisted with barely concealed fury. She then said in a loud voice, &#34;Thanks,Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was so enraged that veins popped from her forehead,her anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had once been nothing but a lovesick fool.Alexander had never wanted her. And now,just because she&#39;d become a high-powered CEO,she thought she could act superior?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the auction wrapped up, Daniela lingered to chat with the event organizer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking advantage of the situation, Joyce quickly lifted her phone and took a picture of Daniela. Turning to Alexander, she said, &#34;Alexander, look at her! Daniela has no shame. First, she was flirting with Cedric, and now she&#39;s all over the organizer, who&#39;s old enough to be her father. She&#39;s making a fool of the Harper family. And don&#39;t forget-she was your wife. Just think about the damage she&#39;s doing to your reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Joyce had angled the photo just right to make it look much worse than it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Daniela was just having a friendly chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Joyce quickly posted the photo in the Harper family group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, take a look at Daniela! The organizer is practically her father&#39;s age! How shameless is she? I don&#39;t care about her reputation, but mine is at stake.I&#39;ve never been so humiliated. How am I supposed to show my face in public now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she had hoped, her dramatics hit their mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s anger flared up, and he smashed another of his precious porcelain cups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the message, Joyce looked over at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was as stoic as ever, unreadable.Joyce couldn&#39;t tell if he was angry or just indifferent. &#34;Alexander, let&#39;s go,&#34; she said in a sugary tone, though her eyes quickly followed Daniela, who was walking to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then a sneaky idea flashed through her mind.After a brief pause, she added, &#34;Actually, Alexander,would you mind coming with me to the resroom?I&#39;m not feeling well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the restroom, Daniela was in the middle of freshening up her makeup when Joyce entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,well, Daniela. What a coincidence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even sparing her a glance, Daniela continued applying powder to her face, her voice calm and detached. &#34;You came in here on purpose. No need to play games, my dear sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last three words sliced through the air, sharp and piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no time for Joyce&#39;s dramatics-it made her stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, yes, I followed you. But what&#39;s so special about you,Daniela? So what if you&#39;ve got money now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped for a moment, a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth. She turned to Joyce,her voice calm as she corrected her. &#34;It&#39;s not just some money. It&#39;s a lot of money. And it&#39;s the kind of money you&#39;d never be able to earn in ten lifetimes. So go ahead and let yourself be jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s fury nearly made her choke.&#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about me?&#34; Daniela cut in, her voice cold,her eyes sharp. &#34;You still think I&#39;m that same easy target?Well, here&#39;s a tip-don&#39;t push me, or I&#39;ll have you out of the Harper family faster than you can blink!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes filled with tears as she pointed at Daniela.&#34;How could you! Dad says I&#39;m his daughter! You can&#39;t just kick me out! Daniela, you hate me, don&#39;t you?You&#39;re just jealous because Alexander likes me. But I&#39;m your sister. Why would I hurt you?&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she staggered back, almost as if shoved,crashing dramatically against the restroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Alexander stood leaning against the wall,a cigarette between his fingers. He observed as Joyce stumbled out of the restroom, her body collapsing onto the floor in a heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tilted her head back, her teary eyes wide with false innocence. She knew Alexander could see her like this, looking as pitiful as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at Daniela, her voice thick with complaint. &#34;Daniela, why are you doing this to me? I know you like Alexander, but he&#39;s my true love, too!Am I not allowed to love someone? Fine, it&#39;s all my fault. I&#39;ll kneel and beg if that&#39;s what you want!&#34; Her voice cracked, and her body shook as if she might collapse at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched Joyce&#39;s over-the-top performance with a calm, almost entertained look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes briefly moved to the doorway, where Alexander stood silently watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled and crossed her arms. &#34;Go on,kneel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze in place, her cries suddenly trailing off.She was thrown off, unsure of how to react to Daniela&#39;s unexpected response. &#34;What?&#34; she stammered, staring at Daniela in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, her gaze sharp. &#34;You said you&#39;d kneel, didn&#39;t you? So go ahead, kneel.What&#39;s the hold-up? Can&#39;t follow through? Was all that talk just for show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face turned red with embarrassment, her confidence slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander started to speak, but before he could say anything, Daniela&#39;s cold stare landed on him. &#34;She said she&#39;d kneel. You heard her, didn&#39;t you? I didn&#39;t make her say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady and unwavering. It was nothing like the gentle tone she used to have. &#34;This is a private matter between Joyce and me. You&#39;ve crossed the line, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
