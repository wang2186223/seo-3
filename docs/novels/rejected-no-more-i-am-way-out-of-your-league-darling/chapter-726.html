                <p>Daniela blinked, caught off guard by the unexpected question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol frowned slightly and slipped away without a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to Cedric, confusion etched across her face. &#34;Where exactly are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered with a grin, &#34;Oiscoll, obviously.We&#39;re going to fight for the inheritance, aren&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He beamed as he spoke, carefree and untouched by worry for what lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never set foot in Oiscoll, knew nothing of Hamilton or the tangled web of schemes spun within the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he had was trust in Daniela-and the unwavering belief that her path was his to walk too. No strategy, no pros and cons checklist-just a heart unburdened by doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the road ahead was wrapped in fog, he faced it without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes, wanting to tell her the truth,but in the end, she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, his grin as radiant and effortless as sunlight through glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight kissed his face, sharpening his striking features and casting him in a glow of quiet resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say the word when you&#39;re ready. I&#39;ll pack up and we&#39;ll go,&#34; Cedric said, then darted off toward his room, light-footed and eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood off to the side, a flicker of sympathy passing through her. In this home where she barely felt seen, her only prayer was that her son would grow up soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening in now and then on Cedric and Daniela, she often felt like little more than a machine, just going through the motions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Cedric&#39;s joy today stirred a quiet ache in her chest-she felt sorry for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, once upon a time, she had feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Daniela with a warning. &#34;If you leave him behind, it might break his heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot a glance in Joyce&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce went on, &#34;Sorry, I had to say it. I truly think it&#39;s alright for you to take him with you. Just because the past was messy doesn&#39;t mean the future has to be.Why make it harder than it needs to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted her gaze back to the TV. &#34;I&#39;m fine.He&#39;ll move on fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce studied Daniela&#39;s detached expression and let out a quiet sigh. &#34;Just make sure you won&#39;t regret it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared ahead, unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lowered her voice. &#34;Those who love hard can&#39;t stand being dumped. He may look soft, but he&#39;s not weak. If you really leave him, I&#39;m afraid when all this settles and you want to get back together with him,he might never come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Joyce added, &#34;A lot of people fool themselves into thinking they matter more than they do, but the world doesn&#39;t spin around anyone&#39;s ego.No one&#39;s going to wait around forever-especially/not when they&#39;ve been pushed aside on purpose. So think hard. Miss this shot, and you might never find someone who loves you the way Cedric does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left her mouth, Joyce caught sight of Cedric standing quietly at the top of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft sigh and fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her eyes on the TV, her face unreadable,but no one noticed a brief flicker in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Nikolas stormed in to confront Daniela, his voice sharp and brimming with anger.&#34;So you&#39;re really siding with Charles to take me down?&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, in no mood for a fight, shot back with cold irritation. &#34;Take you down? What makes you think you&#39;re even worth the effort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nearly exploded. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? The McCoy family is the richest on the planet and you dare act arrogant with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed him with an icy stare. &#34;It might be the richest family in the world, but don&#39;t kid yourself-you don&#39;t speak for them. I&#39;m certain your father,Hamilton, sees the value in what I bring to the table.I have every reason to be confident. What about you?What do you have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage swelled in Nikolas, but no words came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he spat, &#34;You can&#39;t do this! The McCoy legacy should be mine! If it weren&#39;t for you and Cedric, I&#39;d already have it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury crackled off him like static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t waste another breath. She turned and walked away. She had barely taken a few steps when Nikolas shouted after her, &#34;Whatever you want, name it! It&#39;s yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike his brothers, Nikolas spoke through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over her shoulder, a faint, chilling smile on her lips. &#34;Are you sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her tone made Nikolas shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to mean that Kohen and Charles had struck some major deal with her behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they offer you?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;They promised to find the culprit and make Cedric their successor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes went wide, disbelief crashing over him.&#34;No! That&#39;s impossible! That can&#39;t be true!&#34;</p>
