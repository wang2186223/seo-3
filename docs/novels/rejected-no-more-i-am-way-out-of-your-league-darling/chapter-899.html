                <p>The board members of McCoy Group acted swiftly. By nightfall, they went to see Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They waited until Daniela and Carol had departed before entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,they hadn&#39;t anticipated being halted by security personnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any clue who you&#39;re talking to? Who gave you the nerve to stop us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard remained composed. &#34;Your identity is irrelevant. Without clearance or prior notice, no one gets upstairs. Carol herself established this policy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen here!&#34; one of them barked, tugging at his cuffs. &#34;I don&#39;t take disrespect lightly! Are you even aware of who you&#39;re dealing with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard, unfazed, replied coolly, &#34;It changes nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re Cedric&#39;s relatives! Why would we need an invitation to meet our own kin?&#34; A McCoy relative jabbed a finger at his own face. &#34;One glance at me should be all the proof you need!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard pulled out his communication device. &#34;We&#39;ve got some people here pretending to be Mr. Phillips&#39;relatives.Please bring reinforcements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys stood there, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally processed what happened, their faces flushed with fury. One of them shouted, jabbing a finger, &#34;Excuse me? Repeat that! Who&#39;s pretending anything? We&#39;re the McCoys! This man&#39;s Cedric&#39;s second uncle, this one&#39;s the third, that&#39;s his aunt with her husband!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the chief of security appeared with a squad of officers and blocked the entry entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies. Entry is restricted to those with verified clearance. Furthermore, we&#39;ve spoken with Mr. Phillips. He denies having any McCoy relatives. Please act accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one claiming to be Cedric&#39;s eldest uncle exploded. As he opened his mouth to protest, Nikolas came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swarmed him at once. &#34;You need to help us! These idiots won&#39;t let us in. Set them straight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others quickly joined in, nodding and pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas examined both sides-the guards and the gathered family-before letting out a tired breath. &#34;This isn&#39;t my jurisdiction. They make the ruleshere.My hands are tied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group, just moments ago puffed up with confidence,blinked in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-what did you just say?&#34; one muttered, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, seriously? You&#39;re siding with outsiders while we&#39;re being shamed? Do you even consider yourself one of us anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swiped his badge and slipped through the automatic doors. Without glancing over his shoulder, he replied, &#34;Actually, no. My father already cut ties with me. You&#39;d be wise not to stir things up.Daniela will be back any minute, and she doesn&#39;t handle nonsense well. If she catches you harassing Cedric, she&#39;Il tear into you,and trust me-it&#39;ll sting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he vanished, leaving the McCoys seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eldest among them gave a sharp, bitter laugh. &#34;Hamilton&#39;s son turned out rotten. That man&#39;s a shame to the bloodline. And Daniela? We&#39;re supposed to be scared of her? Who does she think she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third uncle growled, &#34;Exactly! She acts high and mighty, but she&#39;s just some woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he said that than they noticed the guards&#39; expressions shift dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every officer snapped upright as one voice rang out: &#34;Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys turned-and there Daniela was, standing tall at the front entrance, wearing a composed smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Men who resort to using womanhood as a jab clearly have nothing stronger to offer,&#34; Daniela said smoothly as she sauntered forward. &#34;Now, let&#39;s see who considers themselves important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence blanketed the McCoy camp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from them, Daniela folded her arms. &#34;You want a word with my husband. He&#39;s occupied. If there&#39;s anything to discuss, say 社t to me.＂</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had come at this hour deliberately, hoping to avoid her. They knew Cedric was relentless when it came to business, and Daniela wouldn&#39;t loosen her grip on him. One of them muttered, &#34;We&#39;ve got nothing to talk about with you. We came for Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking they had finally won, the McCoys straightened up smugly-until she turned to the security chief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ensure the entrance is tightly secured. No one associated with the McCoys-or anyone sent on their behalf -gets in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head of security responded loudly, &#34;Understood!&#34;</p>
