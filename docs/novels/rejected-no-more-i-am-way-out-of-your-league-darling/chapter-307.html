                <p>Joyce was ruthless, but she lacked the cunning to play the game behind the scenes. Without hesitation, she admitted, &#34;Mom, I saw the message Grandma sent you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was caught off guard. &#34;And what if you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that the simplest answer?&#34; Joyce retorted. &#34;Grandma said Doug throws money around like it&#39;s nothing. He could give you a fortune. What&#39;s stopping you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot Katrina a quick look and continued, &#34;Doug didn&#39;t ask for a divorce. He just wants you to keep him company. Mom, that&#39;s one hundred million! And isn&#39;t dealing with men something you know all too well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt completely exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had the energy, she would have slapped Joyce across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her precious daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one she had loved with all her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you say something like that?&#34; Katrina felt her heart crack. She was filled with a deep sense of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she&#39;d been wondering if Daniela killed her, would Joyce step in to avenge her, as Daniela had done for her own mother?。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her heart ache with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was still so young and had to carry such a heavy weight of bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it turned out she had been fooling herself all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was nothing like Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Brylee had been too busy, hardly ever spending time with the five-year-old Daniela. But that young Daniela clung to her mother&#39;s memory with relentless devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina&#39;s own daughter-the one she had raised for over two decades-was now telling her to sleep with a stranger to settle her debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though her whole world was crumbling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, you&#39;re aware I&#39;m married, right? You&#39;ve called Caiden &#39;Dad&#39; for more than twenty years. How could you ask me to go along with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed by her mother&#39;s pain, Joyce responded casually, &#34;But didn&#39;t you do the same thing before? You cheated on my real dad with Caiden. I was young, sure, but I wasn&#39;t blind. The garden, the bathroom,the rooftop, the kitchen. Didn&#39;t you and Caiden sneak around in all those spots? How is this any different?Caiden wasn&#39;t even close to being as rich as Doug, was he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt a painful tightness grip her chest. &#34;Joyce, think about it. I asked you once how you&#39;d feel about Caiden becoming your new father, and you agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded. &#34;And now, I agree with Doug becoming the new father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt completely crushed. She had always seen Doug as a last resort, someone she could turn to only when all other options were exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, there had been some love between her and Caiden. But now, she faced the possibility of staying in her marriage while getting involved with another man purely for financial gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A decade ago, perhaps she could have. But after so many years of comfort, she wasn&#39;t willing to sacrifice her dignity like that anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked so hard to leave her past behind, and now it felt like she was slipping right back into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back against the headboard, Katrina sighed. &#34;Joyce, you just don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce narrowed her eyes. &#34;So, you&#39;re refusing to help me? You were willing to sneak around with Caiden for your own sake, but now you won&#39;t make a single sacrifice for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce threw the orange she had been holding onto the floor in frustration. &#34;Katrina, you brought me into this wortd. You&#39;re responsible for met You have to figure ouì á way to ciéa my hundred-milion debtr</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce stormed out of the hospital room witlrout a second grance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure Katrina would eventually turn to Doug</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when the debt oollectors arrived, Joyce feft à mlx of desperation and bolidness. Without hesitation, she knelt before them, pleading for just two more days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them, a man named Flash Dixon, leaned in and grabbed Joyce&#39;s chin wlth a sty grin. &#34;You know what&#39; :happen# you don&#39;t pay, right? Gotta admit, a young lady raised with money like you is a rare flnd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shuddered. &#34;I&#39;m from the Harper family. My dad might not have money, but I have a sister. She&#39;s filthy rch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flash ralsed an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.aIs that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s the true heir to the family, Brylee&#39;s biological daughter. She&#39;s stunning and wealthy: Forget about a hundred million.She could easily come up with billions. You should go after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flash listened closely, pressing his tongue to the side of his mouth. &#34;You&#39;re not lying, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still on her knees, Joyce nodded urgently. &#34;Completely truthful. Look it up now! lf l&#39;m lying, you can kill me right here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flash pulled out his phone. &#34;What&#39;s her name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela Harper.&#34;</p>
