                <p>Cedric passed the phone to Daniela, and she slipped it into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had questions in mind, but he hesitated, unsure of the repercussions of asking them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew Daniela wasn&#39;t one to revisit old relationships, but back then, she had no principles when it came to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was always the one in control, except when it involved Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to enter the banquet hall,Cedric stopped briefly and gently grasped Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held it for just a moment before letting go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to face him, her brow slightly furrowed. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Cedric pressed his lips together as he clenched his hand and unclenched it. After a brief pause, he smiled and shook his head. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. Just stick to juice. Drinking at night can be tough on your stomach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, her eyes twinkling like stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt his heart skip a beat, but he still hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian and Ryan pulled him to a quiet corner for a scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric! What were you thinking?&#34; Ryan crossed his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was frantic. &#34;Were you about to confess? You should&#39;ve just confessed already. How hard is it to say, &#39;I like you, and I&#39;m going to pursue you?&#39; It&#39;s not that difficult, is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan ran his hand through his hair. &#34;You said you&#39;d wait because Daniela had just returned. Then you said the North District project was urgent, so you&#39;d wait again. What now? Are you going to wait until the project of the South and East Districts is finished?&#34; It was unusual for Ryan to speak this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian remarked, &#34;Look at this, you&#39;ve even got the quiet one talking. Cedric, what do you really want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned against the wall, his eyes focused on Daniela as she stood nearby, enjoying a cupcake,all while looking out through the large window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shy individual approached her with a drink, and Daniela offered a warm smile, completely unbothered by the cutthroat atmosphere that usually surrounded business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not ready yet,&#34; Cedric murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready for what? Look at this...&#34; Lillian started,but her words trailed off as Alexander emerged from the restroom, walking towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning,Cedric started to move towards them, but Lillian quickly held him back. He glanced at her in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother. You won&#39;t get it, even if you try. Just watch and learn,&#34; Lillian advised as Ryan held Cedric in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person Daniela was chatting with was a young interior designer, someone Alexander recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came from a humble, rural background with no connections, relying only on his determination to get ahead. The last time he offered Alexander a drink,Alexander took a small sip without much thought,while the young man downed the entire glass in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Alexander had seen the young man vomiting in the restroom, his girlfriend helping him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girlfriend was simple in appearance and modestly dressed, and she smiled at Alexander as she helped the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had witnessed many couples like them-staying together through the toughest times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down on people like them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Alexander reached Daniela, the young man seemed visibly nervous. Daniela glanced at him briefly, her tone neutral. &#34;Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander carried himself with the confidence of someone who had made it, and the young man,feeling defeated, handed Daniela his business card before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave the card a quick look-Leandro Prescott, an interior designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your time,&#34; Alexander said, snatching the card from her hand before she could read it.&#34;He&#39;s just a nobody with little to offer. If you need a real expert, come to Bennett Group. I&#39;ll introduce you to someone with over ten years of experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a casual motion, he threw the card into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;He gave that card to me. What gives you the right to make decisions on my behalf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brow furrowed, his expression barely controlled. &#34;I&#39;m just looking out for you.&#34; Daniela&#39;s face twisted into a look of distaste, and Alexander trailed behind her, asking, &#34;Why don&#39;t you believe I&#39;m looking out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela coolly sipped her juice, her eyes glancing at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These events might be dull, but they&#39;re great for making connections,&#34; Alexander continued. &#34;If you&#39;re not having fun, we can go somewhere better afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent, too disinterested to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander caught the resistance in her eyes,tightened his lips, and fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat on the couch, letting time pass by.With Alexander looming nearby, like a dark cloud, no one dared come near her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to get up and leave,Alexander spoke up. &#34;Look, Leandro&#39;s girlfriend is picking him up again. They look so close now, but he&#39;ll dump her the first thing when the money starts rolling in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leandro was being helped into a car by a slightly chubby woman in a black dress. She shut the door and quickly made her way to the driver&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That woman is so ordinary. Apart from being strong,I can&#39;t think of anything else that stands out about her. Daniela, you know why men go for practical women when they&#39;re building something? It&#39;s because only those kinds of women will stick with you when times get tough. Trust me, with Leandro&#39;s ambition, it won&#39;t take long before he moves on to a new girlfriend,&#34; Alexander said with a smug smile.&#34;I&#39;ve never been wrong about people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at him briefly before breaking into a smile, her expression carrying a hint of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sensed it wasn&#39;t a compliment, but his curiosity got the best of him. &#34;Why are you smiling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;I&#39;m really impressed.&#34; Alexander, assuming it was praise, opened his mouth to offer a polite reply-but before he could, Daniela added, &#34;You&#39;re unbelievable! Jerk!&#34;</p>
