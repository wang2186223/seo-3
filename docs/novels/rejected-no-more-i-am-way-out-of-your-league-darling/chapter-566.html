                <p>Natalie frowned. &#34;What is there to consider? Daniela,I&#39;m a Dury! I carry the same last name as your mother! If you refuse to help me, do you really think your mother would approve if she were still alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried an air of entitlement, as if Daniela owed her everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, unfazed. &#34;But my mother isn&#39;t alive anymore. If you found a way to bring her back,maybe then she&#39;d hand you the role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s frustration spiked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she known just how ruthless Daniela could be,she never would have gotten involved in the scheme to eliminate Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Brylee had truly doted on her. Whenever she pleaded, Brylee never failed to give her what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, regret consumed Natalie, her anger shifting towards Elyse. Back then, she had only been a teenager, too young to understand the consequences. But Elyse? She was already an adult and still lacked any sense of judgment, causing her own sister&#39;s demise. Pure foolishness had sealed their fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s delicate features contorted with rage. &#34;Aunt is gone now. What else can I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dared not confront Daniela head-on. The truth was-she feared Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Daniela responded better to sorrow than force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of Daniela&#39;s sight, she pinched her thigh hard,forcing tears to well up in her eyes. Then, with a well-practiced blink, they fell. &#34;Daniela, I know what you&#39;re holding against me. You believe my mother and I had a hand in your mother&#39;s death. Yes, my mother was involved, but me? How old was I then?What could I have possibly done? At most, I spoke carelessly. My mother, in her blind ignorance, caused her sister&#39;s death. Every time I think of Aunt&#39;s tragic end, my heart aches. If you want justce, take it up with my mother. She&#39;s the one responsible for everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie locked eyes with Daniela, her expression pleading. &#34;If you want, you can even sue my mother.I&#39;ll be your witness.Iswear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her breath, waiting for Daniela&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed, taking a slow sip of water before speaking. &#34;So, you&#39;re saying you&#39;re willing to take your own mother to court? She&#39;s your biological mother, the one who raised you. Can you bear to do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded, sorrow etched across her face. &#34;Yes,it would be difficult, but she brought this upon herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back into the sofa, her expression  unreadable. &#34;P&#39;ll think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left Daniela&#39;s lips, Natalie&#39;s facelit up with excitement. &#34;Daniela, the guilty must pay for their sins! Don&#39;t go soft on her! Oh, by the way,about the lead role in that film...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was icy. &#34;You&#39;re too late. The lead role has already been taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;Who took my role? Who dares to steal my place?&#34; Her expression darkened with rage. &#34;Daniela, we&#39;re family! I even said I&#39;d testify against my own mother for you. Isn&#39;t that proof of my sincerity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a sharp sneer.11SO1testifying against your mother is just a bargaining chip for the lead role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie flinched,panic creeping into her voice. &#34;No!I&#39;m testifying against her because it&#39;s the right thing to do! But Daniela, we&#39;re family! How could you hand such an incredible opportunity to an outsider?&#34; Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. &#34;It&#39;s not an outsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stiffened. &#34;Then who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smirk deepened. &#34;Your sister, Nina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, the door creaked open, and NJina stepped into view. She met Natalie&#39;s stunned gaze with a pleasant smile. &#34;Natalie, long time no see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression soured instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered casually, &#34;Natalie, if you don&#39;t mind,there&#39;s still a supporting role available. Want to consider it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood just behind Daniela, a smile on her face-one that made Natalie&#39;s blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice was sweet, almost teasing. &#34;Sorry,Natalie, but the lead role is mine. The supporting role isn&#39;t too bad, though. Decent screen time. Worth considering-unless, of course, you can&#39;t handle being beneath me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s hands curled into trembling fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen time, the character&#39;s depth, the lines-everything paled in comparison to the lead role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been above Nina in every way. And now, she was expected to endure this disgrace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie called out to Daniela desperately, but Daniela was already on her feet. &#34;Think about it. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m heading upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scrambled forward. &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela was already climbing the stairs,leaving Natalie behind, seething with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie spun on Nina, snapping, &#34;Go tell Daniela you want the supporting role instead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina chuckled. &#34;Not a chance.&#34; And with that, she stepped into her room, shutting the door behind her. Natalie stood frozen in the living room, fists clenched so tight her nails dug into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to wring Nina&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be the star! The only one who mattered!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, someone had been watching her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian folded her arms, amusement flickering in her eyes. &#34;Elyse, did you hear that? Your daughter wants to send you to prison!&#34;</p>
