                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t in the best of moods. Turning her head, she fixed Katrina with a blank expression, her gaze coId and intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clamped her mouth shut, instinctively retreating a step in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela advanced towards her slowly, step by step,forcing Katrina to back away until she hit a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed the gap between them, standing just inches away. &#34;Katrina, if it&#39;s trouble you want, I&#39;ll gladly give it to you. Keep pushing me, and you&#39;ll face the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though fear flickered in her eyes, Katrina refused to back down and feigned confidence. &#34;You think I&#39;m scared of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a derisive snort, slid her hands into her coat pockets, and walked away without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina brushed off the warning, assuming it was an empty threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for her to realize how wrong she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A domestic financial crisis struck, obliterating all the secret investments Katrina had made behind Caiden&#39;s back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the funds Joyce had recently provided her were wiped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stared at her depleted bank account in shock,a wave of unease washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, she called Joyce, but her calls went unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the servant brought up the unpaid living expenses for what felt like the fiftieth time, Katrina lost her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt, can&#39;t you be reasonable for once? It&#39;s been just a week since I last paid you. Do you even realize how much I&#39;ve given you in the past? I&#39;m facing a minor setback, and you&#39;re acting like | can&#39;t pay.What&#39;s the meaning of this? Do you really think I&#39;d cheat you over a sum this small?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant sneered, curling her lips. &#34;Who knows?You&#39;re only here because you forced yourself in.What&#39;s past is past. Right now, you owe me my salary. If you&#39;re so capable, why don&#39;t you pay the 5,800 dollars first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shut her eyes for a moment. &#34;You&#39;re underestimating me. 5, 800 dollars? Make it a hundred thousand before you come back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her mouth, the servant untied her apron. &#34;Forget it. I&#39;ve had enough. Keep your money.I quit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the servant flung her grease-stained apron at Katrina, who yanked it off in disgust as the woman stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other options left, Katrina decided to seek out Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in the lobby of Joyce&#39;s home, Katrina&#39;s ears picked up on the unmistakable sounds coming from upstairs, leaving little to the imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt an unsettling weight in the air, but the servants around her carried on as though nothing unusual was happening, their faces devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sipped her coffee, trying to mask her discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The muffled sounds from upstairs changed, evolving into anguished screams and finally into desperate,gut-wrenching pleas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harsh, guttural cries were punctuated by the sharp crack of a whip, reverberating through the grand villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s hands shook, the coffee cup trembling against its saucer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always known Doug had a dark side, but she hadn&#39;t imagined it was this depraved.A chill of dread coiled around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she gathered the courage to leave, the eerie silence upstairs brought her to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and Doug emerged at the top of the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp, narrow eyes locked onto her, a glimmer of amusement flickering within them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity of his gaze sent a wave of unease washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina rose to make her escape, but Doug&#39;s voice pinned her in place. &#34;Are you here for Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced herself to respond, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second room upstairs. Go on in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Doug pushed open the patio door and strolled into the yard, golf club in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina remained frozen, waiting until she was absolutely certain he was out of sight before heading upstairs cautiously.The door stood slightly ajar, and a faint, metallic scent of blood seeped through the opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A servant brushed past her, carrying a cup of coffee in and emerging moments later with a rumpled quilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hesitated before pushing the door open. The room was dimly lit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the doorway, she called out softly,&#34;Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words seemed to trigger the automatic curtains,which drew back with a mechanical hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, pooling onto the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Katrina grasp the scale of the room-an expansive two hundred square meters, barren except for a massive bed and an adjoining bathroom.</p>
