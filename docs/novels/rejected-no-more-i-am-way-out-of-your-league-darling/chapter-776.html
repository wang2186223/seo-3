                <p>Across the treetops, the wind whispered a soft rustle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, Daniela remained oblivious to the door sliding open</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only sensed a quick movement passing by</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious,she lifted her head and found Cedric&#39;s room empty. Just as she was about to look away, she caught Carol&#39;s mischievous glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Daniela asked, clearly puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pointed upstairs and replied, &#34;Cedric headed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded. &#34;Okay.&#34; On most days, Cedric would go upstairs to tidy her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was neat, and he could spend an hour there without hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rarely commented on his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he chose to organize, she preferred to let him be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when Carol mentioned it, Daniela naturally assumed Cedric was busy tidying up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head and returned to her reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol knew Daniela had gotten it wrong, yet she chose not to correct her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she sent a message in the chat group. &#34;I bet dinner that Daniela will boot Cedric out of the room tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan quickly added, &#34;Wow! Cedric&#39;s brave enough to go to her room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was also in the chat, while Daniela was the only one missing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group bore the name &#34;Help me!&#34; and Cedric was its admin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded with an indignant emoji and a comment,&#34;I&#39;ve been in that room plenty of times, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian joined in, &#34;What&#39;s different this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;I brought my own blanket, although...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only laid the blanket under the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Daniela well. If he stayed on the bed, she would simply let him have it and sleep downstairs instead. So, he decided to take it slow. Cedric wrapped himself in the blanket, looking like a giant caterpillar</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela later opened the door,she found that &#34;caterpillar&#34; busy playing a game</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened to be the latest game developed by her company</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of gunfire rang out loud and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric heard the door shift and turned his head.&#34;You&#39;re back? I thought you&#39;d take a bit longer &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked in and asked plainly, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his phone. &#34;Playing a game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew that, of course. Her question had more to do with why he was in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she didn&#39;t tell him to leave right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After washing up in the bathroom, she returned and found the game switched off. Cedric had bundled himself up in the blanket, pretending to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the bed, her eyes resting on the &#34;caterpillar&#34; at her feet. &#34;Cedric, are you seriously trying to act cute?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peeked up at her with a grin. &#34;I&#39;m just crashing on the floor I&#39;m wiped out, and the downstairs bed is soaked. Can I just stay here tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried just enough misery to stir sympathy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were plenty of rooms in the villa, but he made it sound like Daniela&#39;s floor was the last safe space on Earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of her wanted to ask if he was the Lone Wolf&#39;s leader</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the words stayed tucked inside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether he was or wasn&#39;t didn&#39;t matter anymore.He was just Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And deep down, she already knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted the blanket, lay on the bed, and said gently, &#34;Just go to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric immediately popped into the group chat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mission accomplished! Yeah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan asked, &#34;All that joy over sleeping on a floor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian added, &#34;It&#39;s not just any floor. It&#39;s her floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dropped in a crying emoji. &#34;You two better show up and help me out!&#34; Then he set his phone aside and shut his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, he had no trouble sleeping. But that night,the stillness felt different. He lay there quietly, eyes fixed on the ceiling, heart racing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you asleep?&#34; he whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked and tried again, softer this time. &#34;Honey?&#34;</p>
