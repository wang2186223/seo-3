                <p>Hackett wouldn&#39;t be foolish enough to kill Cedric himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he convened the major members of the association,excluding only Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s consider imposing another wave of commercial sanctions against Cedric.&#34; Hackett rallied the others passionately. &#34;We must seek retribution for Marcus &#39;death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno narrowed his eyes, his stare piercing. &#34;Cedric&#39;s bold enough to murder Marcus! We cannot allow him to trample over us without consequences!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp, nodding emphatically, chimed in, &#34;Enduring his provocations wil only embolden Daniela! Since mercy is off the table, striking first seems our only option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Amidst the murmurs, Farley&#39;s silence broke as he balled his hands into fists, inspired by Tripp&#39;s words &#34;Then let&#39;s band together! No retreating, no surrender!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with a unified readiness for action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Huey,with a serene countenance,voiced his dissent. &#34;I  must disagree.&#34; Hackett&#39;s emerging smile faded abruptly.&#34;Huey,what are you implying? Has fear taken hold of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, perplexed, turned to Huey. &#34;Did the recent ordeal frighten you that much? What is there to fear when death is our shared destiny? Daniela seeks vengeance for her mother&#39;s death. She&#39;d come after us regardless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back with an air of calm defiance, Huey replied, &#34;True, death comes for us all. However,l refuse to meet it senselessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Hackett&#39;s frustration boiled over. &#34;Huey,elaborate! What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey stood defiant, his demeanor unshaken by Hackett&#39;s intimidating aura. &#34;Until the truth about Marcus&#39; demise surfaces, my stance against Elite Lux remains unchanged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bold statement plunged the room into an oppressive silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s stare bored into Hackett, a scornful smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. &#34;I am nobody&#39;s pawn, to be discarded in their personal vendettas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room gasped, taken aback by the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett alone seethed with anger, his hand thundering against the table. &#34;Huey, are you insinuating something sinister? Do you dare accuse me of murdering Marcus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s response was a chilling laugh, resonating with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven to fury, Hackett yelled, &#34;Huey, do you not fear the sting of your own conscience? Accusing me of such a heinous act? After all my sacrifices for the association,you repay me with baseless slander? Show me your proof! How could you cast such aspersions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion choked Hackett&#39;s words, his eyes swelling with a mix of rage and sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others around them scrambled to quell the brewing storm, urging peace between the two enraged men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley attempted to mediate, his voice laced with reason. &#34;Huey, please, Hackett has only ever planned for our collective benefit. Temper your fury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Temper my fury?&#34; Huey&#39;s retort was incredulous,his voice rising in protest. &#34;How can I temper my fury when I was inches from death on that rooftop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence once again fell like a heavy blanket over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every pair of eyes turned to Huey, their expressions a mixture of shock and incredulity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s eyes widened, a mix of disbelief and fear clouding his features. &#34;Huey, what are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno chimed in, &#34;Huey, you really shouldn&#39;t say things that could fracture our unity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey rose, his stance bold and unyielding. With Daniela&#39;s formidable support behind him, he had nothing to fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought his hand down hard on the table, making everyone jump. &#34;What am I implying? Isn&#39;t it glaringly obvious? Reflect on it. Why didn&#39;t the fire department show up that day? And why was it Cedric who ultimately held me back? Isn&#39;t the truth apparent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett retorted, &#34;I told you, it was Cedric who shoved me aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sneered dismissively, &#34;What absurdity are you spouting? I was right there. You might deceive the others, but you can&#39;t fool me. Hackett, you plotted my demise at Elite Lux to avoid Daniela&#39;s economic retaliation against you. You aimed for my death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His accusation reverberated through the room,sending a shiver down everyone&#39;s spine and ushering in a profound silence once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re spouting nonsense!&#34; Hackett snapped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s voice was cold as he abruptly kicked the chair beside him. &#34;You know the truth deep down. Let me make this clear: until Marcus&#39; real murderer is uncovered, I won&#39;t go against Daniela. I urge you not to be unwitting pawns in someone else&#39;s game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, Huey stormed out, not once glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murderous fury simmered in Hackett&#39;s eyes as he fought to keep his composure. After a tense moment,he adopted a look of distress and turned to the others,pleading, &#34;I swear, I&#39;m innocent. I can&#39;t fathom why Huey suspects me. Perhaps Cedric has clouded his judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s brow creased in thought, mulling over Huey&#39;s parting words. &#34;I need to reconsider everything Excuse me,&#34; he said, making his exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others dispersed, leaving Bruno alone with Hackett. &#34;Hackett, I trust you. You&#39;ve always been there for us. Why would you betray us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear trickled down Hackett&#39;s cheek as he clutched at a flicker of hope. &#34;It has to be Daniela&#39;s influence over him. It must be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno nodded, his loyalty unwavering. &#34;I&#39;ll confront Daniela myself! Hackett, I&#39;ll right this wrong on your behalf!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Energized by resolve, Bruno set off that afternoon to confront Daniela. That evening, Bruno&#39;s company was bought out for a mere dollar, sending him spiraling into despair and eventually a psychiatric ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Tripp&#39;s company suffered the same fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified, Farley sought out Huey. &#34;What deal did you strike with Daniela? I&#39;ll do anything to protect my company and family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey took out a confession from his drawer.</p>
