                <p>Katrina stepped into the room and murmured a sincere &#34;Thank you&#34; to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered Katrina a fleeting glance but chose to remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept to herself the fact that Katrina had implored her to withhold the dividends, understanding well that anger, when allowed to fester and boil over time, could erupt with devastating effect. This was when the results were most profound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela maintained her composure, serene and unruffled, while nearby, Johan queried, &#34;When are we going to share a meal together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning her chin on her hand with a soft smile, Daniela replied, &#34;There will be an opportunity soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as Daniela graced the banquet, she couldn&#39;t help but notice Joyce had brought Milo along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp click of her tongue, Lillian shook her head. &#34;Milo really has a way with Joyce, charming her into bringing him here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chimed in, &#34;I heard Milo gave Joyce the cold shoulder, pushing her to borrow money at steep rates just to appease him. He insisted on coming here, and Joyce, fearful of upsetting him, complied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;It seems Joyce&#39;s affair is the talk of our circle now, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. Milo&#39;s playing Joyce like a fiddle, using her to pave his path to more affluent connections. Hle&#39;s quite proud of his manipulations and doesn&#39;t shy from flaunting them. Tragically, Joyce is blinding herself to the reality, trapping herself with no way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a spark of curiosity, Lillian leaned in and questioned, &#34;What&#39;s so special about Milo that Joyce is this crazy about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan cast a glance towards Lillian, remarking with a hint of intrigue,&#34;To thrive in this business, one must possess a certain charm. I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s damn good when it comes to the bedroom.&#34; Overhearing the conversation, Cedric turned his gaze sharply towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifllian grasped Daniela&#39;s arm. &#34;Come, let&#39;s see for ourselves what kind of man Joyce has managed to snag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little resistance, Daniela found herself swept along by Lillian&#39;s enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They approached cautiously, halting a few paces away to observe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milo Brewer, the man linked with Joyce, had an androgynous appeal that blurred the lines of gender.His demeanor shifted intriguingly with his gaze-pitiful when cast downward, yet mysteriously captivating when he looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, when he fixed them on someone, shimmered with a profound affection that was hard to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing tall at six feet three inches, Milo&#39;s heritage was a tapestry of diverse ancestries, highlighted by his striking blue eyes that seemed to capture and reflect every flicker of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thorough appraisal, Lillian affirmed with a nod,&#34;It&#39;s no mystery why Joyce is so enchanted; he&#39;s truly a remarkable sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, after a brief glance, averted her eyes and turned her attention to the fruit beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his looks, she remained unimpressed. Her own allure and the charm of her handsome husband were more than enough for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, he&#39;s watching you,&#34; Lillian whispered, nudging her slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t react at first, her gaze lowered. However, when she finally lifted her eyes, they collided with a pair of deep blue ones, reminiscent of an endless ocean-mysteriously deep and strikingly beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men often shied away from the term&#34;beautiful,&#34; aware it was a standard not easily met. Over her years,Daniela had encountered few who could bear the weight of such a description; Cedric had been one of those rarities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Milo stood before her as the second. Yet, despite his beauty, he lacked Cedric&#39;s breathtaking allure.He was simply, undeniably beautiful-nothing more. As their eyes locked, Milo approached her with a smooth stride. &#34;Ms. Harper, I&#39;ve heard so much about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered him a courteous smile.&#34;Likewise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving a lingering curiosity in her wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Milo watched her departure, swirling the wine in his glass. A smirk played on his lips,piqued by the enigma of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Lillian inquired, &#34;Daniela, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scrunched her nose slightly. &#34;His cologne is overpowering. It&#39;s almost suffocating me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight tilt of her head, Lillian mused, &#34;Is that so? I personally find it rather charming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan,wearing a scowl, abruptly pulled Lillian away, cutting their conversation short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening wound down and the banquet drew to a close, Cedric slipped out to fetch the car. Daniela lingered by the entrance when Milo suddenly emerged beside her. Startled, she instinctively stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brisk wind funneling through the entryway buffeted Milo, who stood in its gusts. Daniela adjusted her scarf upwards, partly to shield herself from the chill and partly to block the waft of his cologne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, you&#39;re tearing my heart to pieces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered him a faint smile. &#34;Would you mind keeping a distance of five steps,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obligingly, Milo raised his hands in a gesture of compliance and retreated five steps. &#34;Tell me, what&#39;s your favorite fragrance? Next time, I&#39;ll wear it just for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His every phrase seemed to waltz on the edge of flirtation, yet remained tastefully non-intrusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, may I be so bold as to ask for your contact information? I have long admired you from afar, and to meet you today has been nothing short of captivating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milo exuded confidence, clearly at ease in the interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His history told him that strong, successful women like Daniela appreciated acknowledgment and flattery. He leveraged his extensive experience to make his approach, confident of his eventual success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really? Well, paying for men isn&#39;t my style. I&#39;ve heard your smile could launch a thousand ships, and frankly, I can&#39;t afford that kind of expense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re far too modest. As the CEO of Elite Lux, is there really anything out of your reach? I suppose I just haven&#39;t captured your attention yet. No matter, I relish a good challenge, and time is on my side.&#34; With a graceful bow, Milo tipped an imaginary hat to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he turned to leave, he flashed Daniela a conspiratorial wink and a grin.′′Asmile that could launch a thousand ships, for sure. But yours? It&#39;s in a league of its own, worth a million times more. If you&#39;d agree to spend some time with me,I&#39;ll gladly serve you in any way. What do you say?&#34;</p>
