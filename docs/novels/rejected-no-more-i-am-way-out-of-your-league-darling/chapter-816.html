                <p>Cedric had learned long ago-when Daniela lost her temper, she didn&#39;t yell. She just left people behind.Once, she&#39;d left him stranded in Olisvine without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing better now, he played it safe. &#34;You&#39;ve got three days,&#34; he told Nikolas. &#34;If you&#39;re still here after that, talk to my wife yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas let out a slow smirk. &#34;Look at you.Completely leashed. What a shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t rise to the bait. But just before turning the corner, he paused and asked, &#34;Why&#39;d you really cut ties with the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t believe the story Nikolas had told earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hadn&#39;t expected him to press like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, he ducked into the bathroom. &#34;I&#39;m showering. Get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned on the doorframe. &#34;What happened to that milk bath you were crying about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it!&#34; Nikolas barked from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Cedric couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Nikolas wasn&#39;t being honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as Daniela came down the stairs, the first thing she noticed was Nikolas lounging on the sofa, legs crossed, looking like he belonged in a portrait. He wore the cotton pajamas he&#39;d borrowed from Cedric, flipping through a newspaper like it was part of his routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked past him without so much as a glance and headed into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clicked his tongue. &#34;Did you not even see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a meeting scheduled later, and she wanted to go over a few partner profiles before eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reviewed the documents, her eyes narrowed at one name in particular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas caught it and stood. He peeked at the file in her hand-Alexander&#39;s name was right on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke without looking up. &#34;So,Alexander&#39;s handling a McCoy Group branch now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded.&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t ask anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t resist one more poke. With Cedric just reaching the stairs, Nikolas turned to Danielaand said, &#34;Alexander&#39;s after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned back, visibly entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,they had breakfast together without incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric went out to get the car, Nikolas, too restless to sit around, insisted on joining Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stood by the door waiting for Cedric to bring the car around, Daniela broke the silence. &#34;I&#39;m only going to say this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice remained steady, but her expression carried a chilling edge. Nikolas had never seen her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you&#39;re scheming, that&#39;s your business.I don&#39;t care. But if you want even the slightest respect from me, you&#39;d better stop making life harder for Cedric. He treats you like family-that&#39;s the only reason you&#39;re even still here. Keep pulling the same stunts you pulled today, and I promise it&#39;ll go worse for you than it did when Hamilton cut you off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas furrowed his brow. &#34;What did I even do?Besides, you&#39;re meeting with those business folks today. Sooner or later, Cedric&#39;s going to hear about it.You really think you can hide it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murderous glint flashed in Daniela&#39;s eyes. It was unmistakable and unrestrained, leaving Nikolas momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How he finds out isn&#39;t your concern. I told you l&#39;d only say this once. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself. The only reason you could stay in my place is Cedric letting you. Next time you pull something like you did this morning, I won&#39;t let it slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric&#39;s car rolled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped in and shut the door behind her without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, flustered. &#34;I wasn&#39;t,even inside yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled away, leaving him on the steps. It took a few seconds for him to understand-Daniela had just issued a second warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of it dropped into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric could earn such loyalty from someone like her,who could even steal her from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his eyes, Nikolas felt like the whole world had turned its back on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Carol stepped out and caught the look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a light smile. &#34;Daniela&#39;s not that hard to get along with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, &#34;You&#39;re joking, right? She&#39;s terrifying That&#39;s your idea of easy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol laughed. &#34;You don&#39;t get it. Daniela is strict with herself but lenient with others. She protects her own and won&#39;t let anyone mistreat the people close to her. That includes you now. Just stay on the right side of her. You&#39;ve already seen what happens when you don&#39;t. As long as you don&#39;t cross that line, she&#39;s honestly not hard to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;So, are you telling me to be nice to Cedric?&#34;</p>
