                <p>Hamilton had already swallowed the first wave of shock and forced his mind to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the update now, he was not as dumbstruck as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered flatly, &#34;I understand.&#34; Then he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the line went dead, he sank into a quiet stretch that dragged on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stepped closer and set down a cup of coffee. &#34;Mr. McCoy, this baby is your grandchild.We need to keep it safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow tightened as he lifted the cup and took a slow sip. His voice came out rough. &#34;If I wvant this child, I have to accept Daniela as Cedric&#39;s wife.But what about the princess?&#34; Every part of Hamilton resisted the idea. &#34;Cedric&#39;s just about to marry the princess! How are we supposed to handle this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood to the side, thinking the timing of this child was quite opportune. Hamilton was too stubborn, insisting on pairing Cedric with the princess. And this child might just force him to face reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, Cedric&#39;s heart has always stayed with Daniela. Kid or no kid, he never planned to leave her.So why not let this baby help fix things between you and Daniela? As for the princess, you could use the child as an excuse. She&#39;ll have to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scowled deeper. &#34;So you expect me to grovel to Daniela now? Absolutely not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raked his fingers through his hair, frustration leaking through every word. &#34;You know how distant she is. If I have to lower myself to win her over, what a joke. I&#39;m Cedric&#39;s father. And I&#39;m supposed to bend to her? Ridiculous!&#34; While Hamilton vented, he shot a sideways glare at the secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary bit back a laugh, though the grin tugged at his lips anyway. He knew well enough that Hamilton&#39;s pride would never let this go easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try not to see it that way, Mr. McCoy. Think about it for your grandchild&#39;s future. Wouldn&#39;t it be wise to make peace with Daniela? Picture it for a moment.Daniela holds serious power. She commands the mercenaries and owns the largest intelligence network in the world. She&#39;s so fierce the rest of the McCoy family can barely sleep at night. The child of hers would be born with immense advantages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s frown softened a notch. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. Plus, that baby will have Carol and others risking their lives for protection. Money,connections, influence-everything will be at the child&#39;s feet. They&#39;ll live a life others can&#39;t even dream about. Isn&#39;t that worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s forehead smoothed a little more. &#34;So l should see it that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Daniela may act cold, but she&#39;s fair when treated well. She didn&#39;t cling to old grudges. She&#39;s focused on her mother&#39;s revenge, not you. Show her respect, and she&#39;ll remember it. As for that princess,she&#39;s hnigh and mighty, true. But even if Cedric marries her, he can&#39;t become king overnight. The princess&#39;s father is still healthy. He&#39;d be stuck waiting for at least ten more years. Do you really want that? Think carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton thought back to how domineering the king could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong. But Daniela&#39;s mother was murdered by the McCoy family. Daniela will never let that rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it. On one hand, you&#39;re treated like a money machine by the McCoy family. On the other,you could have a cherished grandchild by your side.Which sounds better to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton went quiet, eyes clouded. The secretary continued, &#34;Besides, if you keep fighting with Daniela, she&#39;ll shut you out of the child&#39;s life for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot up. &#34;How could she? That&#39;s my blood.I have to handle their upbringing myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. So if you really accept this, you need to move fast. We both know Daniela is probably pregnant already. Remember Daniela lost a child because of the McCoy family a few years back? Your father ordered everyone to drop it. Do you want history to repeat itself? This is Oiscoll. Daniela&#39;s vulnerable here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face stiffened at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the reaction, the secretary continued,&#34;Weren&#39;t you once worried your sons couldn&#39;t measure up to Daniela? Didn&#39;t you fear Cedric wNould get played by her? Now it&#39;s different. Shes carrying Cedric&#39;s child. She&#39;ll do everything to build that child&#39;s future. Stay on her good side, and McCoy Group will naturally fall under her care.&#34;The secretary still remembered how ruthlessly Daniela crushed Josh&#39;s schemes. Watching it made his own spine tingle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing he didn&#39;t have to fight her anymore lifted a weight off his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he wanted Hamilton to fix this mess with Daniela quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they patched things up, Hamilton&#39;s siblings would be no match for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary glanced at Hamilton&#39;s uncertain expression and cleared his throat. &#34;If word spreads about Daniela&#39;s pregnancy, you know what your siblings will do. They must be restless already,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton listened, and his expression changed abruptly.</p>
