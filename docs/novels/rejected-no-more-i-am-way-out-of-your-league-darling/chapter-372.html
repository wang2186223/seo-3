                <p>In the end, Joyce decided not to take Katrina&#39;s body away. If she did, it would&#39;ve sparked all kinds of rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And on top of that, Doug wouldn&#39;t have let her bring back a dead body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business people were often scared of bad luck and superstitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce knew she couldn&#39;t go against Doug, so she walked away, her heart heavy with sorrow. She kept looking back, her eyes filled with resentment,locking onto Daniela with a cold, murderous gaze. &#34;Daniela!Just wait! I&#39;ll make you pay for this,&#34; she muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day of Katrina&#39;s burial was kept incredibly simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so basic it almost felt sad. What they&#39;d done for her barely qualified as a funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden wasn&#39;t there at all. The housekeeper mentioned he&#39;d gone fishing first thing in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once-glamorous woman had such a lonely,desolate end. Daniela lingered for a moment in front of Katrina&#39;s simple tombstone, then turned and walked away slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t thought she&#39;d run into Alexander there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really went too far,&#34; Alexander said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on, &#34;Joyce cried all night. She&#39;s sure you planned Katrina&#39;s death. Doug&#39;s got power, and with his money, Joyce could build an empire. It&#39;s not out of the question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really? She can give it a try,&#34; Daniela said, staring at the fading sunset with a neutral expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth, but Daniela&#39;s icy gaze stopped him, a half-smile playing on her lips. &#34;I lost my mother too, suddenly, and had to grow up fast.Joyce is too naive. I&#39;m actually curious to see how far she can go. Honestly, I&#39;m kind of looking forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw. &#34;She&#39;ll use me against you.Don&#39;t you see that yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh. &#34;In that case, I&#39;ll take back what I said. If her big move is just you, I&#39;m not interested. You&#39;re not even worth being my opponent.&#34;She flashed a faint, sarcastic smile at Alexander. Ignoringthe pale color draining from his face, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the foot of the mountain,she saw Cedric standing there, holding an umbrella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chilly, intense vibe around her melted away instantly as she saw him. &#34;You&#39;re here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t say a word, just pressed his lips together,and tilted the umbrella towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had driven himself here. Daniela climbed into Cedric&#39;s car and her driver followed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you upset?&#34; Daniela asked, though comforting others wasn&#39;t exactly her thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never been one to hold back with those around her,always speaking her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was an exception, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not going to tell me the truth, then don&#39;t bother trying to coax me. I&#39;m not angry, and I don&#39;t need your pity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s first try at offering comfort was a complete flop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later when she told Lillian about Cedric&#39;s response,Lillian burst out laughing so hard she had to hold her stomach. &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve offended him this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. After Cedric dropped her off, he headed back to Elite Lux&#39;s lounge to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they&#39;d gotten together, they hadn&#39;t spent much time apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, Daniela wasn&#39;t used to being apart from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for the moment, she wasn&#39;t sure how to comfort him-or maybe, she just hadn&#39;t figured out how to open up yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat quietly on the swing in the courtyard, her eyes tracing the bright moon hanging in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished Cedric could wait just a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In six months, she promised herself, she would have everything sorted out. By then, the danger would be behind her, and she would finally be able to tell the world that Cedric was her lawful husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, he would understand the depth of her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been watching for a few days now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Cedric had been going back to the lounge to sleep every night, no matter how late it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he went to a banquet with Daniela, he&#39;d always come back after dropping her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was no exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina went home, enjoyed a long hot bath, put on some perfume, and slipped into sexy lingerie beneath a big trench coat. Then she headed straight for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night grew darker, Nina watched the elevator numbers rise, her heart pounding in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,everything she&#39;d dreamed of, all the effort she&#39;d put into this moment,would finally pay off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bottle of wine in hand, she couldn&#39;t help but smile as she pushed open the door to Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the door swung open, her smile instantly froze.&#34;Ryan? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door between the CEO&#39;s office and the lounge was open, revealing Ryan and Cedric sitting at the table,sipping red wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Ryan and Cedric were surprised to see Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric furrowed his brow. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still wearing his deep blue silk shirt from the banquet, his long legs fitting perfectly in his trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically serious and distant, he seemed more relaxed  now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the moonlight, Cedric looked incredibly handsome, almost like he wasn&#39;t real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina swallowed nervously, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;I came back to the secretary&#39;s office to grab something. I saw the light on, so I came in. Did I disturb you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his gaze away, speaking without emotion. &#34;No. You can leave now. Close the door behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina curled her red lips into a smile. &#34;Are you upset?This wine is really good. Want to give it a try? It has an amazing taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised the bottle of wine and, without waiting for his response, walked into the room with it.</p>
