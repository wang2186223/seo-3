                <p>Nina departed from the Harper family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove, the driver glanced back and said &#34;The car behind seems to be tailing us intentionally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; Nina responded, observing that the car,which had been following them so closely, suddenly turned at the intersection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver became quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning to the Dury family home, Nina found both Elyse and Natalie waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Natalie laid eyes on Nina, she spotted the jade bracelet on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard the bracelet was a gift from the Wesker family to their daughter-in-law-an heirloom worth millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes narrowed, a flash of envy crossing her In her eyes, Nina was a fool who ended up with things she herself didn&#39;t desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Nina possess something so valuable now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spiteful glint sparkled in Natalie&#39;s eyes as she raised her hand to block Nina&#39;s path. &#34;Aren&#39;t you scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina glanced at Natalie. &#34;Scared of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie smirked. &#34;Aren&#39;t you worried the Wesker family will discover you slept with Linden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina furrowed her brows. &#34;Are you threatening me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie chuckled. &#34;If you think so, then I suppose it is. I don&#39;t care who you marry, but if Linden wants to sleep with me, you&#39;ll have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina knew Daniela had a plan in place, so she held back from revealing it. &#34;I can&#39;t. I&#39;m going to marry Sammy.I can&#39;t do such things. You&#39;re so capable.Why don&#39;t you go? After all, it was you Linden wanted from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes gleamed with malicious coldness.&#34;If you don&#39;t agree, I&#39;ll make your affair with Linden public. The Wesker family cares about their reputation. Once that video of you and Linden spending the night together gets out, do you think they&#39;ll still want you? By then, even Daniela won&#39;t be able to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina mirrored Daniela&#39;s confident demeanor,standing firm in defense of her happiness. &#34;Is that so? I&#39;m part of the Dury family. My disgrace is yours as well. The world will know how the Dury family failed to raise me, and I&#39;ll expose all your secrets. I&#39;ll show them how the picture-perfect, glamorous Natalie is nothing but a manipulative schemer. If no one will marry me because of it, then no one will dare marry you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was furious at Nina&#39;s calm response.&#34;How dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina sneered. &#34;If you&#39;re out to ruin me, why should I hold back?&#34; Ignoring Natalie&#39;s contorted face, she made her way upstairs to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her room had turned into little more than a storage space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina didn&#39;t care anymore. She had given up on this family entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed both the gold bracelet from her father and the jade one from the Wesker family onto one wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the gold bracelet in her hand, she whispered,&#34;Dad, can you see this? I&#39;m getting married soon.l&#39;ll be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina collected her things and walked downstairs, not bothering to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse remained seated on the sofa. &#34;Nina, are you sure you won&#39;t listen to me and Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran through Nina. She turned to Elyse and asked quietly, &#34;Mom, I&#39;m getting married tomorrow. Don&#39;t you have anything to say? Not even a blessing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stared at the coffee table and replied coldly, &#34;If you defy me, I&#39;ll disown you! I don&#39;t even want to speak at your wedding, let alone bless it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina nodded, realizing she had no tears left for such a heartless Elyse. Maybe she had been disappointed enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina walked out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to get in the car, Elyse suddenly called out, &#34;Nina, I&#39;m asking you one last time. Will you listen to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hesitated with her hand on the car door before getting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Nina&#39;s eyes were rimmed with red. She looked down at the bracelet on her wrist, about to smile when her expression suddenly froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up in shock, realizing the car wasn&#39;t headed towards the Harper family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, where are you taking me?&#34; Nina demanded,her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car sped up, rushing down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened around the door handle as her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop the car! I told you, stop the car!&#34; she yelled,panic rising in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the car surged forward, merging onto the highway, then veering onto a lonely side road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear swept over Nina, and she cursed herself for not listening to Daniela and for not bringing a bodyguard along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frantically, she grabbed her phone, aiming to dial Daniela, but the driver swerved sharply, jerking Nina to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone flew from her grasp, the screen flashing with Daniela&#39;s name. Nina reached for it, but it slipped further away.As she gripped the seat with all her strength, the sound of her jade and gold bracelets clashing rang through the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned as she stared at Daniela&#39;s name,realizing this was her last chance to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her fingers hovered over the screen, the car suddenly halted. Stunned, Nina had no time to react befoe she was forcefully dragged out of the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears blurred her vision as she watched Daniela&#39;s name fade from the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sob, she closed her eyes, the tears flowing freely down her face.</p>
