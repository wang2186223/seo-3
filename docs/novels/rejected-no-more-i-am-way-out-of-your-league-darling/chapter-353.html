                <p>A shiver ran through Katrina as her eyes locked onto Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, let me go! P&#39;ll confess everything, but I can&#39;t surrender myself. I just can&#39;t. If I do, everythingI′Ve built will be destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were icy as she gave a small nod. &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve already chosen the path that&#39;ll destroy you. Fine, I won&#39;t stop you. But don&#39;t expect any help from me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Daniela slid into her car, showing no interest in letting Katrina speak further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, Katrina ran after the car, her voice cracking as she cried out, &#34;Daniela! Don&#39;t leave me! Take me with you! l&#39;ll tell you everything. Isn&#39;t that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was raw, and soon she crumpled to the ground, struggling to catch her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears flowed freely down her face as she stared at the unfamiliar faces surrounding her, her fear spiraling out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was paralyzed by fear. Yet no one stepped forward to offer her solace or protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her trembling hands reached for her phone as she dialed Caiden&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he answered, his voice was icy.&#34;Do you realize what you&#39;ve done to me? I used to have a daughter l was proud of, and now I have nothing. I&#39;m stuck in this godforsaken place, being ridiculed as a man who depends on women. You&#39;ve ruined everything, even turned my brothers against me. You&#39;re the one to blame! And now you want me to help you? I wish you were dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;dead&#34; cut through Katrina, and she couldn&#39;t bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up the phone in haste and called Joyce instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was in the garden when a maid approached her. &#34;Ma&#39;am, a man named Alexander Bennett is here to see you.&#34; Joyce smiled and dismissed Katrina&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the maid, she said, &#34;Let him in. And you can go ahead and leave after that. I&#39;ve got a dinner party tonight, so you&#39;ll have tomorrow off. I need to catch up on some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid nodded obediently. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander stepped inside, the maid quetly gathered her things and left, leaving the space feeling unexpectedly empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce continued tending to the flowers, tose that Doug particularly adored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hear the footsteps behind her, drawing nearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized it was Alexander, even before he came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped behind her, standing in silence for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, however,wasn&#39;t pressed for time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned into the moment and waited for Alexander to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She enjoyed the stillness, savoring the power of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he spoke, his voice steady but resigned. &#34;I can agree to your long-term lover. Just tell me your price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Joyce&#39;s lips curled into a sly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rush of satisfaction was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had once looked down on her, and deep inside, he still did, but he had no choice now but to submit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thrived on this feeling of control, loving every second of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head slowly, her eyes glinting with interest as they met Alexander&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say? I didn&#39;t quite catch it.&#34; Her voice dropped, icy and mocking. &#34;Say that again?&#34; Alexander knew that coming to Joyce meant sacrificing his pride, but even now, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself wishing Daniela were the one standing before him instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela, it wouldn&#39;t feel like humiliation-it would have been playful, even enticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood frozen while Joyce watched him patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him time, waiting for him to finally surrender, piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll say it again.&#34; Alexander clenched his jaw, grinding his pride into dust. &#34;I accept your terms. What do you have to offer me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a sharp, wild laugh, almost manic in its tone. With a smug look, she turned to Alexander and asked, &#34;This is the money I earned through sleeping with Doug. Does that bother you?&#34;</p>
