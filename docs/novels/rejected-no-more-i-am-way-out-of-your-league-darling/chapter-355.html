                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver, not even for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a detached grunt, she shifted her focus back to the meeting minutes, her demeanor unruffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan blinked in surprise, sharing a look wvith Cedric before trailing after her.&#34;Daniela, aren&#39;t you even a little shocked? Don&#39;t you have anything to say about what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was steady. &#34;What exactly am I supposed to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan narrowed his eyes, suspicion etched on his face. &#34;I&#39;m beginning to wonder if you ever actually liked Alexander. Didn&#39;t everyone say you were in love with him for ten years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a simple nod. &#34;I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s doubt deepened. &#34;Is this how someone acts after loving someone for ten years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten years-a whole decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a lifetime, a decade is no small span of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ten years, Alexander had been the center of Daniela&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he had plummeted from his pedestal, reduced to a shadow of his former self in front of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Daniela&#39;s emotions seemed completely untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan found it impossible to wrap his head around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this really be what love looked like after ten long years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan ran a hand through his hair, glancing at Daniela as she continued signing papers without a flicker of emotion. &#34;Cedric, do you think she really doesn&#39;t care, or is it all an act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, unsure. Later that night, he pulled Daniela into his arms and murmured, &#34;If that&#39;s the kind you prefer, I can be like that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-asleep, Daniela let out a soft &#34;Mm,&#34; the meaningof Cedric&#39;s words slowly registering in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she slipped into slumber, she murmured, &#34;Cedric, I see how hard you&#39;re trying to be the perfect husband.I truly value that, but what matters most is that you&#39;re both my husband and your true seIf. Whatever role life may bring, stay true to who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s love had always been expansive-never about chaining the one she cherished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, love that sought to possess and control wasn&#39;t love at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Cedric was convinced that Daniela&#39;s heart was his and his alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t help but notice the calm confidence radiating from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, he had that same unshakable poise, but his arrogance grew from years of taking Daniela&#39;s love for granted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft click of the office door opening broke the silence, and it swung inward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped in, her smile warm and a bag in hand, her gaze landing on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised the bag with a small grin. &#34;Your favorite dish. I packed some for you. If you like it, I&#39;ll grab more next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained off to the side, a bitter wave of humiliation washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, no matter where they were, Daniela&#39;s eyes would find him first. Now, it was as if he didn&#39;t even exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Alexander&#39;s restraint crumbled, and he spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame burned through him, especially after the exposure of Joyce&#39;s videos, but he forced himself to muster courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ready to let go of every shred of his pride. Daniela&#39;s love was the only thing he craved now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＂I need to talk to you. I know you won＇t agree to a private conversation， so r月 say  here，＂ he bturted， his voice trembling with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t even reglstered Alexander&#39;s presence until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed the instant his voice cut through the room. &#34;How did you even get up here?&#34; she asked coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her icy question froze Alexander mid-confession. For a moment, he could only stare at her, utterly stunned and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, his voice quivered as he finally spoke, tinged with accusation.nDo you have any idea how much bravery it took for me to face you?&#34;</p>
