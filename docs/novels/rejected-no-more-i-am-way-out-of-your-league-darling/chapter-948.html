                <p>Josh shot upright the moment he heard Mason had burned a mmillion on cleanup costs. &#34;Daniela! She&#39;ll pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh spun around and barked for his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Hamilton plan to tie Cedric to the princess of Loglil? But Daniela&#39;s baby ruined it, so Hamilton stepped back. If that princess learns she&#39;s been fooled,do you think-she will let this slide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark flickered in the secretary&#39;s eyes. &#34;That&#39;s genius!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s lips curled into a mocking grin. &#34;And they say Daniela&#39;s unstoppable? Wait till she tries saving her marriage now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary flashed a grin and promised, &#34;Leave it to me. I&#39;ll see it done right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the McCoy brothers stood frozen in the bare CEO office of McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did everything go?&#34; One of them gasped at the empty room,nothing but four lonely walls staring back. The office staff kept their heads down as one whispered, &#34;When Mr. Josh McCoy left, he packed it all up. Said he liked his old things and you could redecorate however you liked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word came from the stunned brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad broke the silence. &#34;Good grief. Is this really the JoshIknew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules let out a bitter laugh. &#34;What a fool I was. All his kindness before was just a facade to strip us bare. I trusted him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sighed like hope had bled out of him.&#34;What now? Our shares have tanked and the finance team says Josh keeps stealing our clients. At this rate,we won&#39;t last till sundown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each face darkened with defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad cleared his throat. &#34;Looks like finding Hamilton is our only shot now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules agreed. &#34;That&#39;s it! Hamilton always ran things best. He should be the one fixing this mess now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s voice shook. &#34;But will he even agree? We pushed him out not long ago. Look at the ruin McCoy Group&#39;s in now. He might not want anything to do with it.&#34; Brad held firm. &#34;He&#39;s still our brother. If he truly feels too old to handle it, Cedric can step up next. First,someone has to stop the bleeding. Who leads later can be settled once this crisis passes. Protecting the family&#39;s interests comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one argued. They piled into cars and headed for Hamilton&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler greeted them at the door and sighed. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, sirs, but Mr. McCoy is at Daniela&#39;s home and hasn&#39;t come back yet. Do you wish to wait here, or...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad waved him off. &#34;We&#39;ll go straight to Daniela&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rushed off without wasting a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before stepping inside, Hamilton&#39;s voice carried out, sharp and raging. &#34;That scoundrel Josh! Serves him right! He should have been poisoned for good. Who does he think he is, going after my grandkid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made the brothers share uneasy looks. They all had dirt on their hands too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes found them the instant they showed up. They lowered their voices and greeted him.&#34;Hamilton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw right through them and barked out a cold laugh. &#34;Well, what now? Fooled and now you want to cry at my feet? Sorry. This isn&#39;t the place for your whining. They peeked past him at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slammed the door shut so hard the walls shook. He stood planted firm, hands braced on his hips. &#34;What&#39;s so fascinating in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad snapped his eyes away and let out a nervous laugh. &#34;Hamilton, please don&#39;t be upset. We&#39;re your brothers. You can&#39;t stand seeing McCoy Group crumble,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules jumped in fast. &#34;Exactly. Part of McCoy Group is yours too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added, &#34;Yes. If you don&#39;t come back, we&#39;re done for, Hamilton. You&#39;re the only one who can save us now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They begged with all the desperation left in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was always soft when it came to his family.&#34;I get it. I&#39;ll return tomorrow. But mark my words.Touch my grandkid again and I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers shook their heads fast.′′Wwon&#39;t. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were gone,Hamilton walked over to Cedric.&#34;Pack your things. Tomorrow you&#39;re going to McCoy Group with me.&#34; Deep down, he never doubted he would steer the family back under his roof someday. Although there were losses, the McCoy brothers could only listen to him with Josh&#39;s departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll teach you everything about running McCoy Group.Once I step down, it&#39;ll all be yours.&#34; Hamilton felt sure that once he reclaimed what slipped away, McCoy Group would stand strong again, securing a future for Cedric too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going,&#34; Cedric shot back while slicing vegetables for Daniela&#39;s meal. &#34;It means nothing to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton could tell that his son cared for no one except Daniela. &#34;You may not fight for yourself,but won&#39;t you stand up for Daniela and the baby? Who nowadays complains about having too much wealth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grabbed another handful from the fridge. &#34;We don&#39;t lack money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a point. Daniela was the world&#39;s richest; money was never short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running out of ideas, Hamilton said, &#34;Didn&#39;t you come to Oiscoll to find out who wvas behind the explosion?Daniela already knows who killed her mother, and I&#39;m sure someone in this family had a hand in that blast too.If you step up now, you decide their end with one order. But if someone else takes my place, no matter how sharp Daniela is, hunting them down won&#39;t be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton studied Cedric&#39;s profile. &#34;She&#39;s carrying your child. Do you really want her drained by all this? Tie things up fast so she can rest easy and focus on staying healthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice grew smoother, knowing well that Daniela was Cedric&#39;s softest spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, no one doubts your skills, but even a man like you needs a breather. Think it through. This baby is stirring up enough chaos already. If it turns out to be a boy, do you think the rest of the family will sit back quietly?&#34;</p>
