                <p>When Damon announced that he&#39;d stop using the McCoy family&#39;s money, everyone laughed it off like it was a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep down,only Damon knew-he meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next day, Damon made a beeline for Daniela,purposely steering clear of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worried that Cedric might see him as nothing more than a nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough, between Daniela and Cedric, the former felt more accessible-even if she rarely smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had the softer demeanor, always polite and calm,while Daniela usually wore a blank, unreadable expression. And yet, Damon still chose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found it a bit funny. &#34;Why not Cedric?Technically, he&#39;s your brother. So why are you standing in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Damon curiously, her brows slightly furrowed. Daniela&#39;s beauty was undeniable-sharp features,cool elegance-but when her face was neutral, it carried a chill that made most people keep their distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon pressed his lips together, bracing himself.&#34;I wanted to learn doing business from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare smile touched Daniela&#39;s lips, softening her features. &#34;You wanted to learn doing business from me? Why&#39;s that? Last I heard, your casino&#39;s booming -biggest in the world, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Daniela knew, Damon had poured his family&#39;s wealth into building the casino-strategically placed in a loosely regulated zone where both lawmen and outlaws alike showed him deference. Of course,that respect was less about Damon himself and more a nod to the McCoy family&#39;s formidable name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The casino thrived, pulling in billions every year,outpacing the annual turnover of many established companies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton held a special fondness for Damon, and this success was one of the big reasons why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one point, Hamilton had even considered making Damon the heir to the family legacy, but Damon&#39;s obsession with what Hamilton called &#34;pointless ventures&#34; made him rethink it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve already done well for yourself. So why this sudden interest in learning from me?&#34; Daniela asked,clearly puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father&#39;s not impressed. Says what I know isn&#39;t enough to survive. To him, I&#39;m just a disappointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t mind you learning from me, but honestly, I already see you as quite accomplished. Among people your age, carving out your own empire in a lawless place like that is nothing short of remarkable. And no-I don&#39;t think you owe all your success to the McCoy name. You&#39;ve earned a lot of that on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take Carol, for example-she didn&#39;t just play video games with anyone. But with Damon, they hit it off fast. Now they were practically best friends. That was quite rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon lowered his gaze, voice quiet. &#34;Don&#39;t try to comfort me,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t go around comforting people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon lifted his head at that, locking eyes with Daniela&#39;s unusually serious expression. &#34;But my father has never once praised me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;I can&#39;t speak for your father, but in my eyes, you&#39;re outstanding. With your ability, you&#39;d be running my casino without question.&#34; Damon had never felt so genuinely acknowledged by someone before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had fuly recognized his worth. He looked at her again and asked, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon broke into a wide grin. &#34;Then I&#39;ll work for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow and glanced at the contract.&#34;If you&#39;re okay with angering your father,I&#39;m all for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon nodded eagerly. &#34;Just keep it from my dad.Daniela, I swear you won&#39;t regret this-I&#39;ll make your casino the second biggest in the world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, this was the least he could do to make it up for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nonchalant nod. This business wasn&#39;t her main source of income. Her casino in Oiscoll&#39;s unregulated zone was still in its infancy-a mere playthingin her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Damon was completely serious. &#34;Wait for the next quarterly report!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he walked out with confident strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stepped in, flashing a thumbs-up at Daniela &#34;Well done! He was sulking yesterday, and now look at him-totally fired up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to smile when Kohen walked in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile dimmed a little</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen smiled politely. &#34;Nikolas and Damon already have assignments. Could you find something for me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her eyes, avoiding his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the room, casting an invisible weight in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen often felt-maybe it was just hisimagination-that Daniela&#39;s natural authority mirrored Hamilton&#39;s,leaving him just as uneasy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and said, &#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up slightly and asked, &#34;What&#39;s your take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen responded quickly, &#34;I lack the entrepreneurial drive and casino expertise Damon has. I&#39;ve mostly assisted in the family business. Maybe I could learn from you? Or perhaps manage the construction and engineering side of things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused and repeated, &#34;Construction and engineering projects?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen nodded. &#34;Yes, construction and engineering That&#39;s my strength. I can take full responsibility for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to elaborate further to win her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, construction was a goldmine, even within McCoy Group, where only Hamilton&#39;s most trusted people were given control over it. Despite nearly a decade at McCoy Group, Kohen had only recently been allowed a glimpse into that realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen opened his mouth, about to pitch himself more earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela simply said,&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen froze,startled by how easily she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there for a beat.&#34;Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela still didn&#39;t look up, replying with indifference,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that what you requested?&#34;</p>
