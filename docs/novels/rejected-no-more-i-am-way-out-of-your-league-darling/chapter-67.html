                <p>Chapter was closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she offered him nothing but professional civility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even empathized that Alexander might need time to come to terms with her newfound detachment.After all, adjusting to the absence of her once unwavering affection could be jarring for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Alexander&#39;s expression hardened, his eyes turning frosty. With a curt nod, he stated firmly,&#34;Daniela! If this is how you&#39;re going to carry on, consider this conversation over. You think I&#39;d ever want you back? Pathetic. You&#39;ve let me down in every way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot her a cold glare before turning on his heel and storming out like she wasn&#39;t worth his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room plunged into a profound silence, the air thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several moments later, Daniela blinked, her mind snapping back from the shock. She massaged her temples, let out a deep sigh, and steeled herself to begin the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the office door banged open with such force that it echoed throughout the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes momentarily, a reminder flashing through her mind about enhancing the office security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to kill you, Daniela!&#34; Joyce bellowed as she burst into the room, brandishing a toilet brush like a weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was in disarray, and she appeared as if she&#39;d just emerged from a trench, dirt and all. A troupe of flustered security guards trailed behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper,&#34; the administrative manager gasped, catching up and panting heavily. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry. I did everything I could to stop her, but she wouldn&#39;t hear it. She just didn&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing past the guards, Joyce stormed up to Daniela,her face flushed with rage. &#34;Daniela! You assigned me to toilet cleaning duty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her eyes, her expression serene. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told Mom and Dad you&#39;d appoint me as a director at Elite Lux!&#34; Joyce&#39;s voice teetered on the edge of hysteria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This day was meant to mark her grand entrance as a director at Elite Lux. She had proudly shared the news far and wide, even promising her friends snapshots of her new office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, instead of an executive suite, the administrative staff presented her with a toilet brush. They escorted her to a neglected nook by the basement bathrooms and gestured to a rickety stool-her so-called office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The indignity of it all was overwhelming. With a dismissive gesture, Daniela signaled the security and administrative manager to exit the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were alone, Daniela reclined in her chair, the picture of control. Her lips curled into a smirk as she stared Joyce down. &#34;Have I ever outright denied you the director&#39;s position?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s makeup was a smeared mess, and next to Daniela&#39;s calm elegance, she looked like a frantic wreck-bordering on unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;No, you haven&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze remained unwavering, her tone even. &#34;And indeed, you are a director. No one has stated otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face twisted with rage as she barked, &#34;A &#39;toilet director&#39;? Screw you, Daniela! I&#39;m not your joke! Are the restrooms in Elite Lux decked out in gold or what? Why on earth would they need a director for that? You must be joking with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reclining slightly in her chair, Daniela answered calmly, &#34;Believe it or not, even the headquarters of Elite Lux appoint directors to oversee restroom facilities. The choice to accept the position is yours alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of uncertainty crossed Joyce&#39;s face. &#34;The headquarters have toilet directors too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela affirmed with a nod, &#34;Indeed, they do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, Joyce continued, &#34;Are there any other kinds of director roles available? I really don&#39;t want to be known as a toilet director. It sounds absurd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toilet director? That&#39;s your term, not ours. We certainly don&#39;t call it that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes narrowed as her voice lost a bit of its edge. &#34;Fine. If that&#39;s not it, then what do you call it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;We refer to it as the &#39;Director of Comfort.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title resonated with a certain prestige, casting a dignified air around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce seemed to come to terms with the situation. Daniela added, &#34;Now you&#39;re officially a director at Elite Lux. Think about it; it&#39;s quite a leap from selling clothes on the street, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Joyce glared briefly before storming off without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her out of the way, Waldo sprawled the contract across the table and asked skeptically,&#34;|there really a &#39;Director of Comfort&#39; at the headquarters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, clutching her sides from laughing so hard, confirmed eagerly. &#34;Absolutely! It&#39;s an honorary title we bestow upon family members who pitch in with the cleaning duties. It&#39;s our way of showing respect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In essence, Daniela had been merely playing with Joyce&#39;s expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Cedric strolled into the room. He spotted Daniela at her desk, her head tilted slightly, a subtle smile gracing her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usually rigid demeanor gave way to a brief, unexpected glimmer of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian grinned and quipped playfully, &#34;Mr. Phillips, who could possibly call you cold and aloof? I&#39;m seeing more and more smiles from you lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes drew to Cedric&#39;s unexpectedly cheerful demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strikingly, Daniela hadn&#39;t repeated her usual security concerns today. There was no, &#34;We need to enhance security. How can we just let anyone wander in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the room bathed in a lighter tone and the air filled with ease, everyone&#39;s laughter mingled, casting glances of admiration and respect towards Daniela.</p>
