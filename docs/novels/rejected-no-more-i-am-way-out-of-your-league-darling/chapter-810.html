                <p>Hamilton shot Alexander a disdainful glance and scoffed. &#34;Fix that face of yours first. Just looking at you makes me queasy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no further comment, Hamilton grabbed Alexander and steered him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned toward Daniela. &#34;I swear, Hamilton&#39;s cooking up some shady scheme again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed silent, but in her gut, she knew Alexander had turned into Hamilton&#39;s loyal little mutt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton brought Alexander to McCoy Group&#39;s private plastic surgery clinic. After skimming through a stack of reference photos, he finally stopped on one, slapped it onto the surgeon&#39;s desk, and said,&#34;Turn him into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A closer look at the picture revealed a face straight out of Hollywood-an unrealistic goal that would require a full facial reboot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon strolled in with a confident grin.&#34;Ah,live for a challenge, Mr. McCoy. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll absolutely-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes scanned Alexander&#39;s features.Within seconds, his grin faded like air from a punctured balloon. &#34;Can&#39;t be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared in disbelief. &#34;Why the hell not? You once bragged that unless someone had been butchered before, you could rebuild any face from the ground up. What&#39;s different now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon sighed, rubbing his temples. &#34;He&#39;s already been hacked up by someone else. It&#39;s a lost cause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gawked at Alexander like he&#39;d grown a second head. &#34;So this disaster was the improved version? What level of hideous were you before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cosmetic surgery dream was dead in the water. Hamilton seethed. In a world where appearance was king, Alexander couldn&#39;t even pass as decent-no way Daniela would fall for him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless, of course, she had gone completely blind!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Hamilton&#39;s spiraling rage, Alexander piped up. &#34;Come on, half the women these days act blind when picking guys. I&#39;m not that terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throw on a sharp suit and some clout, and maybe a few women would still bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sneered, &#34;Yeah, maybe you&#39;re not hopeless, but have you seen Cedric? Daniela&#39;s already got a walking sculpture next to her. She&#39;d need a full mental breakdown to go for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shrugged stubbornly. &#34;Then again, maybe she is out of her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, love never played by the rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton massaged his temples in frustration. &#34;Go home for now. Show up at McCoy Group tomorrow.I&#39;ll strike a deal with Daniela&#39;s company to get you working side by side with her. Since your face is hopeless, you&#39;ll have to win her over with talent instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a silent nod and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary shifted awkwardly. &#34;Sir, did it slip your mind? Alexander and Cedric both hail from Olisvine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow creased.&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s the king of Olisvine-the richest man there and nationwide...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression turned stormy. &#34;So you&#39;re saying Alexander&#39;s already lost the battle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas had been quietly listening in from the living room, a smirk tugging at his lips-the whole conversation sounded utterly absurd to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was helping an outsider to steal his daughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander could be considered a contender,Nikol as thought-why not him? Inside the study, Hamilton yelled in disbelief,&#34;What did you justsay? Repeat that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood poised across from Hamilton. &#34;Dad,I get what&#39;s troubling you. You think Daniela holds too much power, and if she stays with Cedric, she&#39;ll end up threatening McCoy Group&#39;s future. That&#39;s why you&#39;re trying to drive a wedge between them, isn&#39;t it?Then why go through all this trouble with Alexander?I look ten times better than him-no scalpel required.And let&#39;s be honest, you never saw me as heir material for McCoy Group anyway. So why not hand Daniela over to me? She&#39;s got major assets under her name. If she&#39;s bound to me, even when Cedric takes the reins at McCoy Group, she won&#39;t lift a finger against us-out of loyalty to her husband. Makes sense,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was cool and calculated-never once hinting at personal feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew emotions meant nothing to Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Hamilton,only power and profit mattered. Are you out of your mind?&#34; Hamilton recoiled at the boldness. &#34;She&#39;s your brother&#39;s wife! You think you can just take her? What will the world think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Public opinion bends to whoever holds the power. Silencing them would be easy. Besides, giving Alexander a weapon like Daniela is a waste. He&#39;s not half as obedient as l am.Be honest-aren&#39;t I easier for you to handle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas delivered every word with steady confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton went quiet, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could speak, the study door burst open-Charles, his third son, stormed inside. &#34;I don&#39;t agree!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked in shock.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is about looks, I&#39;ve got Nikolas beat hands down! If Daniela&#39;s suddenly up for grabs, count me in -I&#39;m clearly the superior option!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was struck dumb, utterly lost for words.&#34;Are you after her money or herself?&#34;</p>
