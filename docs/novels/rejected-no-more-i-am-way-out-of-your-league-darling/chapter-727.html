                <p>Set aside the matter of making Cedric the successor,Nikolas found his thoughts preoccupied with the mastermind behind the tragic murder of Daniela&#39;s mother and the explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew such devious and merciless deeds were beyond the capabilities of his brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who might it be, then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be someone from the McCoy family.Hamilton? Or one of the elders?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, designated as the future head due to his upbringing, considered this with a perspective broader than his siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A constant worry chewed at him, the fear that Daniela&#39;s arrival could bring disaster to the McCoy family  He had to prevent it from happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Outrageous! Only the five of us brothers have the right to the McCoy family&#39;s fortune!&#34; Nikolas exclaimed with a fierce look at Daniela. &#34;Don&#39;t dare try to sow discord among us. Plus, do you really think they&#39;ll honor their commitments to you? Daniela,they&#39;re not naive. Even if we find the culprit,how can you be sure they&#39;ll remain your allies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced Nikolas with a serene expression and a slight smile. &#34;It seems you don&#39;t understand your brothers, nor do you understand a man&#39;s thirst for power and status.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squinted, his gaze cold as he looked at Daniela, a dangerous glint in his eyes. &#34;I won&#39;t let you succeed. If my father knows your intentions, he won&#39;t allow you into the McCoy family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile grew thin. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly!&#34; Nikolas insisted. &#34;If my father opposes,you will neither join the McCoy family nor ally with my brother! I will lead McCoy Goup in the future.&#34; Annoyed, Daniela had little patience for further discussion. &#34;Then ask your father. Would he oppose or welcome me if I were to join the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas immediately called Hamilton. &#34;Dad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was occupied with a game of goIf,his voice sounding distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxious, Nikolas spoke. &#34;Daniela will accompany Charles to Oiscoll. She harbors ulterior motives, and you must prevent that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Nikolas struggled to hear as Hamilton was away from the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Hamilton&#39;s voice became clearer as he took the phone from his secretary. &#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his years, Nikolas&#39; respect for his father was evident. He responded softly, &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard what you said. Daniela is quite capable, and none of you are allowed to harm her.&#34; Nikolas was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to reply, he heard Hamilton add, &#34;Is Cedric coming back with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas replied, &#34;Apparently not. Daniela and Charles have struck a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause followed on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Hamilton said, &#34;Charles is proving himself quite adept. I assumed it would be Cedric bringing Daniela back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock registered on Nikolas&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Hamilton&#39;s voice carry a note of admiration?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Hamilton silently endorsed the internal discord?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas found himself at a loss, &#39;his thoughts in disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, aren&#39;t you going to intervene? Why let an outsider influence our family affairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton answered with composed authority, &#34;Daniela is Cedric&#39;s spouse, and Cedric is my son Both are family, not outsiders. Nikolas, recall what I&#39;ve taught you. We must harness talent effectively.As the heir apparent, if you cannot sway Daniela,how will you manage Hamilton Group one day? Your vision is too narrow, only seeing personal benefit. Consider the group. Do you realize the potential profit from Daniela collaborating with our group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas opened his mouth, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton pressed on, &#34;Nikolas, if you lack this foresight, then all my efforts in your upbringing have been in vain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood rooted to the spot, struck as if by lightning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela was organizing logistical details for their upcoming journey to Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was also occupied, organizing a pile of cooking equipment.&#34;Don&#39;t forget these necessities; they&#39;re essential for daily cooking,&#34; he instructed, checking off items on a list. &#34;We still need an oven. I had one custom-made at a factory. It&#39;s top-notch and definitely needs to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>come with uIS.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed Cedric&#39;s flurry of activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, too, was watching. She was baffled as to why Cedric, having clearly heard her and Daniela&#39;s conversation, acted as if he hadn&#39;t and continued his preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious to her that Cedric was serious about leaving with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced at Daniela&#39;s unmoved expression and let out a soft sigh.</p>
