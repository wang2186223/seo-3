                <p>Daniela remained composed, her expression giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t upset. She had simply used Alexander&#39;s attention to keep Cedric at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her goal was already accomplished. There was no reason to take things further with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, were you just keeping Cedric at a distance?Is that why you suddenly started talking to me more?&#34;asked Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never bothered to hide her motives,so Alexander had pieced it together when he got home.The thought had left him surprisingly amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But aren&#39;t you two still married? You can keep using me. I really don&#39;t mind,&#34; he offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled,meeting his gaze. &#34;Don&#39;t act like l was the only one who benefited. The world thought we might be getting back together, and that worked out quite well for you, didn&#39;t it? Just the deals I know about are worth over a billion. That doesn&#39;t even include the rise in your company&#39;s stock prices. If we compare gains, you walked away with far more than l did. We both got exactly what we wanted, so why pretend otherwise? Do you think my memory loss makes me easy to fool? You&#39;ve underestimated me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression stiffened. Being called out so bluntly caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed. &#34;I lost my memory, not my wits.I don&#39;t remember what happened in those three years,but people will tell me. So, there&#39;s no need to act like we were particularly close. In business, it&#39;s always better to stand on your own two feet. Or are you not worried about the reputation that comes with profiting off a woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease crossed Alexander&#39;s face. The weight of embarrassment settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Daniela&#39;s return, she had once again proven her sharp business instincts to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone wanted to be associated with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela was unpredictable.She had only shown him favor on a handful of occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,people assumed that with her memory loss,he had a chance to rekindle their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Investors reacted accordingly. Partnerships flourished,and stock prices soared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had done the calculations. From the moment Daniela reappeared to now, Bennett Group had gained over five billion in assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had intended to split the profits with Daniela. A fifty-fifty share seemed fair. He couldn&#39;t bear to give it all away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even a fifty-fifty split seemed too much to Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is already rich. She doesn&#39;t need our small contribution, does she?&#34; Richard had argued. &#34;Besides,if you two remarry, you&#39;ll share the assets anyway.Just forget about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had played dumb the entire time, never expecting Daniela to call him out so directly.Shame burned through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to speak, the auction began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes locked onto Alexander as he moved to sit beside her. She said coolly, &#34;That seat isn&#39;t yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried an icy edge, drawing the attention of those nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated, feeling the weight of their stares.He rubbed the bridge of his nose and said, &#34;Then, I&#39;ll come find you later. You&#39;ve got the wrong idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, he turned and headed to the front row. Daniela shifted her gaze back to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The auction is up there. Why are you looking at me?&#34;Daniela asked Carol a moment later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had been staring at her profile, watching her closely. &#34;Daniela, you just got upset. I haven&#39;t seen you like that in a long time.Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It couldn&#39;t have been about the money.Whether Elite Lux thrived or not, Daniela&#39;s fortune was already staggering. A sum this small meant nothing to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was simple. &#34;Just felt annoyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol tilted her head. &#34;Is it because Alexander was rude to Cedric at the entrance? That&#39;s what got to you,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;CCedric is still your husband,after all. And with so many people watching,Alexander went too far.Daniela,you should remind him who really calls the shots. In Olisvine, we set the rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smile spread across Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Cedric sitting diagonally across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction commenced. Alexander made several high-profile bids. and each time he stood, his gaze instinctively flicked towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around them noticed. It was obvious who he was looking at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained indifferent, sitting composed and unmoved by the attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the final item of the night,&#34; the auctioneer announced.′′Apiece of 17th-century porcelain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A delicate dining bowl was placed under the spotlight,its surface adorned with vivid blossoms that gleamed under the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes lingered on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The starting bid is one million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned to Daniela with a smirk. &#34;Eight million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small bowl, worth no more than five million at best,had just been bid up to an outrageous sumn. Was he insane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer&#39;s eyes gleamed with excitement. &#34;Mr.Bennett! Thank you for your generous bid. Eight million!&#34; Even he had assumed the price wouldn&#39;t go much higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eight million, going once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nine million.&#34; A calm voice rang through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Cedric!&#34; someone whispered in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Fifteen million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained composed. &#34;Twenty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s jaw tightened as he shot Cedric a sharp look. &#34;Twenty-one million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Thirty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Cedric&#39;s offer, the entire hall buzzed with astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they out of their minds? Thirty million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Cedric just throwing money away? This tiny bowl isn&#39;t worth more than five million at best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are Cedric and Alexander even fighting over?Does the bowl have some hidden value we don&#39;t know about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! A showdown between the former and current richest men in the country. Now, this is entertainment!&#34; What a spectacle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned in towards Daniela. &#34;Alexander made over fifty billion off you and thinks buying this little bowl will win your favor. But what about Cedric? |heard Cedric was in a coma for three years, and Phillips Group has been struggling. Dropping this kind of money now must be putting serious pressure on them, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
