                <p>As the first light of dawn spilled into the room, Daniela and her team capped off their marathon session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the night, she had barely acknowledged Caiden and Katrina&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally turned to them, she was taken aback to find them not only still there but also surprisingly chipper.For their age, their vigor seemed to outshine even the younger team members. Their eyes, alive with excitement, were fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office slowly emptied, leaving the trio in a quiet hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was the first to break the silence, setting a breakfast on Daniela&#39;s desk with a flourish of faux affection. &#34;Dear, you must be famished. Eat something.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed the food container, recognizing it instantly as Josie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How cunning-using someone else&#39;s gesture to play the doting father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, her stomach rumbled. After a quick freshening up in the restroom, she returned and opened the container.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cedric reappeared, bearing side dishes to complement her meal. He arranged them meticulously on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she began to eat, Cedric took a seat next to her, his demeanor grave and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, clearly unsettled by Cedric&#39;s imposing aura, paused briefly before attempting a smile. &#34;Cedric,have you eaten yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s reply was icy, his stare piercing as he responded, &#34;I&#39;m not hungry.&#34; His implication was unmistakable-his distaste for the duo was enough to spoil his appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s smile wavered, and he stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric interrupted him sharpoly. &#34;Let her eat first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Katrina recoiled, nodding hurriedly. &#34;Right, right! Eating comes first. We&#39;ll wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been ages since Caiden had shown any paternal concern for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sudden display of warmth only underscored how forced and unnatural it felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, for her part, seemed unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued her meal while Cedric&#39;s glare turned even frostier, fixed intently on Caiden and Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric now embraced his role more boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, as just a friend, he had treaded lightly around Daniela&#39;s personal issues, even his past confrontation with Alexander had been a cautious move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he was more than a friend; he was her suitor-her guardian, her knight. He embraced his duty to protect her without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Cedric&#39;s watchful, authoritative gaze, Caiden and Katrina squirmed like schoolchildren caught in a misdeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained poised,her cool composure unshaken by the unnecessary drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing her breakfast, she closed the lid of the container.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weariness of the all-nighter began to settle in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little emotion, she inquired, &#34;You&#39;ve been here all night. What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shot Caiden a meaningful glance, urging him forward. He plastered on a smile, though it lacked sincerity. &#34;It&#39;s nothing major. I just realized I&#39;ve never really looked around your office before. And I must admit, it&#39;s quite the sight. The layout, the space, and that view-standing at those floor-to-ceiling windows,it feels like Olisvine is at your feet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Kátrina&#39;s nods were overly enthusiastic, her smile painfully forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was unimpressed. &#34;The last time you visited, you were too preoccupied with lecturing me and fishing for favors for Joyce.How could you have noticed the view?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s smile froze. He laughed awkwardly after a tense pause.&#34;Ah,you always had a sharp wit, dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rubbed her eyes, clearly growing weary of the charade.&#34;If you have something to say, say it. I have a meeting this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sighed inwardly, a stark reminde of the demands of wealth-nights rolled into mornings of relentless work. He could never live like that. He preferred a leisurely morning in the garden, basking in the sunshine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, it&#39;s about Joyce-she&#39;s getting married soon. You&#39;re aware of that, right?&#34; Katrina cut in, unable to contain her impatience any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded slightly. &#34;I&#39;m aware.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you&#39;re her sister, don&#39;t you think a small contribution to her wedding would be appropriate? Just as a gesture?&#34; Katrina suggested, her smile straining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela saw right through them. They were here for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood the financial dynamics of Harper Group better than anyone. Since taking the helm, she had overhauled the company,sidelining Caiden completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce isn&#39;t my sister. I was my mother&#39;s only child,&#34; Daniela stated flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression darkened, and he looked as though he might explode, but he caught himself as his gaze met Cedric&#39;s casual yet alert posture, a fruit knife casually in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing his rage, Caiden forced a smile.&#34;Daniela, Joyce is your stepsister. Now that she&#39;s entering a new</p>
