                <p>The buzz around the trending topic was abruptly silenced, erased as swiftly as if it had never graced the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s car was already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled a heavy, silent sigh that seemed to carry the weight of her mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the lingering thoughts, she refocused on the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the weather was throwing a tantrum;hailstones gave way to a relentless onslaught of snow,shrouding the city in an eerie, pristine white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the warm confines of the office, Carol flicked on the heater, providing some comfort against the cold&#39;s bite. She then tucked herself away in a cozy corner,her fingers dancing over her game console,lost in a digital world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued her work with unwavering focus until late into the night. When the clock struck one, she paused and peered out the window, only to find the television tower that usually punctured the skyline swallowed by the snowy night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern for the security guards working downstairs crept into her mind; the biting cold might be too much for them. Deciding to check on them, she descended in the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slid open, she overheard one of the security guards speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, your generosity with the heater is a lifesaver. Without it, I would have been stuck&lt;spending the night in the break room. Ms. Harper had instructed us to lock the building doors and stay inside if it became unbearably cold. However, with all the recent upheavals within the company, our captain insisted we keep our posts as long as possible. Ms. Harper, just back abroad, is overwhelmed with work. We can&#39;t do much, but we&#39;re here to keep watch,&#34; he said with a laugh, a warm snack in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, clad in a dark gray coat and wrapped in a thick scarf, offered a smile. &#34;If you need anything going forward, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. Daniela has a lot on her plate and can&#39;t manage everything on her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard gave a nod, acknowledging the statement. &#34;Of course. Ms. Harper is truly remarkable. When my family was desperate for funds for a surgery,she stepped in to help. Now, thanks to her, my child is thriving in school, and I&#39;m profoundly thankful. I&#39;m at a loss how to ever repay her kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Cedric and offered a warm smile. &#34;Ms.Harper has just returned, and things are a bit chaotic.You&#39;re a resilient man, Mr. Phillips, and you shouldn&#39;t let these matters get to you. It&#39;ll all settle down soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appreciated the security guard&#39;s attempt to lift his spirits. He chuckled. &#34;Of course. Things are actually going quite well now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Daniela was at ease, he found himself satisfied with any circumstance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night stretched on, the chill outside grew piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was fast asleep, snug and warm under the heater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela went downstairs clad in her winter coat,the security guards had already withdrawn to the warmth of the break room, driven away by the biting cold. Cedric had taken up a post in the guard&#39;s chair,his breath visible in the frigid air as he watched the snow flutter down outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to come upstairs and warm up?&#34;Daniela called out from the elevator. Cedric stood, pausing to ask, &#34;Would that be alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded affirmatively. &#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric made his way over, the limp from his leg injury still apparent, causing a slight hitch in his step that required ongoing medication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had stepped into Daniela&#39;s office more times than he could remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning now, after three years, stirred a deep emotional current within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked in, waking Carol and directing her towards the lounge for a more comfortable rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a yawn, Carol shuffled inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office was now a quiet space, occupied only by Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured towards the chair across from her desk. &#34;That used to be your favorite spot, didn&#39;t it?Feel free to sit there, or if you prefer, the sofa is quite comfortable. There&#39;s also a guest room upstairs, but unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the key, so you&#39;ll need to make do here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded, &#34;Please, don&#39;t mind me. Go on with your work; I&#39;m not ready to sleep just yet.&#34; Acknowledging his words with a nod, Daniela turned her attention back to her tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux had once thrived on its innovative and exceptional fashion designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with the company&#39;s influence fading, Daniela was determined to restore its glory through her creative vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the last three years, Elite Lux&#39;s various side businesses had drifted without clear leadership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to streamline these businesses, though that would have to wait until after the upcoming fashion show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt about it; Daniela was swamped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent over her desk, her focus absorbed by the sketches sprawling across the blank paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his quiet corner, Cedric observed her intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been three years since he was this close to /Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed leaner now, her features sharpened by a distinct coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new aura was a blend of distance, indifference,and an almost clinical detachment. She had always worn a faint smile-sometimes real,sometimes an illusion. One moment, she was glowing;the next, her expression dripped with quiet mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite everything, she radiated energy and enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, however, she was serene and mysterious,resembling a tranquil, undisturbed ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric experienced a sharp twinge of sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As breakfast neared, the snow blanketed every inch of Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed Daniela a steaming cup of coffee.&#34;You&#39;re on the mend, but rest is still crucial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set aside her pen and subconsciously massaged her neck. &#34;I know you&#39;ve been hurt too. You don&#39;t need to stay here on my account. There are others around. Nothing will go wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small, somewhat sheepish smile,admitting, &#34;I&#39;m a bit concerned, honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the past three years were a blur, with only a vague image of Cedric&#39;s presence in the corporate sphere. He had been icy, merciless cunning, and distant. Yet the man in front of her bore no resemblance to that image-not the slightest hint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unexpected for Daniela to hear him express concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back in the day,&#34; Daniela began, pausing momentarily.Seeing Cedric&#39;s content expression, a sudden urge to brighten his mood overtook her.&#34;We were quite close,weren&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded firmly, his response resolute.&#34;Absolutely.We were very close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin played on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;You must have really spoiled me back then. Contrary to appearances,I&#39;m not all that soft-hearted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her self-awareness of her own distant and guarded disposition was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chose not to contest her words, simply offering a warm, complicit smile in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comforted by his understanding, Daniela resumed her work, her pen dancing confidently across the paper.Cedric, meanwhile, stole a glance at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time read 8 A.M. He went downstairs to prepare breakfast and handed it to Daniela, who remained deeply engrossed in her sketches, her  concentration unbroken by his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew it was time for him to leave. He pressed his lips together,feeling reluctant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eyed the desk that had once been his sanctuary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his resolve, his feet hesitated to carry him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in a moment of vulnerability, he whispered,&#34;pretended to be pitiful, trying to win your sympathy.&#34;</p>
