                <p>Elyse&#39;s anger finally broke free, her voice sharp and confrontational. &#34;Daniela, isn&#39;t this unfair? Nina is my daughter! Even if Brylee were still alive, she wouldn&#39;t dare to arrange her wedding. What right do you have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice boomed as she clutched Nina&#39;s hair,yanking he along with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina winced, a sharp gasp escaping her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed composed. &#34;Aunt Elyse, I thought you&#39;d forgotten all about my mother. Do you remember how she passed?&#34; She leaned in slightly, a subtle smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s anger stiffened, freezing on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the opportunity of Elyse&#39;s distraction, Nina broke free from her grip and quickly hid behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse snapped, &#34;I&#39;m talking about Nina&#39;s situation.Why bring up Brylee?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle, her smile distant and icy. &#34;I&#39;ve arranged for Nina to marry Sammy.The Harper family is her aunt&#39;s residence, so it&#39;s not out of place for her to marry from here. Plus, she works at Elite Lux, and as her boss, it&#39;s my privilege to send her off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were impeccable, leaving Elyse momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she countered, &#34;But she has her own family. She shouldn&#39;t be marrying from somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled again, her eyes sharp. &#34;Is that so?So, you think Nina should marry from the Dury family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded in agreement, but Nina shook her head firmly,whispering, &#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t want to.&#34; Daniela responded casually, &#34;Alright then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse began to smile, but before it could widen,Daniela continued, &#34;I wonder what kind of wedding gift you&#39;re planning to give Nina. The Wesker family might not care about the sum, but surely you wouldn&#39;t let Nina marry without proper dignity,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s smile completely faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true. You have shares in Harper Group. I&#39;ll have a lawyer draw up a gift contract,transferring those shares to Nina as her dowry. It&#39;s a sign of your family&#39;s responsibility and your deep love for your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly rejected, &#34;No way! Absolutely not!Those are meant for Natalie&#39;s future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Then you have a choice. Either Nina marries from the Harper family with the dowry I provide, or she marries from the Dury family with the dowry you provide. The decision is yours.&#34; Elyse furrowed her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile disappeared. &#34;Or maybe you don&#39;t want to make a choice, refusing to show me this courtesy, and would prefer to cut ties with me.Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s commanding presence was suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was speechless. She hadn&#39;t yet secured Daniela&#39;s assets, so there was no way she could afford to sever ties with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, Elyse reluctantly consented to Nina marrying from the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Elyse cast a cold, detached glance at Nina. &#34;Once you&#39;re married, you&#39;ll be part of another family. The choice is yours. But if things go wrong,don&#39;t come back to me for help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s heart clenched at the coldness of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse departed in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice trembled as she whispered, &#34;Thank you Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;When we were children, my mother favored you. By protecting you now, I&#39;m honoring the affection she had for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day before the wedding, Daniela had to go on a business trip, and Nina left the Harper family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie rushed after her. &#34;Nina, Daniela mentioned that tomorrow is your big day. She asked me to watch over you. It&#39;s chaotic outside, and anything could disrupt the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been staying at the villa for the past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was always generous. Every detail of Nina&#39;s wedding was tailor-made by Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding dress was a unique, one-of-a-kind creation, making Nina appear like the most stunning princess in existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina felt as though she had truly moved beyond the Dury family, embracing her new independenco. &#34;Josie, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m about to get married. My mother won&#39;t do anything extreme. She&#39;s my mother, and she wouldn&#39;t jeopardize an already arranged marriage. It wouldn&#39;t serve her. Besides, when my father was alive, he gave me a gold bracelet. It represents wealth and family legacy, and I&#39;ve kept it safely in the Dury family vault. It&#39;s a precious gift from him, and I want it with me on my wedding day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Nina mentioned her late father, Josie found herself unable to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a second. I&#39;ll call Lillian to arrange bodyguards for your return trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smiled brightly in the sunlight. &#34;It&#39;s fine. l&#39;ve lived with the Dury family long enough. I&#39;ll be back soon. Josie, can you prepare dinner for me? I painted a picture for Daniela. She&#39;s coming back tonight,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina grinned as she got into the car. That night, she intended to tell Daniela the full truth about Brylee&#39;s death, to finally reveal everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina felt as though Daniela was her guiding light.Because of her, she had been able to live a life free from the constraints of living in Natalie&#39;s shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt incredibly fortunate, knowing she would be forever grateful to Daniela.</p>
