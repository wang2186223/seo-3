                <p>Daniela kept her calm. &#34;I&#39;ve moved on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded simply,&#34;Exactly what it sounds like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a slight nod. &#34;And what about you and Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was icy. &#34;That&#39;s none of your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could it not matter? You&#39;re my ex-wife! It&#39;s my responsibility to evaluate the men you pick!&#34; Even Alexander realized how absurd he sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed, said calmly, &#34;I&#39;m perfectly capable of handling it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded again. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s move on. As per our last conversation, you&#39;re handing over the North District deal to settle some old childhood debt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile at his remark.Slowly raising her eyes to meet his, she said, &#34;You and I both know if you were truly that boy from back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face froze, the words striking him harder than he expected. A wave of mortification washed over him, leaving him utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, rooted in place, struggling to muster a response. It felt like an eternity before he finally managed to lift his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single, fleeting glance was all Daniela needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now,she had her doubts, but in this moment,she knew for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile turned cold, almost mocking.&#34;Alexander, you&#39;ve really let me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were slightly red as she spoke, but it wasn&#39;t because of Alexander. It was the weight of the unwavering commitment she had poured into everything over the past ten years, the years that now felt as if they had been erased in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela turned and began walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed rooted in place, his eyes locked on her retreating figure, watching her slowly fade into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her figure was about to disappear, panic surged through him. He yelled desperately, &#34;Daniela! Stop being so difficult! You&#39;re just making excuses to hold on to that North District contract. I am the boy from ten years ago. I helped you out of your depression,and you owe me for the rest of your life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s words rang out, but Daniela simply kept walking,unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struck by her indifference, Alexander took a few staggered steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists tightened, the pressure of panic flooding his chest. The realization hit him like a jolt-he was terrified that Daniela might never come back, that he had already lost her for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything he&#39;d hidden-his lies, his motives-were now exposed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regarded him coldly, as though he were nothing more than a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride coursed through Alexander&#39;s veins, and he couldn&#39;t bear to accept the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and stumbled off, unable to face the truth any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric,waiting in the private room,finally emerged after a while. He caught the tail end of Alexander&#39;s shouting, but the creak of the door behind him drowned out the rest of the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t make out what Alexander had been yelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the bits he could hear, it sounded like it had something to do with events from a decade ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela walked in, and he asked, &#34;Was Alexander here? What was all that shouting about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened the door to the private room, her voice calm. &#34;Don&#39;t mind him. He&#39;s just being his usual over-the-top self.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there had been even the faintest trace of feeling for Alexander before, it was gone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bring herself to remember the time wasted on him over the past ten years. She was too sharp to get lost in the past; she understood the importance of moving forward, of never looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Richard was already in high spirits,celebrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was how things had always gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how ridiculous Alexander&#39;s requests were,Daniela would always cave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was just a contract-hardly a challenge for Daniela to refuse. The idea of Daniela becoming his daughter-in-law again brought Richard a great sense of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela remarried Alexander, Elite Lux would be completely under his control. She would stay at home,raising kids and supporting her husband, while Alexander would take over Elite Lux gradually. By the time she noticed, Elite Lux would already be entirely in the hands of the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that point, who could compete with Bennett Group in the entire country?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had been eagerly awaiting this moment for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled to himself, but his laughter was cut short when the front door suddenly swung open, and Alexander stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling, Richard looked at him and asked, &#34;When are you heading to Elite Lux to sign the contract?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, frustrated, yanked at his tie as he explained what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s brow furrowed as he quickly asked, &#34;After you yelled all that,how did Daniela react?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes dropped, his mind still racing with confusion and panic. &#34;She ignored me. I&#39;m not event Boy sure if she heard me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had changed so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, her emotions were always clear,easy for him to read. Now, he couldn&#39;t even tell what she was feeling,let alone her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard squinted, his voice low. &#34;Then she&#39;s still unsure.I&#39;ll figure something out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s grip tightened as he replayed the image of Daniela in the corridor over and over, feeling helpless to change anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have seen right through him.Otherwise,why would she be so distant and cold? 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard took a long drag from his cigarette before turning to Alexander. &#34;The secret spot in the tree Daniela talked about... Was it at the Harper family&#39;s villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a brief nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard fell silent for a moment, then spoke. &#34;Since that&#39;s where everything happened, there might still be clues there. Daniela&#39;s room could have some traces left. No one else is competing for the role of the boy from that year, so if you say the right things, you can win her over!&#34; Even if Alexander couldn&#39;t convince her, at least she wouldn&#39;t completely reject him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander needed to act quickly and remarry her before Daniela realized everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After remarriage, everything would be much simpler.Her assets would become Alexander&#39;s, and the Bennett family could take control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having made up his mind, Richard quickly reached out to Katrina, telling her that he wanted to pay them a visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, excited by the unexpected news, assumed Richard was coming to talk about the marriage between Alexander and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was thrilled by the thought of it and eagerly opened the door, ready to welcome the Bennett family with open arms.</p>
