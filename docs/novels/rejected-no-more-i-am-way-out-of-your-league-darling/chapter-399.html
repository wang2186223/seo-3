                <p>Lately,Doug had become more and more ruthless in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was reaching her breaking point, but what could she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money. That was the reason she had no escape.Doug&#39;s wealth held her in place, a gilded cage she couldn&#39;t bear to leave. She&#39;d rather endure his torment than return to poverty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the point of ambition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should dignity matter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had once walked with his head high, but now,he was forcedto swallow his pride and beg for scraps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated, Alexander left Joyce&#39;s place, barely able to hold himself together. Before long, his car pulled up at the base of the Elite Lux building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guards,upon seeing him,made it clear he wasn&#39;t welcome. They refused to let him see Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the argument escalated, Lillian appeared, carrying ray of coffee. Her gaze landed on him, a smirk ling on her lips. &#34;Alexander, is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a frosty voice, Alexander responded, &#34;I must speak ith Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>llian&#39;s disdain was evident. &#34;Why? Failed to achieve our aims with Joyce and now you turn to Daniela?lexander, consider your actions. You&#39;re selling ourself now, aren&#39;t you? Just like a gigolo. Joyce has een telling everyone that you&#39;re available for ten thousand a night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Alexander&#39;s face. &#34;Does Daniela know about this?&#34; he asked, desperate for some remaining affection from her. &#34;Cedric&#39;s in a coma.I could possibly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could you possibly offer? Alexander, do you really think you can entertain fantasies about our boss&#39;s wife?&#34; An executive from Phillips Group, a recent regular at Elite Lux, overheard and exploded in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive&#39;s fist connected with Alexander&#39;s face,and the sound of his nose breaking resonated through the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Head bowed, Alexander watched blood drip from his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped it away roughly, the pain intense. Despite wanting to retaliate, his attention shifted when Daniela walked through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her, he momentarily forgot his agony. He wanted to break through the crowd to reach her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His desire was to beg her, to see if she would even glance his way once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he was determined to value her as Cedric did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander longed to propose to Daniela that, with Cedric&#39;s absence, perhaps he could fill his shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a multitude of things he wished to express to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His desire was to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Lillian,the security staff,and the executives from Phillips Group were quicker to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They encircled Alexander comnpletely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s retreating figure was all he could see as she mingled and laughed with investors, stepping into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, he found himself sinking to the floor,treated no better than slime underfoot. Yet,Alexander did not depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained seated, adamant about catching a glimpse of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he needed to act now, or once Cedric recuperated, any chance with Daniela would vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As darkness fell, Alexander&#39;s eyes stayed glued to the elevator doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passerby commented cheerily, &#34;Daniela truly adores Cedric. Despite her hectic agenda, she makes daily hospital visits and even stays overnight. A prestigious global medical team is looking after him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Alexander rose unsteadily, clutching the speaker. &#34;Has Daniela alreadyleft?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person answered, &#34;Yes, she departed after the afternoon&#39;s engagements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s grip on the speaker&#39;s clothing loosened and dropped. &#34;She&#39;s gone? Already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard materialized beside Alexander, his expression tense. &#34;Why not follow her? The hospital is far more accessible than here at Elite Lux. What are you so afraid of? Alexander, what have you got to lose? Go,plead with Daniela. Kneel if you must, and confess that you seek only her companionship,ready to stand in for Cedric. Daniela values loyalty. If you shed your  pride,she might just reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring vacantly, Alexander turned to Richard. &#34;Do I still have a chance?&#34;</p>
