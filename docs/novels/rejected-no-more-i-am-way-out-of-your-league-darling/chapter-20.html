                <p>Richard, upon noticing Alexander&#39;s silence, resumed speaking, his voice tinged with his customary self-assuredness. &#34;Joyce called today. She&#39;s set her sights on the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. I&#39;ve given her your nod. Spin this as your chance to engage Daniela. She&#39;ll feel jealous, no doubt, so take advantage of that to reconcile. As for the Harper family, save yourself the trouble of mediating.Daniela&#39;s fortune outshines theirs by far. With her backing Bennett Group, we&#39;ve no need for the Harper family&#39;s leftovers. Caiden&#39;s declaration of cutting ties with Daniela publicly was his most foolish move yet.He&#39;s become the laughingstock. If I were in his position, I would make every effort to win back her favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard rose from his seat, laying down his strategy for Alexander with a sagely nod. &#34;In the past, Daniela was merely one of many smitten with you, relentlessly pursuing your attention. Now, her circumstances have changed dramatically. It&#39;s imperative you take her seriously now. Yet, tread lightly; no one admires a sycophant-it&#39;s disgraceful and fruitless. Entice her-offer just enough to keep her intrigued, but withhold enough to keep her yearning. The essence of desire is to chase what remains elusive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s advice was delivered with the weight of a seasoned strategist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained stoic, his face an unreadable mask. 5</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, buoyed by Richard&#39;s assurance, was already acting as if the three floors of the Luxor Tower were hers by right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before any official announcement, she gathered her friends for a tour of what she already viewed as her future property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard, taken aback by the commanding presence of her group, hesitated only momentarily before allowing them passage.  Joyce&#39;s smugness blossomed further as she faced her circle of friends. With a triumphant air, she declared,&#34;See? There&#39;s nothing beyond my reach!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alma Herrera lingered by the window, her eyes wide with admiration for the panoramic view from the 18th floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, you&#39;re amazing. This is the most sought-after building in Olisvine. You requested these floors, and Daniela just gave them to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puffing up her chest, Joyce flashed a confident smirk.&#34;Naturally! I&#39;m pampered by everyone-no one dares defy me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words ignited a wave of supportive cheers from her group, each member flashing her an enthusiastic thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basking in their admiration, Joyce gestured to the nearby security guard, her voice smooth and commanding as she asked him to bring them some water. She then swept her hand grandly towards the seating area, inviting them to find themselves comfortable spots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Joyce, didn&#39;t your stepfather cut all ties with Daniela? How on earth is she still bending over backwards to grant you such a prime spot? They say even piles of cash can&#39;t open doors here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truly, Joyce, you outshine even the most privileged heirs of the wealthy families!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does this mean the Harper family&#39;s entire fortune will be yours one day? And didn&#39;t you mention the Bennett family was the one who made this possible?So does that mean Alexander&#39;s father has a soft spot for you too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tilted her chin slightly, her lips curling into a self-satisfied smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, absolutely! Do you even know how incredible Joyce is? She&#39;s not just some heiress-she&#39;s the heiress! The epitome of class and power!&#34; Alma gestured dramatically, her voice rising with each word as though proclaiming the arrival of royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flattery washed over Joyce like a warm wave,her ego swelling visibly as she soaked up the praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back slightly, a hand casually brushing her hair, preparing to deliver a smug remark to keep the admiration flowing. But then, the soft chime of the elevator arriving pierced through the chatter, silencing the group instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew heavy with anticipation as the doors glided open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped into view, her figure draped in an exquisite, limited-edition Elite Lux autumn outfit that hugged her with flawless precision. Her heels clicked against the polished floor, each step deliberate,exuding a regal confidence that turned every head in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was like a flower blooming in the wild-breathtakingly beautiful but undeniably distant, an untouchable force of nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was holding the building&#39;s design draft as she stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted in her tracks, her eyes widening as she took in the group of people gathered on the 18th floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheerful expression slowly drained from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the security guard, who had just emerged from the elevator with a tray laden with beverages,Daniela inquired, &#34;How did they manage to come up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group that had followed Joyce upstairs was keen to use her as a bridge to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela had ascended to the position of CEO of Elite Lux and was rapidly becoming a prominent figure in the national business arena. Many were eager to forge ties with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her unwelcoming demeanor, they huddled around Joyce, offering Daniela their most ingratiating smiles.&#34;Hello,Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face remained stoic; she was not one to lash out at those who approached her with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,she recognized every single one of them-these were the very women who had scorned her in the past, mocking her for being overlooked by Alexander.Their derisive laughter and scornful glances were etched in her mind. Now,they acted as if they were good friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing up here?&#34; Daniela demanded,cutting straight to the chase, dispensing with any semblance of cordiality.</p>
