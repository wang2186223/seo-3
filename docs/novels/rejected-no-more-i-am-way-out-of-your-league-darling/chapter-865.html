                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes flew wide, raw disbelief flooding his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying? Are you suggesting my father set me up? You think he played some kind of mind game with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked with anger and denial. &#34;That&#39;s impossible. He told me this project was beneath him -he mocked me for even bothering with it. Why would he ridicule me and then turn around and compete for the same deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung stubbornly to his faith. &#34;He&#39;s my father No matter what happens between us, at the very least,we&#39;d compete fair and square. There&#39;s no way he&#39;d...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela unlocked her phone, tapped quickly, and slid it across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; words trailed off as he glanced down &#34;Besides, he told me to go home and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he saw it: McCoy Group&#39;s name right there on the bidding results. In that moment, Nikolas&#39; world seemed to tilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas fixed his eyes on the results, a wave of  despair crashed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy,sick lump formed in his throat. He stared at the screen, suddenly unable to swallow another bite</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he stood and stormed out, heading straight for his father&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he burst in, he showed the bidding results to Hamilton. His voice shook with hurt and fury as he demanded, &#34;Dad, what is this supposed to mean?Didn&#39;t you say McCoy Group had no interest in a small project like this? Yet you reviewed my cost estimate -and now your final bid is just one dollar higher than mine You&#39;re not just humiliating yourself. You&#39;re humiliating me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; world shattered, leaving him numb with disappointment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had pinned all his hopes on this one victory.desperate to prove himself, but in the end, the person he trusted most had betrayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton snorted, his tone dripping with arrogance &#34;This is what it means when people say all&#39;s fair in love and war. You&#39;re still so naive. How can you expect to survive in business? You need to leam to watch your back. Haven&#39;t I taught you anything after all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas returned, having gained nothing but a reprimand from Hamilton, feeling utterly defeated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot a pointed look at Daniela and asked quietly.&#34;He&#39;s just been humiliated. Are you going to do something about it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze lingered on Nikolas, but she offered no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Nikolas came to find Daniela,who was watching TV in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is all on me,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;I never saw it coming. I let you down, and I wasted Cedric&#39;s hard work. I&#39;m sorry for letting everyone down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded utterly defeated, a shadow of the ambitious man he&#39;d tried to become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied him. &#34;You think you let us down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked up, startled by her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;You didn&#39;t let us down-you let yourself down.You threw away all those hours of hard work. But if you can take this loss and turn it into a lesson, it won&#39;t have been for nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had no answer. The weight of her words settled heavily on his heart. leaving him lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot him a cool look, chin tilted in mild annoyance. &#34;Alright, go entertain yourself. You&#39;re blocking my view.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, not sure what to make of her attitude.&#34;That&#39;s it? You&#39;re just letting it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh slipped from Daniela. &#34;What else do you want? Should I rough you up instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conflicted, Nikolas hovered in the doorway,torn between embarrassment and relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing him another glance, Daniela fixed her attention on the TV. &#34;I&#39;ve said everything that needed saying. There&#39;s no use repeating myself. Besides,your father hijacking your bid only proves he sees your worth-whether he admits it or not. He talks a big game, but trust me, he&#39;s watching you. Take the warning, learn from it, and move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked the remote and switched the channel with a flick of her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lingered in the living room, wrestling with his emotions, then finally steeled himself and stormed out the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped from Daniela as he vanished</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Cedric barely looked up from his business book, engrossed as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned in to Daniela, dropping her voice. &#34;We&#39;ve traced your mother&#39;s last trip before she died-she went to Oiscoll. She even visited the McCoy family and saw Hamilton!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of steel lit up Daniela&#39;s gaze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,catching the shift in her expression, asked.&#34;Should we tell Cedric about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced thoughtfully at Cedric, weighing her options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been relentlessly exploiting every vulnerability among McCoy Group&#39;s shareholders,landing each blow with surgical precision and leaving himself barely a moment to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to involve him. Just set up a meeting with Hamilton for me first.&#34; Daniela&#39;s tone was steady.her mind already a step ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was ready to respond, but her phone vibrated with a new message. Glancing down. she spotted a new message from the secretary about an appointment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she passed the phone to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed as she read the screen.Hamilton had invited her to meet tomorrow at noon -right when Cedric would be tied up with his big press conference. Carol huffed disdainfully, &#34;He picked that time on purpose so Cedric couldn&#39;t tag along, didn&#39;t he?What&#39;s his game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wry smile curled on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;Hamilton used to look down on Cedric, didn&#39;t care what Cedric thought.Now he finally sees Cedric as a threat. He wants to confront me without Cedric there to back me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric was around,how could Hamilton say those threatening words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol rolled her eyes in exasperation. &#34;Hamilton is so cunning! He really is the worst. Let&#39;s just refuse to meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never taking her eyes off the TV, Daniela answered nonchalantly, &#34;Tell the secretary I&#39;ll meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton cared about saving face in front of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Daniela, she didn&#39;t want Cedric tangled up in petty power plays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol straightened up, determination flashing in her eyes. &#34;Alright then! Tomorrow,we&#39;ll show Hamilton exactly what we&#39;re made of.</p>
