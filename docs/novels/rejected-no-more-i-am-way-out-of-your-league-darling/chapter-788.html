                <p>Resentment still simmered beneath Hamilton&#39;s composed exterior. The string of humiliations he&#39;d suffered at Daniela&#39;s hands hadn&#39;t faded from memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he had a chance to reclaim some dignity in front of her-and he wasn&#39;t about to let that slip awvay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not. If Daniela doesn&#39;t come, then Cedric shouldn&#39;t bother showing up either,&#34; Hamilton said flatly, his voice leaving no room for debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead before the secretary could reply.He stared at the silent screen, lips pressed into a tight line, and let out a sigh of resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging his feet a little, he made his way back to Cedric, forcing a polite smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes.&#34;Mr. McCoy, your father wants both you and your wife to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Nikolas scowled the second he heard it.&#34;Why bring her into this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his father going to welcome both Cedric and Daniela into the family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining friendly, the secretary turned to Cedric. &#34;Since Daniela is your wife, it only makes sense for her to meet your father, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric caught the angle Hamilton was playing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face hardened into a cold, unreadable expression.&#34;So he&#39;s using this as an excuse to provoke her. That&#39;s what this is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, the secretary found himself speechless. He hadn&#39;t expected Cedric to be quite this sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to smooth things over, he replied, &#34;Why would he do that? You&#39;re his family. There&#39;s no reason for him to create conflct. Maybe just take a moment to change and ask your wife to come down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t budge. &#34;No need. Go back and tell Hamilton I have no intention of joining the McCoy family. And I&#39;ll never allow anyone to put my wife in a difficult position. If that&#39;s all, you can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Cedric turned and climbed the stairs, disappearing into his workspace while the others stood frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the street, Hamilton instinctively glanced toward the building, expecting to see Cedric emerge Instead,only the secretary and the stiff-faced McCoy brother remained in view. Realizing Cedric was nowhere in sight, Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed. He snatched up his phone and redialed, this time with far less patience. &#34;What the hell is taking so long? It&#39;s just a change of clothes! Is he really going to make this into some dramatic spectacle? Do l need to walk over there myself and drag him out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the secretary muttered to himself,&#34;You might actually have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully choosing his words, he spoke in a low tone.&#34;Mr. McCoy, Cedric just told me he won&#39;t be joining the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sprang to his feet, voice thundering across the room. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around him, murmurs rose and heads turned. The quiet cafe quickly filled with curious stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not bothering to lower his voice,Hamilton shouted again, &#34;He said what? Cedric&#39;s refusing me? Has he lost his damn mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the secretary had to admit-Cedric&#39;s response had taken him by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s exactly what Cedric said, sir,&#34; the secretary replied, his tone cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing his eyes briefly, Hamilton clenched his jaw.&#34;Where is he now? Put him on the phone.&#34; With a sigh, the secretary answered, &#34;He&#39;s already gone upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s teeth ground together as he struggled to maintain his composure. &#34;This is about Daniela, isn&#39;t it?He&#39;s throwing away everything because I asked her to be here? How absurd! Fine Tell Cedric that Daniela doesn&#39;t need to come. He can come alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary recognized it as Hamilton&#39;s version of backing down. Unfortunately, the damage was already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I think I may not have been clear earlier,&#34; the secretary said gently. &#34;Cedric wasn&#39;t just objecting to Daniela&#39;s presence. He meant every word. Whether she joins or not doesn&#39;t matter-he has no intention of returning to the McCoy family. He doesn&#39;t want the title He doesn&#39;t want to acknowledge you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was stunned. He doubted if he heard correctly &#34;Come again?&#34; &#34;Mr. McCoy, it really seems like Cedric has no interest in the family fortune. From everything I&#39;ve seen, his words were sincere. He truly doesn&#39;t want any of it Not the name, not the wealth, not the legacy&#34; The secretary felt the urge to suggest that Hamilton might have misunderstood something.</p>
