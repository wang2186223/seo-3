                <p>Daniela took a bite of the breakfast, chewing without much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden began to eat the rest andasked Cedric, &#34;This is amazing! Where&#39;d you buy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze followed Daniela as she disappeared up the stairs, laptop in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Caiden, eyebrows raised. &#34;What was that about earlier? The wealthiest family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden choked mid-bite, the food lodged uncomfortably in his throat. After coughing for a while,he said, &#34;I said nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, sensing something off, narrowed his eyes.&#34;This got anything to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden froze, jaw slack in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He attempted a quick getaway, but Cedric&#39;s voice,laced with quiet menace, stopped him cold. &#34;If my wife can take someone down, so can l.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden looked ready to weep. &#34;Come on, have mercy!You both treat me like the weakest link and keep ganging up on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he took off like a startled rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric squinted, lost in thought, his gaze lingering on the animated show Daniela had left playing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, his attention drifted to Jack,happily lost in his toys on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned downstairs, she found Cedric in the kitchen, side by side with Ruth, cooking.She had never met a man so effortlessly domestic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t the type to frequent bars, brag about his achievements, or waste hours socializing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he found contentment in quiet routines cooking up meals, washing fruit for her, tending to the garden.Simple things, yet strangely reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric is truly remarkable,&#34; Caiden remarked. Ever since discovering Cedric was Hamilton&#39;s eldest son,he had grown even fonder of Cedric. &#34;He moves seamlessly between the boardroom and the kitchen,yet never asks anything of you. If your mother were still here, she would be proud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been years since Caiden had willingly brought up Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head,studying him curiously. Caiden went on, &#34;A real man shoulders responsibility so his wife has someone to lean on. Cedric has that,and he treasures you. That&#39;s all that really matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back into the plush sofa, saying nothing. Her gaze flickered to the television, now tuned to the same channel that had just aired Hamilton&#39;s interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes clouded over, lingering in deep thought before drifting toward Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux&#39;s grand fashion show wrapped up abruptly,catching many off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most assumed the show had ended because Elite Lux had already hit Daniela&#39;s ambitious sales targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in her office, with a steely gaze and fingers tapping rhythmically on her desk, Daniela was plotting something far bigger-relocating Elite Lux&#39;s Olisvine branch to Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement sent shockwaves through the entire industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions flooded in, and among them, Caiden,grinning, asked, &#34;If you&#39;re moving, what happens to this villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up. &#34;Cedric and I went through our share of struggles after marriage. Consider this villa my way of making it up to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression soured. &#34;And your other properties in Olisvine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips parted. &#34;Those too...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could complete her sentence, Carol stepped in, her voice low as she leaned toward Daniela. &#34;Daniela, urgent news-Hamilton is set to name one of his five children as his heir. They&#39;ve been assigned a city to develop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes sharpened as she turned to Carol.&#34;Which city?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol replied, &#34;Here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux had been set to relocate, but now, that plan was suddenly in limbo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news sent the public into a haze of uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sat off to the side, unusually silent, emotions buried beneath a carefully composed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,he had asked Daniela what she would leave him once she left the country. She hadn&#39;t given a direct answer, but her silence had spoken volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no sentiment for their father-daughter relationship, nor any intention of leaving him a single asset. To Daniela, he had never been a father-only a tool in her relentless pursuit of her mother&#39;s killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Caiden had foolishly believed that time might soften Daniela&#39;s heart, that she might come to care for him. But he had miscalculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was as unyielding as ever-frozen,unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization settling in, Caiden knew it was time to stop waiting for scraps and start securing his own future.</p>
