            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A hush swept over the room, stretching into a tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye locked onto Daniela, Hamilton&#39;s included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usually composed expression fractured into disbelief as he turned to her and demanded, &#34;Have you lost your mind? Bidding up by fifty million every time? Does your company print money now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a light laugh, her tone breezy. &#34;Come on, Mr. McCoy, you must be joking. It&#39;s just a pair of cufflinks, a simple gift for my husband. Do you really think I&#39;d need to mint cash for something so trivial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression soured, his jaw tight. &#34;So young, and yet so reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning surprise, Daniela tilted her head. &#34;Reckless? Over an amount like this? Aren&#39;t you exaggerating?Wait, are you thinking of dropping out? That&#39;d make this a whole lot less interesting. Why not raise the stakes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s grip on his paddle tightened until his knuckles blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, his secretary leaned in and whispered urgently, &#34;Sir, let&#39;s not risk the company&#39;s finances over a rivalry. Three hundred and fifty million could buy a vault full of cufflinks. There&#39;s no need to go any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a stiff smile, Hamilton swallowed his pride. &#34;Daniela, since you&#39;re so fond of them, I&#39;ll let you have them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of shock passed through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s giving up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll have to swvallow his pride after this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All thatbragging about owning every cufflink on earth-look at him now! Isn&#39;t that humiliating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tides are turning in Oiscoll. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Daniela&#39;s company replaces McCoy Group at the top before long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant those comments landed, Hamilton&#39;s jaw clenched so tightly, a vein pulsed at his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Daniela a look of pure fury, then strode out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Nikolas stared in disbelief, murmuring, &#34;l&#39;ve never seen my father this rattled. Daniela, you&#39;re something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, unfazed by Nikolas&#39; awe, strode up to the stage. Before the assembled business elite and the entire Oiscoll press, she reached into the glass case, retrieved the cufflinks, and pinned them onto Cedric&#39;s lapel with quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Oiscoll&#39;s social circles erupted with gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I were Cedric! Where do you even find a wife like Daniela? She&#39;d move heaven and earth for her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three hundred and fifty million-just to pin something on his suit? My god.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not just expensive, they&#39;re on a different level.&#39;Cedric&#39;s never looked more distinguished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s got him wrapped around her finger. Cedric&#39;s never leaving her, not in this lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only someone would spoil me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Romance seemed to swirl through every corner of Oiscoll that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was the talk of every social media channel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very top, one headline blazed brighter than the rest. &#34;Daniela&#39;s Power!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every corner of Oiscoll saw Daniela&#39;s might on display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had seen it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy gnawed at him on the ride home with Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind kept circling back to the mind-boggling bank balance she&#39;d flashed. He felt like a complete idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer number of zeroes had made his head spin. His curiosity piqued, he pressed Carol on how many zeros were in the total.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol answered with a smile, &#34;Never bothered to count. It&#39;s enough to buy out McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, still reeling, tried to mask his embarrassment. &#34;Is it even safe to keep that much in one account?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s lips curved in amusement. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s Daniela&#39;s bank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her phone again. The words &#34;Eternal Vista Bank&#34; stared back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that the same place McCoy Group kept all its funds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a single word from Daniela, every penny McCoy Group had in that bank could be at her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt like the universe was mocking him. First he saw himself as the fool, then Hamilton, and then the whole McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more pointless it felt to return home. No matter how hard he tried, Daniela would always be leagues ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hope and desperation tangled in his voice, he approached Daniela with almost childlike eagerness.&#34;Can you take me in? Like Carol and the others-I want to know your bank balance, have access to your second card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the life he craved: respect, freedom, and a bottomless supply of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he saw the possibility of leaving Hamilton&#39;s shadow and the humiliation that came with it.Maybe he didn&#39;t have to be Hamilton&#39;s puppet anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Daniela could get a word out, Cedric stepped in, his eyes narrowing with unmistakable menace as he slid protectively in front of her.&#34;Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas wanted to steal his wife,peek at her funds, and utilize her second card? Over his dead body.</p>
