                <p>The moment Daniela descended the stairs, her icy,aloof demeanor extinguished Caiden&#39;s tentative smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting second, he contemplated chastising her,yet his attention diverted to Cedric, who was firmly planted in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No longer engrossed in his phone, Cedric nonetheless seemed rooted to the spot, exhibiting no signs of departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concealing his iritation, Caiden managed a polite smile and turned to Cedric. &#34;Mr. Phillips, now that Daniela has joined us, was there something particular you wished to discuss with her? Perhaps you could have a word with her first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lazy stretch, Cedric settled deeper into his seat his voice smooth and unhurried. &#34;We&#39;re set for lunch later. There&#39;s no need to rush. You two chat-I&#39;ll stay out of the way. When you&#39;re finished, I&#39;ll take her along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His insinuation was unmistakable: he wasn&#39;t leaving anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,suppressing his annoyance, shot Cedric a wary glance before facing Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle yet undeniable edge of criticism colored his voice this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable, Daniela. Getting up this late? With your pathetic work ethic, it&#39;s a joke that you&#39;re even running a business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela delayed her response, instead strolling into the kitchen and serving herself a glass of milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a brief glance at Katrina and then Joyce,a smile danced on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed to perfection and carrying an air of unshakable authority, Daniela returned to the living room and settled elegantly into the cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m laughing because I&#39;m dying to know-what bullshit plan are you cooking up this time?&#34; Her tone dripped with sarcasm, a subtle smirk on her lips accentuating her clear disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice hardened, his eyes narrowing with a warning edge. &#34;Mind your words!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Daniela retorted, &#34;If my memory serves me right, you were the one who publicly declared our father-daughter ties cut. It was in the newspapers,wasn&#39;t it?Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten.  It&#39;s understandable,given your lovely new wife and darling daughter are now in the picture. Don&#39;t worry-I saved a screenshot of that announcement. Would you like to see it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression tensed visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Daniela pressed on. &#34;Since we&#39;re nothing to each other anymore,let me ask-what twisted logic made you think bringing your pathetic family into my home was okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze briefly swept over to the housekeeper and then to the movers. &#34;You&#39;ve hit my staff and started seizing my possessions. So, I must ask-what is this,if not daylight robbery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping up,Joyce interjected sharply, &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t twist it into something terrible! We&#39;re taking your stuff because you actually matter to us!&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s frosty expression didn&#39;t waver as she fixed her piercing eyes on Joyce. &#34;Oh, really? Should I applaud you for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Joyce stumbled, her composure cracking like fragile glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping in, Katrina coaxed, &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re being overly harsh. I understand you&#39;re hurt because your father declared he&#39;s cutting ties with you,but consider his age-he can be rash at times. Do you truly want to cling to resentment? Bonds between father and daughter aren&#39;t so easily dissolved by a mere public statement. You&#39;ve been part of the Harper family for over twenty years-don&#39;t pretend you made it all on your own. Let&#39;s not ruin family ties with needless stubbornness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was the epitome of hypocrisy-sweet on the surface,venomous underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of her duplicity, Caiden absorbed only the words that suited his narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He truly thought Katrina was the peacemaker of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression hardened further, his eyes locking on Daniela with a freezing intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, she was nothing more than a spoiled brat who didn&#39;t know how to appreciate a damn thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, was no stranger to Katrina&#39;s manipulations. She lifted her hand, signaling an end to the discussion. &#34;Stop pretending this was all some impulsive mistake. Let&#39;s face it,Dad-you couldn&#39;t wait to cut me loose, could you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was obsessed with his image, and the idea of eating his words, especially with Cedric watching,was utterly humiliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To concede a mistake in such a scenario was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression grew darker, a storm brewing in his eyes. As he parted his lips to protest, Katrina slid gracefully into the seat next to him, her fingers lightly pressing his, and whispered, &#34;If we upset Daniela, how will we convince her to give those floors to Joyce?She&#39;s your daughter. What&#39;s the point of holding a grudge against her? After all these years of raising her,would you really want to see all your efforts go to waste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s jaw tightened, a visible tremor of frustration rippling through him. &#34;Are you suggesting I should just submit to her demands now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serene smile, Katrina embodied both innocence and empathy. &#34;She&#39;s your daughter. Is it really that demeaning to yield a little for her? But if the thought is too bitter for you, allow me to be the peacemaker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising with deliberate grace, Katrina bent forward into a deep, respectful bow. &#34;Daniela, I accept the blame for everything that has transpired. As your stepmother,I&#39;ve let you down. Please, don&#39;t punish your father for my mistakes. I see youI&#39;re upset, and I want to apologize. I&#39;m sorry. Can we move past this and focus on what&#39;s ahead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, soft and pleading, was laden with feigned self-abnegation. She assumed the guise of a benevolent,loving stepmother with flawless precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, observing this, was overwhelmed with a rush of pride and tenderness for Katrina. His heart swelled with appreciation for her display of &#34;kindness,&#34; and he made a silent promise to himself to provide even greater support for her and Joyce in the coming days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they, so innocent and righteous, livein this dangerous world without him watching over them?</p>
