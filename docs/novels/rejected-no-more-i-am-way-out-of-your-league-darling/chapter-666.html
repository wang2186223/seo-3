                <p>Cedric&#39; subordinate, Mose, called Cedric, his voice shaking with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, there&#39;s about 50 people lurking outside.If your wife sees them, she&#39;s going to be terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked over at Daniela, who was casually playing a game, and said calmly from the garden,&#34;She has nothing to fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was unaware of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was prepared to defend them if the intruders dared to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Mose hesitated, his voice tense. &#34;Boss, I&#39;m really worried. These mercenaries are known for their ruthlessness. Even if every one of us in Lone Wolf teamed up, we probably wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Cedric stepped in as Lone Wolf&#39;s leader,he&#39;d regretted steering the group into the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were all sharp-witted businessmen, but their edge-the skills they once relied on-had long faded. After spending so much time peacefully, they had lost their sharpness in combat. Out of shape and far removed from their former strength, how could they possibly hold their ground against trained mercenaries?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric massaged his temples. &#34;I&#39;ll put up one hundred million. Find someone capable of protecting my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose exhaled deeply on the phone. &#34;Right now, only the Cealmaur could handle them. I&#39;ll see if I can get in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;If I recall correctly, the leader of Cealmaur has never losta fight. Do you think you can bring them in for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul gasped in disbelief. &#34;Boss, we&#39;re talking about the legendary head of the mercenaries. Are you certain about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the glass window, Cedric observed Daniela absorbed in her game and said, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose responded,&#34;A hundred million might not suffice to hire them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric considered hisfinances. &#34;Then I&#39;ll offer all I have. Make it happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose clucked his tongue and replied, &#34;Boss, you&#39;re</p>
                
                
                
                <p>quite the romantic. But what if you end up broke? Will your wife still stand by you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric laughed softly. &#34;Then I&#39;ll stick by her,wash the dishes, cook her meals, and be her devoted slave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was engrossed in her game when a message popped up on her phone. It was from Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,does Cedric still notknow who you really are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a question mark,puzzled.She then resumed her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing a round, Daniela went back to check her messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several messages had already come through from Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re the leader of Cealmaur, does he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lone Wolf contacted us, wanting the leader of Cealmauur to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that funny? Cedric is willing to pay to keep you safe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked how much they&#39;re offering. They mentioned Cedric is ready to liquidate his entire fortune, which amounts to about a hundred billion.&#34; &#34;Daniela,what should I tell them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reading the messages, Daniela looked over at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then lowered her head and replied, &#34;Say it&#39;s possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came quickly. &#34;Really? Daniela,what are you suggesting? Do you want Cedric&#39;s assets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained, &#34;No need to liquidate anything.I want control over all of Phillips Group&#39;s assets and Cedric&#39;s management for the next ten years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you want Cedric to sell himself to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep her identity hidden, Daniela had nonchalantly cited a price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resumed her game just as Cedric stepped outside to take a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan later sent a message with an&#34;okay&#34; emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric came back, Daniela suddenly asked,&#34;Cedric, we&#39;re still married, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, puzzled by her question, answered, &#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt slightly irritated. &#34;Well, your assets are our shared assets. Before you decide to dispose of them, you should inform me. Do you undorstand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated, then asked, &#34;What?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nearly admitted he had just rendered himself bankrupt and committed to the next ten years of his management career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued playing her game, head bowed,while Cedric sat beside her, pondering how long it would take him to rebuild his fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly realized it would take ten years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a seat next to Daniela and leaned in,whispering, &#34;Darling, how about keeping a strong,handsome man who can cook and keep you entertained? Aside from my legs, everything else is pretty great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her face emotionless. &#34;Cedric, enough with the charm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric found himself at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, the villa was encircled by strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose called Cedric. &#34;Cealmaur has confirmed their leader is here. I&#39;ve been searching, but can&#39;t spot them anywhere. Boss, I&#39;m dying to see this legendary mercenary leader. If you catch sight of them, let me know. It&#39;s no surprise they lead Cealmaur; they&#39;re invisible.&#34; Cedric felt uneasy. &#34;Can one person manage this? It seems risky. Make sure they prioritize my wife&#39;s safety -it&#39;s crucial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul reassured him, saying, &#34;Boss, relax. They&#39;ve accepted our contract; they&#39;ll handle it. You both should rest easy tonight. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for the Cealmaur leader. I&#39;ve always wanted to meet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Oiscoll, Nikolas said into his phone, &#34;I&#39;m arriving in Olisvine tomorrow. I better not see Cedric at the airport!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the person on the other end could respond,Nikolas ended the calI abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do they always refuse to listen? What&#39;s up with the attitude of the wealthy these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone asked,&#34;Boss, should we make a move now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding? Want to get killed? Didn&#39;t you notice Cedric is with Clarinda? If we barge in now,we&#39;ll be shot. Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,what&#39;s the plan? Nikolas arrives tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be patient and watch. Lone Wolf is expected to pull back tonight. Once Daniela eases up, we&#39;ll...&#34; &#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Shadow? What&#39;s she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And hold on! Isn&#39;t that Ryan and Lillian? Weren&#39;t they reported dead? How are they here now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subordinate next to him asked,′′SO, are we still going to kill Cedric?&#34;</p>
