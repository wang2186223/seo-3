                <p>While Alexander was basking in the attention as people eagerly handed him their business cards,Cedric quietly slipped into a seat in the very last row,keeping a low profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, ever observant, caught sight of him and waved,signaling for him to come forward to the front row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing there were no open seats available,she quickly arranged a place for him among the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle gesture sparked envy among the men in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith leaned towards Alexander and quipped,&#34;See?That&#39;s what having the right connections gets you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s smug demeanor instantly darkened at those words, and he snapped sharply, &#34;It&#39;s just a way to show off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith chuckled and teased, &#34;Feeling any regrets about divorcing Daniela now? Cedric looks like someone you should keep an eye on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scoffed dismnissively. &#34;That guy?&#34; Cedric and Daniela had known each other for ages.If there was ever anything between them, it would&#39;ve happened by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But beneath his confident words, a flicker of unease crept in. Alexander couldn&#39;t shake the worry that Daniela might find out Cedric was the boy from her past. He knew this secret needed to stay buried-no one could ever find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Alexander&#39;s unease, Keith smirked. &#34;Relax,I won&#39;t spil anything. But you owe me one. When you seal the deal, throw me a bone,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith&#39;s family specialized in hardware and interior design, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;Fine. Once I secure the project,the interior design is all yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith&#39;s face lit up with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned closer, his voice sharp. &#34;And remember-keep that secret buried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith nodded with a satisfied smile, feeling confident and victorious. He was certain that he could return home with promising news to share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the bidding meeting began right on time. While everyone had anticipated Daniela&#39;s presence,only the Elite Lux bidding team showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They proceeded with an overview of the project and outlined the bidding schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room sat in focused silence, scribbling down notes diligently, even those who believed they stood no chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them, Cedric wNas also seen jotting down notes with unwavering concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In stark contrast, Alexander and Keith remained seated upright, showing no interest in taking notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, puzzled by their indifference, turned to Alexander. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you taking notes? Look,everyone else is all over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the two projects valued in the tens of billions and involving intricate details and cost breakdowns,it was no wonder everyone else was frantically scribbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why bother? I&#39;ll just get the confidential budget report from Daniela later,&#34; Alexander remarked,prompting a wave of envy among the note-taking executives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their note-taking became increasingly half-hearted. If everything had already been decided, what was the point of their meticulous notes? It felt like they were just going through the motions, jotting down meaningless numbers. This project was clearly intended for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Keith, oblivious to the underlying tension but thoroughly impressed, was in high spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting dragged on for over three hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time it finally ended, everyone had filled their small notebooks with notes-but no one made a move to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Alexander claiming access to a confidential budget report, the attendees lingered,hoping for even the tiniest peek to salvage some value from their time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was fully aware of what they were sticking around for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up, he casually brushed the lint off his suit pants and made his way towards Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could get too close, Lillian gestured for him to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t help but feel a sudden rush of happiness. Daniela&#39;s stubbornness was obvious. Deep down, she still cared about him, no matter how much she tried to hide it. Clearly, this was her way of luring him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a composed smile, Alexander strode forward confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric,&#34; Lillian said as she handed him a thick notebook. &#34;Daniela gave it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All heads turned, and everyone strained to get a better look. And there it was, the Confidential Budget Report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela mentioned that you&#39;re tied up with the North District project, so there&#39;s no need for you to participate in the bidding. By the time you wrap up,this project will have reached its mid-phase, and you can step in with your team to evaluate the earlier work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement hit like a thunderclap, leaving everyone speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone quickly raised a hand. &#34;Wait, does this mean the bid only covers the first phase of the project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded affirmatively. &#34;Exactly. The second half wasn&#39;t part of the bidding because it&#39;s already assigned. We prefer working with trusted partners.If it weren&#39;t for the fact that Cedric&#39;s tied up with the North District project, we would&#39;ve let him handle the  entire new project too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s statement confirmed the executives suspicions, though few had anticipated the collaboration between Daniela and Cedric would extend beyond the North District project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a reminder of the undeniable strength of connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s mood soured instantly. What on earth was this supposed to mean? Was he expected to work under Cedric&#39;s supervision if he won the project?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the same people who had been buttering him up moments ago now gravitate towards Cedric filled Alexander with indignation, yet he refrained from storming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his posture, he walked over to Lillian with a steely expression. &#34;Can I have a copy of that confidential budget report?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave him a bemused look before chuckling. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, and you are?&#34;</p>
