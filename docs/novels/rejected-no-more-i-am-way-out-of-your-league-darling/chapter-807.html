                <p>That day, an unexpected face turned up among the job applicants at Daniela&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a good fit for this position.&#34; The HR department-handpicked by Cedric-never wavered in guarding his interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed with hostility: &#34;And what exactly makes me unfit? Are you saying I failed to meet your standards, or are you just brushing me off because you don&#39;t like my face? If you&#39;re rejecting me,at least have the decency to explain why!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter Bauer, the HR manager, scoffed, &#34;I make the calls here. If I say you&#39;re not a fit, then that&#39;s the end of it. No debate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t flinch. When dealing with people he thought beneath him, he never backed down. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you always this unreasonable? Are you the one in charge here? Can you actually speak for Daniela? I&#39;ve run a company before. Now I&#39;m applying for a basic sales role.What&#39;s the issue with that? Your job listing says anyone who fits the requirements is welcome to apply. Was that just for show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter shot him a seething glare. &#34;It&#39;s not for show.You just don&#39;t belong here-period!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander folded his arms, posture smug. &#34;I get it.You&#39;re one of Cedric&#39;s people, aren&#39;t you? Look, 1don&#39;t care if you&#39;re trying to shield him, but don&#39;t forget-this is Daniela&#39;s company, not Cedric&#39;s!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter&#39;s face flushed with fury, his eyes bloodshot from the pressure building behind them. His lips parted,but no retort came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could manage was another hostile glare. &#34;I said you&#39;re not a fit. That&#39;s final.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s employees had always been fiercely loyal to him,guarding his interests with unshakable devotion. Alexander stood his ground. &#34;You&#39;ve got two options -either go tell Daniela I&#39;m here, or I&#39;ll call in a reporter and let the world see how her staff is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>already flexing power they haven&#39;t earned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter turned red, struggling for breath, completely thrown off by the confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot a quick look at the brewing tension, then darted upstairs to alert Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela descended, she found Alexander standing tall, radiating smug satisfaction as he cornered Dexter, who looked like he&#39;d been driven to the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander jabbed a finger toward Dexter&#39;s forehead.&#34;This is Oiscoll, not Olisvine-and definitely not Phillips Group. You don&#39;t call the shots here anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; Daniela descended the stairs with a frosty gaze. &#34;So what,you own the place now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had been busy putting Cedric&#39;s people in their place, but Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the tension like ice water. He faltered, caught off guard by her sudden appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned with an easy grin. &#34;Daniela, I was just helping you manage your staff. Didn&#39;t expect you to show up so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela flicked her gaze toward Dexter, silently instructing him to move behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Alexander, her tone sharp and clipped. &#34;And who gave you the authority to manage my staff? Perhaps I&#39;ve been too lenient with you before. At the end of the day, this is my company.Dexter is my HR manager, and you&#39;re standing in our recruitment hall. He calls the shots here. Any objections?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed like a slap-denying him even a shred of courtesy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander knew Daniela would side with Cedric, but he didn&#39;t expect her to stand up for Cedric&#39;s people too. His stomach twisted, the bitterness rising all the way to his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a tense breath, he said tightly, &#34;Daniela, I was only trying to help. I heard you started a company, and I genuinely wanted to offer support.Your staff was being rude, so I figured I&#39;d step in and put him in his place for you. I wasn&#39;t trying to cause trouble. Don&#39;t get the wrong idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance his way. Her voice stayed frost-cold as she addressed Dexter instead. &#34;He&#39;s here to apply for a position, is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter gave a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head. &#34;So? What&#39;s your conclusion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Dexter replied, &#34;He&#39;s not a fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d braced for follow-up questions, but to his surprise, Daniela didn&#39;t press him. Instead, she turned to Alexander and said, &#34;You heard him, didn&#39;t you? My HR manager says you&#39;re not a fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to shoot him down so abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze for a second before asking,&#34;Why not?What&#39;s the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held his stare without flinching. &#34;Does there have to be one? This is my company, and Dexter&#39;s the HR manager. If he says you&#39;re not a fit, then that&#39;s the end of it. What more do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she said it-so dismissive, so final-left no room for argument. It was maddeningly unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had no comeback-her words had struck too cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood frozen, dumbstruck, while Dexter watched Daniela with wide eyes, visibly stunned by the force of her authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Alexander turned and stormed off, his chest tight with rage and indignation. Dexter stepped forward and apologized</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a sidelong glance. &#34;What are you apologizing for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice. &#34;Based purely on qualifications, Alexander does check all the boxes for a hire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knit together, confusion flickering across her face at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;But I&#39;m biased. I don&#39;t want to hire him.I think he&#39;s got another agenda-he&#39;s not here for the job. He&#39;s here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;So you turned Alexander down to defend Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter gave a small, sincere nod. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
