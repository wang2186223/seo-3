                <p>Daniela had just mentioned feeling a touch under the weather in her office when Linden walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, are you feeling a bit off-color?&#34; he inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, leaning her elbow on the desk, pressed her fingertips to her temples.&#34;|′V suddenly come over a bit dizzy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes lit up at her words. He exchanged a quick, knowing glance with Natalie, who stood nearby.&#34;It&#39;s likely nothing serious. Let me have a look. Perhaps you&#39;ve caught a bit of a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood nearby, arms crossed, radiating an icy disapproval with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden felt a surge of triumph. Usually, it was like navigating a minefield trying to get close to Daniela,but now, with.her feeling unwell, everyone would have to defer to him, the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, let&#39;s check your blood pressure,&#34; Linden offered, his gaze lingering on Daniela with a hint of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela possessed a more refined, almost regal air compared to Natalie. Though they shared a striking resemblance, the pride and aloofness that shimmered in Daniela&#39;s eyes were qualities Natalie could only dream of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, completely mesmerized by Daniela, seemed to have forgotten the presence of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Natalie asked, &#34;Howis Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, still lost in the labyrinth of Daniela&#39;s beauty, felt his heart do a little tap dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could be with Daniela, he&#39;d gladly pay any price, even his own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing aside, gritted her teeth. How could Linden be acting like a lovesick puppy at a time like this? Could he get dumber?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She marched over and gave Linden a hearty slap on the back, nearly sending him sprawling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, visibly annoyed, turned to meet Natalie&#39;s warning stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s just a minor thing, a slight cold. A little medicine will do the trick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden retrieved the prepared medicine from his kit and, with a flourish, presented it to Daniela with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina,&#34; Daniela called out. &#34;Please prepare this medicine for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina nodded, a flicker of worry crossing her face, suspecting Linden might have tampered with it. But since Daniela had spoken, she trusted her judgment and complied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After preparing the concoction, Nina handed the cup to Daniela and stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing nearby, watched Daniela intently as she raised the cup to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you two leaving?&#34; Daniela inquired, pausing mid-sip.there something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes darted towards the cup near Daniela&#39;s lips, a mix of excitement and nervousness swirling within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re on our way. Go ahead and finish your medicine, and then we can all breathe easy,&#34; Natalie replied,her smile a tad too bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned the smile. Then, right before Natalie&#39;s very eyes, she downed the medicine in one smooth gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s heart, which had been doing the cha-cha, finally relaxed at the sight of the empty cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A triumphant smile spread across her face, her whole demeanor radiating a sense of smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Linden exited the office, and as they left, she glanced back at Daniela, noticing that her complexion seemed to have taken a turn for the worse. Once Natalie and Linden were gone, the office door clicking shut behind them, Nina let out a long sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She putled the medicine Linden had given her from her pocket. &#34;Daniela,you had me scared stiff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint smile. &#34;What was there to be afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina replied, &#34;I was terrified of getting caught.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained, &#34;In this office, the person Natalie trusts implicitly is you. By having you prepare the medicine, Natalie was already convinced she&#39;d achieved her goal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie always underestimáted Nina. She was certain Nina wouldn&#39;t dare cross her. Having Nina prepare the medicine was the perfect touch, maximizing the illuson of credibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave Daniela a thumbs-up.&#34;aniela, you&#39;re absolutely brilliant. What&#39;s the-next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled and whispered her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gasped in admiration. &#34;You&#39;re incredible, Daniela! This way, I can finally have my sweet revenge.&#34;</p>
