                <p>Even though Natalie had made many attempts to harm Daniela, Lillian had been on high alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had never succeeded once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, could you please deliver this cup of coffeeto Daniela? I&#39;m feeling unwell.&#34; Holding her stomach,Nataliemade her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave Natalie a look and asked, &#34;Do youhonestly believe we&#39;re that close?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Natalie was about to reply, Nina interrupted her, &#34;Stop calling yourself my sister; it&#39;s disgusting. No true sister would send her own sibling to a man&#39;s bed or ruin her marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was frustrated by Nina&#39;s resistance. But she needed Nina&#39;s assistance. She needed Nina to deliver this coffee to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Daniela in the way, she could take over Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And without Nina, the Dury family&#39;s wealth could be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could accomplish two goals with a single action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, I admit I was wrong. Please, help your sister out and take this coffee to Daniela. I really don&#39;t feel well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stared at the coffee, hesitated for a moment, then offered a smile. &#34;Alright. But first, you owe me an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina requested, &#34;Just say, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, Nina. I made a mistake. I should not have teamed up with Elyse to trick you into believing that it was Cedric at the hotel that night when it was actually Linden. It was wrong of me to set up my sister like that. I acknowledge my fault.!&#34; Natalie scoffed, &#34;What do you mean? Areyou still upset about something that happened so long ago?Do you even belong to the Dury family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sarcastic smile, Nina answered, &#34;Do you still see me as part of the Dury family? You certainly didn&#39;t hesitate to set me up. Are you going to apologize or not? If not, I&#39;m leaving.&#34; With those words, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, stop! Okay, I&#39;ll say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gave a small smile and turned her back to Elyse, quietly pressing the record button on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian walked past from a distance, observing the scene, yet she remained silent as she walked into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corridor, Natalie mimicked Nina&#39;s earlier words with a dismissive and condescending tone. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Nina. I made a mistake. I should not have teamed up with Elyse to trick you into believing that it was Cedric at the hotel that night when it was actually Linden. It was wrong of me to set up my sister like that.I acknowledge my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s voice carried a sneering and arrogant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Nina with disrespect, a deep sense of superiority rising within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed Nina recording but remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What harm could a recording do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could Nina really accomplish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Daniela had control over her. Nina was destined to remain her tool forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Nina managed to get this cup of coffee to Daniela, the control of Elite Lux and Harper Group would be in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After capturing the confession on her phone, Nina carried the coffee into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was there, seated. Nina set the cup on the coffee table and passed some papers to Daniela. &#34;Cousin,these documents require your signature today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, seated next to the table, picked up the coffee cup. Nina, observing from a distance, was alarmed.&#34;Hey! Don&#39;t drink that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed the coffee into a nearby trash can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian turned to Nina, who quickly explained, &#34;Natalie asked me to take this to Daniela. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s poisoned. She planned to make Daniela ill, hoping Linden would step in somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was cunning. She preferred not to involve herself in such schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina felt uneasy, but upon turning her gaze back, she noticed Lillian seemed completely undisturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela was signing the documents, her lips curled into a subtle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was confused.&#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising her eyes, Daniela replied, &#34;Lillian was merely testing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nina exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then instructed Nina, &#34;Take the empty cup out and inform Natalie that I&#39;ve drunk the coffee you brought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remained confused. Yet, she nodded obediently, picked up the empty coffee cup, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood by the door, her face showing a mix of nervousness and anticipation. &#34;How did it go?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still feeling confused and a bit shocked, Nina replied, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s impatience grew. &#34;The coffee!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina answered, &#34;She drank it. Didn&#39;t you ask me to bring it to her? Or am I mistaken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s face broke into a gratified smile. &#34;Yes, yes! Nina, you finally did something right.&#34; With those words, Natalie rushed downstairs. Nina guessed she was heading to inform Linden to prepare to come up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was utterly merciless. She was manipulating everyone around her while keeping up appearances of innocence.</p>
