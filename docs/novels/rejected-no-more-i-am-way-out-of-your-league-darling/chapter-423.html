                <p>Daniela seemed completely unaware of the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept across her face as she turned to Caiden. &#34;You always say that you&#39;re my father and that I share your blood. The more I think about it,the more it makes sense. So, here&#39;s an idea. What if l drain every drop of blood from your body? That way,the blood coursing through me won&#39;t be so tainted.What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden instinctively leaned back, shocked by her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela in disbelief, thinking she must have lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, she had been a bright little girl, clinging to his leg and begging for his affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, standing before him, was something unrecognizable, a ghostly figure-cold, detached,and utterly different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Daniela was keenly aware of the storm of thoughts raging in Caiden&#39;s mind, she remained indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, &#34;Have you figured out how to answer my question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden bit his lower lip hard, trying to control his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed, her smile as charming as ever. The moon peeked through the clouds, lighting up her already glowing face, and giving her a fairy-like appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her actions were swift and unhesitating.With a subtle movement, she pressed, and Caiden&#39;s agonized scream echoed through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said casually, &#34;It seems like the knife went right through your thigh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; Nina, unable to bear the sight any longer and overcome by the metallic scent of blood,bolted from the villa without warning, vomiting uncontrollably in the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene was beyond horrific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent over and vomited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unlike anything she&#39;d ever seen-a brutal,bloody revenge that seemed to stretch the limits of human cruelty. Fear clutched at her heart, but something darker, something inexplicably thriling,stirred deep within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping her mouth with firm resolve, Nina grasped the door handle and stepped back into the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had already passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela brought a bucket of water, and Caiden stirred as though he had narrowly escaped death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched him, smiling. &#34;Hi. We meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden considered pretending to be unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could, Daniela&#39;s laugh broke the silence. &#34;Don&#39;t bother. I&#39;ve got a box of adrenaline right here.Like | said, I won&#39;t let you die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she yanked the knife from Caiden&#39;s thigh and drove it back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over and over, she repeated the action, her face as serene and playful as a child with a new toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only interruption to her rhythm was Caiden&#39;s agonizing screams, each one more pitiful than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed unmoved, going through the motions until Caiden shouted weakly, &#34;Stopo it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Daniela asked with a hint of satisfaction in her voice, &#34;Ready to talk now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, Daniela straightened up. &#34;You know, if you&#39;d spoken up sooner, maybe all this pain could have been avoided. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left her lips, the knife sank into his already mangled thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His screams filled the air, but Daniela didn&#39;t flinch.She took a seat on the nearby sofa, her posture relaxed. &#34;Come on, then. Tell me. What were the conditions for this intermediary to spill my mother&#39;s secrets and whereabouts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took what felt like an eternity for Caiden to gather himself,his voice now barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the silence in the villa made every word painfully distinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first, they didn&#39;t contact me directly. Just sent me clues about your mother. Then, your mother reached out to me. I was ecstatic. But I was just a poor guy,clueless about how to win her over. When it came to dating, the clues from the intermediary suddenly stopped. I had no choice but to give it my all, even though I felt like a clumsy fool. After a few dates,your mother lost interest in me, and I could feel her pulling away. I panicked. I couldn&#39;t bear seeing her in circles | couldn&#39;t get into. Desperate, I tried everything to reach the intermediary. They never showed up. Just when I thought there was no hope left, they called me out of the blue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated and stole a wary glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peeled an orange, her face calm and almost blank, as if she were hearing a story from a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden let out a sigh of relief, pressed his lips together, and said honestly, &#34;The person on the phone told me if I followed their instructions, I could win your mother&#39;s favor and become her partner.The word &#39;partner&#39; was too tempting. It meant more than just a title-it promised power, status, and a life of wealth. I was swayed and agreed without really thinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet scent of oranges blended with the sharp tang of blood. Daniela popped a slice into her mouth.&#34;What did they tell you to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden replied, &#34;They want me to bring Katrina into your mother&#39;s villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Daniela stopped, her hand tightening around the orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dark eyes slowly lifted, a hidden threat lurking in her gaze as she asked, &#34;So, you and Katrina go way back. And the whole thing was a scheme from the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together with Elyse, the hypnotist who reached out to her, and that intermediary, they had carefully laid out a deadly plot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The victim was Brylee, Daniela&#39;s mother.</p>
