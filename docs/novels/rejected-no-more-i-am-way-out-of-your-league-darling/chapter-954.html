                <p>Even while at home, Daniela was already aware that Jules was pushing to split the remaining shares of McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked the finance team to figure out the value of those shares for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, she sat back and waited for a call from Brad and Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stood outside, looking tired and visibly humbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he stepped inside, he started to cry.&#34;Daniela! I&#39;ve come to say I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said, voice breaking. With a loud thud, he dropped to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad went on, &#34;I&#39;ll admit it. It was Josh who first came up with the plan that led to your mother&#39;s death.I didn&#39;t do much myself, but I agreed to it at the meeting, so I share the blame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared down at him. &#34;What about the explosion?&#34; she asked coldly. Brad shook his head. &#34;I truly had no part in that. When my father was alive, he always made it clear-no one was to hurt any of the family&#39;s descendants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad thought back to what Lara had told him.He knew he had to come clean with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I can say this-the explosion was definitely tied to someone in the McCoy family,&#34; he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad thought for a moment, then continued, &#34;A week before the explosion, it was my father&#39;s birthday.He&#39;d been gone a while, and I was worried he&#39;d had too much to drink, so I went looking for him. I found him in the garden, yelling in anger. His voice was shaking when he said, &#39;I told you not to mess with the McCoy descendants.What are you planning now? I&#39;m warning you-stop it at once!&#39; Later, someone came to call my father, and he went back to the hall. I peeked out but only saw a shadowy figure. There were too many guests that day, so I couldn&#39;t tell who it was. I thought my father had put a stop to it, but then the explosion happened out of nowhere. A few days later, he fell seriously ill and passed away. Before he died, he told us not to investigate. Much later, I remembered what happened that night and checked the security footage,but found nothing. What I did find the person who called my father. So I quietly arranged to meet with him to ask who was behind the explosion, but he  suddenly died that same day. I got scared and didn&#39;t dare look into it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Brad took out a USB and a guest list,placing them on the table. &#34;This has the footage from that day and a list of all the guests. I hope it helps.&#34;Brad looked more sincere than ever. He looked at Daniela and said, &#34;I know I played a part in what happened to your mother, and you&#39;ll want justice.I just ask that you spare my kids and my granddaughter -they had nothing to do with it. If you need help with mthe explosion case, just say the word. I&#39;ll do everything v f can.&#34;brBrad turned and walked out, wiping tears from his face. From the car parked at the entrance, Jules and Ethan quietly watched the scene unfold -Jules let out a low chuckle.&#34;Did you catch that,Ethan?Brad practically swallowed his pride in there. Could i you have done that? Tell me honestly-what are you Jueven going to say to Daniela now? It&#39;s too late.&#34; Ethan, clearly frustrated, snapped back, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t s have been late if you hadn&#39;t held me back!&#34; Jules sighed. &#34;There&#39;s no point dwelling on it now.5dJosh is waiting for us. He said we&#39;re family and he&#39;ll p take care of us. Trust me, you won&#39;t lose anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he gave a quick nod to the driver to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the driver,who worked under Ethan, looked over at him,waiting for his say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan hesitated for a moment, then finally gave a reluctant nod. As the car rolled farther away,he couldn&#39;t stop glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, something told him that the decision he made today would cost him more than he was ready for.</p>
