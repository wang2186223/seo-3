                <p>Hamilton initially planned to restrain himself, but ultimately failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules sounded like he care about Daniela.Nevertheless, it merely served as a justification to confirm whether Daniela was poisoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules articulated everything so sweetly, yet none of his brothers demonstrated as much devotion toward Daniela as Carol did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were brothers, but now it seemed that bond wasn&#39;t important at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their bond couldn&#39;t even compared to what Daniela and Carol shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contemplating that, Hamilton balled his hands ferociously and outright launched verbal attacks at Jules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you ashamed? You&#39;re already adults, but lack financial capability. You avoid addressing your responsibilities, but constantly hassle my daughter-in -law. I don&#39;t get why guilt never strikes you. Why don&#39;t you just die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules stared at him, stunned. &#34;Hamilton...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough nonsense!&#34; Hamilton roared.&#34;Listen carefully.I once endured all of you because I trusted familial solidarity. I merely assumed we belonged together.Before Father died, he told me to look after you guys.Now I realize you guys are quite capable and don&#39;t need my care at all. Starting today, we go our separate ways. You affairs have nothing to do with me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying that, Hamilton grabbed Jules&#39; bag and flung it onto the ground, trampling over it repeatedly before entering the house furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules remained immobilized. He questioned reality,uncertain if the person earlier truly was Hamilton.Wasn&#39;t Hamilton always the most forgiving among the family? Why couldn&#39;t he endure them any further?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stepped from the vehicle, his expression icy as he commented, &#34;Hamilton isn&#39;t the same guy as before. Have you realized that now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules scoffed, &#34;What a scoundrel! Just because he&#39;s got grandkids now, he forgets his siblings,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, craving chaos, replied, &#34;Daniela has snatched everything meant for you. Now that he&#39;s rich,Hamilton has naturally become smug, dismissing his struggling kin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules burned inside, his glare venomous as Hamilton&#39;s figure vanished into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Daniela remained unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh restlessly lingered until twilight. As Jules&#39; concern intensified, the front door of the house gradually creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela appeared at the door, clad in a flowing white dress,beaming warmly and waving at the two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, positioned in the vehicle, glanced at Jules,confused. &#34;Is she waving at us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules faltered. &#34;No way. She can&#39;t spot us from that distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On hearing it, Josh redirected his attention to Daniela.&#34;Maybe Hamilton entered and informed Daniela we&#39;re outside. That&#39;s why she is inviting us in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nudged the car open, tone quiet and ominous,whispering to Jules, &#34;Let&#39;s get inside. We&#39;ll confirm if Daniela is poisoned. If not, I&#39;ll poison her again. This evening, she and her unborn babies must perish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh and Jules exited the car and approached,forcing grins onto their expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Daniela&#39;s grin outshone theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait. You&#39;ll stop grinning soon,&#34; Josh muttered inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After all that cash you stole from me, you still beam like that. Today, you&#39;ll die,&#34; Jules, too, whispered under his breath</p>
