                <p>At the sound of that, both Katrina and Joyce spun around, their eyes narrowing at the person who spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them sensed they were being singled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes darted to Joyce, and her expression changed instantly, going from contempt to pure shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina yanked Joyce&#39;s arm and gestured to the group behind them. &#34;Let&#39;s use the side entrance.It&#39;s much wider and quieter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made sure to steer clear of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were out of sight, Katrina&#39;s patience snapped. She grabbed the hem of Joyce&#39;s skirt and tugged it harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! Ouch, what are you doing?&#34; Joyce winced, pulling back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice lowered to a fierce whisper, her words dripping with fury. &#34;What did you do last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce blinked in confusion. &#34;What? Nothing! I just went out to enjoy myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoy, huh?&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice shook with rage. &#34;Did you even bother to shower? Look at your legs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked down, and her expression stiffened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina fumed with anger, her mind racing back to the wild group from the car, the heavy drinking, and now this. A sharp headache started to throb as she realized the gravity of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the years of raising Joyce-wasted in an instant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have intervened last night. She should have seen this coming!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it? Did you even use protection?&#34; Katrina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to her mother, her eyes wide with panic, her mind going blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina removed her jacket and wrapped it around Joyce&#39;s waist, hiding the marks of last night&#39;s mistake. She leaned in, her voice dripping with fury as she whispered, &#34;I didn&#39;t raise you to fall for someone like that. Whatever happened last night? It didn&#39;t happen. Do you hear me? Not a word of it! If J ever catch you with someone like that again, I swear I&#39;ll make you regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, visibly shaken, nodded quickly. She was too terrified to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her daughter&#39;s fearful reaction, Katrina continued, &#34;This stays between us. No one can know.You were drunk, and so was everyone else. No one remembers anything, and you need to make sure it stays that way. If anyone asks, deny it. Got it? If anyone else hears about this, it&#39;s over. Your reputation will be shattered, and no decent family will want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, Joyce nodded once more, her fear evident in the way her body shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Katrina let out a deep sigh, standing upright and briefly calming herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got back into the elevator with the others,her face remained tight with tension, and she kept murmuring sharp, cautionary words to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, completely unaware of all this,was watching the elevator numbers climb with wide eyes. Excited,he grinned and said, &#34;What&#39;s with all the whispering?Hurry up and get us to the top! I can&#39;t wait to see the view. It must be amazing from up there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face practically radiated excitement, his pride evident in the way he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, however, couldn&#39;t muster a bit of enthusiasm, no matter how hard she tried. Her lips barely curled into a smile, and the expression that appeared on her face was stiff, almost forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the scene unfolded, her mood began to lift, if only slightly-and for good reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, the group gasped in awe, their voices filled with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Caiden, usually composed and restrained,couldn&#39;t help himself and let out a genuine &#34;Wow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The 18th floor was the best of the entire building. It was truly a sight to marvel at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was nothing short of spectacular, offering an uninterrupted 360-degree panorama of the sprawling city below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floor had already been completely remodeled,with every detail radiating luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antique vases decorated every corner, and a magnificent table, threaded with gold, took center stage in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunning water feature greeted them at the entrance, a clear symbol of wealth and success,filling the space with an aura of prosperity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the real showstopper? A world-famous painting proudly showcased at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t aplace where luxury was simply suggested-it was unmistakably present in every inch of the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I recognize this painting!&#34; Katrina cried, almost jumping with excitement. &#34;It was auctioned off for fifty million not long ago. Can you believe that? It&#39;s pure opulence! With this hanging here, making money will be a piece of cake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smiled brightly, a feeling of immense pride swelling in her chest. Finally, Daniela had done something that actually mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Caiden was soaking up the praise being showered on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the moment seemed to peak, the elevator doors chimed softly and then slid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped out, dressed in a sharp, tailored suit that radiated authority and sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and the building manager beside him appeared momentarily thrown off by the strange mix of people in front of him. The other group was just as surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, both groups just stood there, staring at each other in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hesitated before taking a small, nervous step forward, her hands twisting nervously in front of her.Katrina gave a subtle pull on her skirt, a silent nudge of encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a breath, Joyce forced a shy smile and spoke in a soft, almost teasing tone. &#34;Mr. Phillips, are you here to congratulate me on my new office? Thank you so much for being here. It really means a lot. The space is still a work in progress, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina couldn&#39;t have looked happier. With a proud smile, she added, &#34;Cedric, welcome! What a wonderful surprise to have you here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt his pride grow as he watched Cedric.Having him there, with all his influence and status,was like a badge of honor for Caiden, giving him a sense of validation and boosting his confidence tenfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Joyce&#39;s friends were gathered at the back, staring at Cedric in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Cedric?&#34; one of them whispered, her voice shaky with astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re talking about Cedric Phillips? The business mogul who&#39;s always in the news?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s so put together, totally unlike us. He has this presence so polished, so sophisticated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but isn&#39;t Cedric known for staying away from social events? Why would he come here, of all places? And on Joyce&#39;s office opening day, no less.What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it clear? Cedric must have a thing for Joyce! I mean, why else would he be here? Joyce is basically set for life now-landing someone like Cedric? She&#39;s hit the jackpot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Living the dream. But why would Cedric go for someone like Joyce? She doesn&#39;t really seem all that sharp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last remark wasn&#39;t as quiet as the rest-it was loud enough for everyone to catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went still. Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce turned in sync, their glares sharp and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, the building manager couldn&#39;t help but stifle a laugh.</p>
