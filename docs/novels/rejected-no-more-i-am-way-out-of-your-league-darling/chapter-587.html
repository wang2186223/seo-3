                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t be bothered with the noise flooding the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, even being the CEO of Phillips Group felt trivial to him. If Daniela was okay with it, he&#39;d gladly hand over the reins to a professional manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already made more than enough to let him and Daniela roam the world without a care for the rest of their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, money was nothing more than a figure on a screen. What was the point of hoarding more? He&#39;d much rather invest his time in making a few babies with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ride home, Daniela caught Cedric sneaking glances at her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling through the latest headlines, she finally looked up, confused.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned in, lowering his voice. &#34;Sweetheart, why aren&#39;t you pregnant yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, momentarily lost. &#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rephrased with a straight face. &#34;I&#39;ve been putting in the effort, but still no baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing what he meant, Daniela cleared her throat, changing the topic since they were not alone in the car.&#34;People are losing their minds over your scandal. You really don&#39;t care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrugged, completely unfazed. &#34;Not even a little.&#34; What others thought didn&#39;t matter. The only opinion he cared about was Daniela&#39;s, and he knew she believed in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front seat, Lillian cast a glance at Cedric through the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear-Cedric genuinely couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no clue who was pretending to be him, nor did he bother worrying about it. Instead, he leaned back,shut his eyes, and let himself relax-somethingthat, oddly enough, made Daniela feel at peace too. A soft smile tugged at her lips as she realized how pointless her earlier concerns had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always worried about dragging Cedric down, and that fear had kept her from saying yes to his proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But watching him now, so at ease and unbothered, Daniela felt her own tension melt away. She leaned back,shut her eyes, and before she knew it, sleep took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Phillips Group&#39;s entrance, the PR team stood in a tense huddle, their nerves on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up, but to the PR team&#39;s growing frustration, no one inside made a move to step out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager stole a few glances, brows furrowing in impatience, before finally striding over, hand raised to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the front window slid down at an agonizingly slow pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d suggest leaving them be for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager caught on immediately, suddenly feeling like he had stumbled upon something he wasn&#39;t supposed to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts ran wild. Cedric and Daniela sure had their priorities straight. Even with a crisis on their hands,they were busy enjoying themselves in the car. And they didn&#39;t even care if someone heard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, the PR manager whispered, &#34;Lillian, doesn&#39;t this feel awkward for you? Want to step out and wait with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian waved him off. &#34;No need. They won&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people sure were unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t care about being overheard, and Lillian was completely unfazed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan caught the PR mnanager&#39;s increasingly awkward expression and decided to step in. &#34;Quit overthinking.They are just asleep in the back.&#34; Lillian laughed. &#34;Besides, waking up your boss too soon is a bad idea. Give it another half hour if you don&#39;t want trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stirred, she opened her eyes to find everyone playing online games, patiently waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly hit her-she should probably book a doctor&#39;s appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she had been unusually drowsy, her back ached constantly, and the mere scent of meat made her stomach turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gazedrifted to her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the verge of smiling when a soft knock tapped against the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, she heard a light tsk. Turning, she saw Cedric watching her. &#34;Still sleepy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head, smiling as she rolled down the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager stood outside, practically sweating bullets.&#34;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s urgent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod and stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked alongside him, his tone casual. &#34;It&#39;s nothing major. Don&#39;t blow it out of proportion and stress out my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager&#39;s jaw nearly dropped. &#34;The internet is throwing a frenzy over you, and you call that nothing serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couple was downright unbelievable. They treated the company&#39;s crisis like a minor inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, the PR manager laid out the situation, only for Daniela to nod, unfazed. With that, he let out a relieved sigh and took his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough, their laid-back attitude rubbed off on him, making the issue seem far less urgent than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the last time disaster struck, Daniela had handled it effortlessly. Compared to that, a flight attendant was hardly a concern. Meanwhile, at the commerce association, Alexander leaned back in the president&#39;s chair, hiseyes narrowing. &#34;Are you seriously suggesting jumping off the Elite Lux building? Absolutely not.&#34;</p>
