                <p>Lithan&#39;s shout echoed through the space, drawing Alexander&#39;s attention as he stepped in from the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes scanned the roomn, realizing that Daniela was no longer present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disappointment washed over him, and he briefly thought about leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet before he could make his exit, he walked over to Lillian and asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His motive was simple: to gain Lillian&#39;s favor, knowing she was connected to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his surprise, as soon as he spoke, Lillian turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him standing there,feeling awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce stood off to the side, observing the entire exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s fist tightened in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina spoke with a knowing tone.&#34;Alexander&#39;s pride knows no bounds. If it weren&#39;t for Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t even spare Lillian a glance. Joyce, take my advice-secure half of the Bennett family&#39;s assets first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t respond; instead, she walked straight towards Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, who are you looking for?&#34; she asked, observing how he&#39;d been searching for someone ever since he stepped in from the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one,&#34; he replied, his voice losing its edge as he saw Joyce, his disinterest clear. &#34;I&#39;m leaving now,&#34; he added before turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was left standing there, now the subject of whispered mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the idle circles of the elite, gossip flourished, and that night, Joyce was the main topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to think Alexander was really into Joyce. He still married her after she gave birth to another man&#39;s child. Turns out, there was more to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. It seoms Alexander&#39;s heart is sti with Daniela. He likely used his connection to Joyce as a way to get closer to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Makes sense. After áll, Joyce just can&#39;t measure up to Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder Alexander never comes home to sleep. The only time they had sex was because Joyce set him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce&#39;s methods are truly underhanded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, fury contorted Joyce&#39;s face as she knocked all the drinks off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anger boiling over, she stormed towards the gossips and slapped one of them three times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stil not satisfied, she grabbed the girl by the hair and slammed her head hard against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent in shock as thecrowd stared, unable to comprehend what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when blood began pouring from the victim&#39;s forehead did the security rush in to hold Joyce back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her hands held tight, Joyce erupted in a frenzy of harsh words, her fury spilling over as though she had completely lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The victim lay motionless on the floor, unconscious and drenched in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room watched in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at Joyce, as if she were insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stood on the sidelines, taking in the entire spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but gasp in shock, desperately wishing he could slip away unnoticed from the unfolding chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was beyond humiliating. Just as he was about to step away, Kátrína&#39;s voice cut through the air. &#34;Richard,you can&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran down hls spine as he realized everyone&#39;s gaze had shifted to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to leáve, but with Joyce being his daughter-in-law, he couldn&#39;t simply walk away from the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, Richard stepped forward to manage the situation, cursing his bad luck for being caught up with such a crazy and vicious woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The injured girl was rushed to the hospital, and Richard quickly paid a hefty sum of five hundred thousand as an advance for the medical bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, he accompanied Joyce and Katrina to the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the following morning, the entire elite social scene was abuzz with the scandal: Alexander had married someone so unrefined, a simple country girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, seething with anger, yelled into the phone at Alexander, who was on his way to the police station.&#34;You need to divorce her now! This is the last straw!&#34;</p>
