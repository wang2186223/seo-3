                <p>Prior to the press conference,Daniela made her way to Cedric&#39;s attending physician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex Myers, a highly respected expert in his field,had known Daniela for years. As soon as she entered,she got straight to the point and asked, &#34;How long until Cedric wakes up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex&#39;s face clouded with concern. &#34;I can&#39;t give you a specific timeline. I&#39;ve run all the tests, and while the car accident was severe, it wasn&#39;t catastrophic enough to leave him in a coma for this long. I&#39;m still trying to figure out a few oddities in his medical data.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed with sharp focus. &#34;How long are we talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It could take a month, maybe longer. I have a hunch that what he ate might be connected, so I&#39;ll focus my investigation there,&#34; Lex replied,his voice tinged with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in Daniela&#39;s gaze deepened. &#34;Are you implying that something Cedric ate caused this coma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex nodded solemnly. &#34;It&#39;s possible. I&#39;ve found  irregularities in his blood work, but nothing is definitive yet. I need more time to dig deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela absorbed his words in silence, a sharp clarity settling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s recovery wouldn&#39;t be quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady nod, she turned to leave, her voice unwavering. &#34;You have access to all of Elite Lux&#39;s medical resources. The labs are open to you.I won&#39;t wait a month. Ten days, Lex. I need answers within that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped out of the doctor&#39;s office,Lillian was already waiting for her. &#34;All the reporters from Olisvine are here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief nod was Daniela&#39;s response. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of joining Lillian for the press conference,Daniela took a different path, heading to Cedric&#39;s ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered herself into a chair by his bedside,her gaze lingering on him-motionless in his hospital gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, the stillness of the scene made it seem as though Cedric was simply deep in sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you never understood why I kept our relationship a secret. You argued with me time and again,but I held firm. You always wanted to know why.  Now I can finally explain. I did it because I feared this.I feared that one day, you would end up like this.My life is a tangled web of burdens, some of which go back to my mother&#39;s death. I always thought that as long as I kept our marriage hidden, I could shield you from the dangers that come with it. No matter how much it upset you, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to cross that line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela realized hiding her marriage with Cedric was pointless. Those cruel people would never spare anyone close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, today, everything changes. I&#39;m making our relationship public. From now on, Cedric, I&#39;ll protect you, and I&#39;ll protect Harper Group, Elite Lux, and Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, the press conference is about to begin.&#34;Lillian knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly placed Cedric&#39;s hand back beneath the blanket, her voice gentle as she whispered, &#34;Rest,Cedric.I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela got up and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she crossed the threshold, the smile she had been wearing vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The press conference buzzed with an air of chaos. Reporters, eager for answers, wvere consumed with curiosity over the sudden accident and eager to see how the young female CEO would navigate Phillips Group through this storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of them were quick to judge, questioning if Daniela, not being the CEO of Phillips Group, was overstepping her role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tough questions were on the horizon. The reporters had clearly come prepared, ready to press Daniela on every angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the conference began, Daniela took her place at the center of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A microphone, waiting like a silent sentinel, stood before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped into the room, an unmistakable shift in her presence rippled through the crowd-she was sharper, more focused than her usual self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon, everyone,&#34; Daniela said, skipping the pleasantries. &#34;Thank you for being here. By now,you&#39;re all aware of the car accident that involved Cedric and myself. This wasn&#39;t an accident. It was a deliberate attack on our lives, and the authorities are already involved. I won&#39;t get into the specifics right now. Today&#39;s conference is about the future of Phillips Group and ensuring full transparency for both the public and our investors.&#34;</p>
