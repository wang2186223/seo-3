                <p>A flash of recognition crossed Hamilton&#39;s face when he spotted Daniela&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping to conclusions, he decided Daniela had tossed Nikolas and Damon aside to save her own skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of surviving among the McCoy famnily had shown him nothing but backstabbing and ruthless ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Daniela wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a second to cast Nikolas and Damon aside if it meant saving herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, he thought, she even orchestrated this,leaving them behind to make the McCoy family turn on each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea alone sent his temper soaring. He stormed toward the vehicle, every step brimming with anger. Deep furrows lined his face, twisting into a mask of pure fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tight fists shaking, Hamilton shouted at the closed car door, &#34;Daniela! You&#39;re nothing but a schemér-hiding behind my sons like they&#39;re shields! Get out of here! I won&#39;t spare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words fell, the door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only someone like you would leap to that conclusion,&#34; the driver scoffed, his voice dripping with contempt. &#34;Ms. Harper doesn&#39;t stoop to your level. Not even close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver turned to Nikolas and Damon, not bothering to mask his indifference. &#34;Step out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon exited the car, shame etched into every line of their faces. The vehicle pulled away immediately after. The driver had no intention of lingering or seeking help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton could barely process what he was seeing.He finally asked, &#34;So Daniela sent you back? Where&#39;s Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric isn&#39;t coming,&#34; Nikolas answered with a chill in his voice. &#34;He would rather die than leave Daniela&#39;s side. Neither of them would ever betray the people they care about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer curled Hamilton&#39;s lip. &#34;And you really think any of that is true? They sent you away because you refused to stay put. And don&#39;t forget-the only reason you&#39;re treated this well is the McCoy name and what it stands for. Don&#39;t ever forget what this family&#39;s done for you. The McCoy family made you who you are. Don&#39;t start thinking you&#39;re anything without us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Insults poured out as Hamilton lectured, never missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your story?&#34; Nikolas shot back. &#34;You think Daniela fears your power, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hard edge returned to Hamilton&#39;s glare. &#34;Isn&#39;t that obvious?&#34; A humorless laugh escaped Nikolas. &#34;You&#39;ve got it all wrong.Damon and I offered to stay behind-we wanted to protect them. Daniela worried that we would get killed. That&#39;s why she insisted we leave.Both of us argued to stay, but they refused. Can&#39;t you see? They didn&#39;t want us as shields. Uncle Josh didn&#39;t give a damn about our lives, while Daniela actually did everything to keep us safe. So ask yourself, Dad-who&#39;s the real family? You&#39;ve spent so many years locked in your narrow world,you can&#39;t even believe that someone might care about us without caring about our name or status. Daniela doesn&#39;t care about the McCoy family. She just wanted us to live. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going back. If I have to die, then so be it-l&#39;d rather be with them than hide behind your pride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passion burned in Nikolas&#39; voice, wild and raw-a side of him that rarely surfaced. For once, he felt like his own person, not some shadow of the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A furious bellow burst from Hamilton. &#34;You dare?After barely escaping, you&#39;d march right back into the middle of chaos? The place is a warzone, and Daniela may already be gone! What do you hope to accomplish? Don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re the ones who raised you. Daniela gave you some petty cash for that company, but the McCoy family are your true family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile flickered on Nikolas&#39; face. &#34;Sure, you raised us. But it always felt like charity-like we were supposed to grovel for scraps of self-respect.We&#39;re not just burdens waiting for handouts, Dad. We&#39;re human beings. We deserve better than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolute, Nikolas turned on his heel and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s rage boiled over, his face turning the color of brick. &#34;You come back here! Take another step and I&#39;ll break your legs myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Nikolas called back, &#34;Then I&#39;ll crawl if I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton teetered on the edge of losing his composure. He swung around to face Damon,who had stood quietly off to the side, and jabbed a finger toward Nikolas as he walked away. &#34;Look at that. Nikolas has completely lost his senses because of Daniela. People ought to remember what it means to be grateful. Without me, you&#39;d still be aimless boys with nothing to your names. Every decision l&#39;ve made, every plan l&#39;ve put in place, has always been for your sake. Do not end up like Nikolas-so incorrigibly stupid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving the butler over, Hamilton yelled, &#34;Let Nikolas ruin himself if he wants. We&#39;re going inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode toward the villa, expecting the others to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after several paces, he glanced back to find he was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning,he stared in disbelief at Damon, who hadn&#39;t moved an inch. &#34;Well? Why are you just standing there? Come inside.&#34;</p>
