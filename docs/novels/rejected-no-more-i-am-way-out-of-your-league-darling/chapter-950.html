                <p>The McCoy brothers didn&#39;t bother to hide their sour mood. They thought Daniela had come to stir up trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t need to ask what they were thinking.One look at their faces told her everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without slowing down, Daniela stepped into McCoy Group and said, &#34;Come in. It&#39;s too hot out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela walked straight into the largest office space used by the staff. After settling into the main seat,she asked her secretary to turn on the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the McCoy family began to trickle in, the secretary moved to close the windows, but Daniela stopped him. &#34;Leave them open. What I need to say should be heard by the employees too. If anyone wants to stay and listen,let them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly and spotted the record keeper,who was adjusting her glasses in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave her a small smile and said, &#34;Please take notes. And post the meeting summary on the intranet afterward.&#34; The woman gave her a grin. &#34;Got it, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she called Daniela &#34;boss&#34; seemed to jolt everyone awake. It suddenly made sense why Daniela always seemed to know what happened in their meetings. The spy they had never been able to identify had been right under their noses the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then pulled the empty chair beside her, and the record keeper took the seat without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared at Daniela with fire in his eyes. &#34;Daniela,this isn&#39;t your company. What makes you think you have the right to act like you run this place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules jumped in quickly. &#34;Exactly! So you&#39;re pregnant -what of it? We don&#39;t even know the baby&#39;s gender.Why are you already acting like you&#39;re in charge here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan didn&#39;t hold back either. &#34;Daniela,you&#39;ve really let pride go to your head. Do you even realize where you&#39;re sitting? That seat belongs to the leader of McCoy Group. Are you the leader? Then why are you sitting there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned his frustration on Hamilton. &#34;Say something already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton adjusted his collar and gave a slight nod.&#34;I&#39;ve already said this before. My health isn&#39;t what it used to be. I&#39;ve been meaning to step down for a while. You didn&#39;t believe me then. You kept dragging me back into this, so I had no choice but to bring Cedric in. Why is that so hard to accept?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished, the room fell into shocked silence. Every face stared back at him, their expressions tight with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad spoke first. &#34;Absolutely not. I won&#39;t accept this.Cedric helping out is fine. Daniela isn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules gave a firm nod. &#34;Yes!&#34; He didn&#39;t fully agree with Cedric&#39;s presence either. To him, there was no difference between Cedric and Daniela showing up.They were so closely tied that any secrets one knew,the other likely knew as well. Still, there weren&#39;t any other options. McCoy Group had no one left to run it.Josh had already taken off with a huge portion of their assets. If they failed to keep control of what little remained, they&#39;d end up as a public joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan caught the looks exchanged between his brothers and understood. He couldn&#39;t go against them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he wanted most was to see McCoy Group stabilize, just enough so he could cash out and leave.Living each day in fear wasn&#39;t something he could keep doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had come to settle old scores. Ethan figured it was better if she directed that rage toward someone  else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he got his share, he&#39;d disappear to a place she couldn&#39;t reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no illusions about her strength. Crossing her would only lead to disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched his brothers, already able to guess what was going through their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not on board, then choose your own leader for McCoy Group. I&#39;m out,&#34; Hamilton said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Hamilton really wanted was to secure Cedric&#39;s future in McCoy Group, giving his branch something to hold on to,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with everyone else pushing back, his plans were quickly unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of arguing, he decided to let each family pick someone to represent them in future company matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Daniela reached into her bag and took out a file, tossing it across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone flinched as if expecting something explosive.Several of them leaned back. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;someone blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her chin and gestured at the document &#34;This is today&#39;s financial summary. If you keep quiet and cooperate, you&#39;ll still hold your positions as shareholders for now. But the moment you try to get in my way, I&#39;ll have you removed. The report makes everything clear. McCoy Group is losing money fast.Expenses are running higher than income. If I decide to push things with outside financing, this whole company could end up in my hands overnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her eyes on the McCoy brothers, watching confusion bloom across their faces. Then she shifted her attention to the marketing manager, who had been standing by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager caught her gaze and gave her a strained smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a short nod. &#34;They don&#39;t believe me.Make it clear to them. Spell it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager, sensing the pressure in the room, quickly responded, &#34;Ms. Harper means that McCoy Group is already hanging by a thread. If she chooses,she can take full control. She&#39;s warning you not to provoke her. If you do, she&#39;ll take over, and none of you will be left with anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad blinked at him, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules turned to the manager and asked, &#34;Is it really that bad?&#34; Ethan&#39;s voice shook. &#34;No, that can&#39;t be right. McCoy Group&#39;s strong. There&#39;s no way it could collapse that easily.&#34;</p>
