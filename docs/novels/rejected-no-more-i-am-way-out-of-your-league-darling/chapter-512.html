                <p>The next day, as soon as Daniela stepped into her office,she immediately noticed something was off-the flowers Cedric had bought for her were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she called Lillian inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;Huh? But they were still here when we left last night. Let me check with the cleaning lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried off to investigate, but when she asked around, the administration department delivered unexpected news-the cleaning lady had abruptly resigned, even refusing her half-month&#39;s salary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian quickly checked the surveillance footage and discovered the woman sneaking out of Daniela&#39;s office,clutching a large garbage sack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would she want with the flowers?&#34; Lillian asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat motionless in her chair, the warmth in her expression replaced by an icy chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not the flowers she&#39;s after, but the person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian was about to ask what she meant, Cedric suddenly pushed the door open, carrying a fresh bunch of flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the flowers from yesterday?&#34; He glanced around, looking for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile. &#34;The cleaning lady knocked them over this morning and took them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded in understanding.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got to work arranging the new branch. Lillian leaned in and murmured under her breath, &#34;Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a firm nod.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone remained steady as she instructed, &#34;Keep a close watch on Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the words left her lips, a knock sounded at the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked noticeably older than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry had etched deep lines into his face, and with Alexander stilI missing, the weight of his troubles had only grown heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family had crumbled into bankruptcy, leaving Richard with just one last hope-Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I hate to trouble you, but have you heard anything about Alexander?&#34; His voice carried a desperate edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied him for a moment, her gaze settling on the gray streaks now threading through his hair.Then, in an even tone, she said, &#34;Someone&#39;s seen him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes lit up instantly. &#34;Please... if you find anything,let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod of acknowledgment. Grateful, Richard bowed several times before making his way to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back for one last look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had grown even more like Brylee-her face bright, her presence effortlessly radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she were still his daughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were the case, Bennett Group wouldn&#39;t have collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wouldn&#39;t have vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of those terrible mistakes would have ever happened. If only life had a reset button...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that heavy truth weighing on him, Richard walked away in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a strong hand yanked Richard around a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through him, and he nearly let out a scream-until he caught sight of the person gripping his arm. His eyes narrowed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric?&#34;.Confusion flickered across Richard&#39;s face. &#34;What the hell are you doing? And why are you dressed like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was nothing like before. On TV, he always dressed in a dignified suit, with a cold face that warned strangers to stay away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man standing before him was dressed in black, with a hoodie pulled over his head and a baseball cap on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was deeply hidden under the brim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they weren&#39;t standing so close, Richard wouldn&#39;t have even known it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this money. Use it however you want.&#34; &#34;Cedric&#34; shoved a check for a million dollars into Richard&#39;s hand, his voice low and firm. &#34;And forget you ever saw me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard froze, staring at the check in stunned silence. &#34;Why are you giving me money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#34; turned to leave, but Richard grabbed his wrist. &#34;If you don&#39;t explain, I&#39;m not taking a cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard tried to shove the money into his hands. In the struggle, he caught sight of the birthmark behind the other man&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander?&#34; Richard&#39;s breath hitched as his eyes widened in sheer shock. He gripped the man&#39;s arm even harder,his voice cracking with raw disbelief.&#34;Alexander, is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of his name, Alexander&#39;s steps faltered. Richard&#39;s entire body shook, his breath coming in shallow gasps. His fingers twitched at his sides, barely able to grasp the reality before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really you? What happened to you? Have you been suffering all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated, then slowly reached up and pulled off his cap. The dim light revealed his face--identical to Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, trust me. I&#39;ll turn everything around. I made mistakes with Daniela before, but once I have wealth beyond measure, I&#39;ll repay her a thousand times over. For now,take this. It won&#39;t be long before | corne home for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes burned red. He nodded repeatedly, his grip tightening around the check. &#34;Alrighnt.I will wait for you.You and Daniela will come home together, and we&#39;ll finally live like a family again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pulled his cap back on and slipped into the shadows, vanishing without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned, Joyce was still seated, absentmindedly toying with the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just ignore the flowers, Joyce. Isn&#39;t Cedric the one you really want?&#34; I&#39;ve thought of a way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t bite immediately. She merely twirled a petal between her fingers, watching it as if deep in thought. There was no rush. Daniela had three days to consider the partnership. A deal that profitable-she wouldn&#39;t refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once it was set in motion, she would have all the time in the world to be by Cedric&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love cultivated under the right circumstances would last. That was her belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that there was no marriage to bind her, she had every opportunity to make him hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander studied her coldly, seeing right through her schemes. &#34;Men are easily enamored before marriage.Even after marriage, some still stray. But if a child is involved, that changes everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back against the sofa, his gaze sharp. &#34;People have been saying Daniela and Cedric were planning for a baby. Who knows? Maybe she&#39;s already carrying his child.&#34; Joyce&#39;s fingers stiffened against the petals. Then, her eyes turned cold, filled with malice. &#34;What was the plan you just mentioned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rested her chin on her palm, her gaze lingering on Cedric as he arranged the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone on the desk vibrated violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for it without much thought, answering casually.</p>
