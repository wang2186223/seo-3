                <p>Daniela knew well the stubborn pride that men carried especially someone as defiant as Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet even with his injury, he kept showing up, time and time again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard had once mentioned that after Cedric injured his leg, he barely left his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here he was, ignoring the pain, dragging that injured leg just to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had a striking, effortless charm. Alexander might have altered his face to resemble him, but to Daniela, the two couldn&#39;t have been more different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander carried a sharp, calculating air-built for business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,on the other hand, was refreshingly unguarded.There was an openness in the way he looked at her,so sincere it stirred an unexpected ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, she wondered-how did someone this unguarded survive in a world as ruthless as business?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back?&#34; Cedric lifted his gaze at the sound of the door, a soft smile touching his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Daniela answered. &#34;Have you been waiting long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;I made your favorite sushi. Put it together myself.Want to give it a try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze, an automatic refusal at the tip of her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t particularly hungry, just drained, but something about the quiet hope in Cedric&#39;s eyes made her change her mind.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had spent the day at a follow-up appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always handled these appointments alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew that the explosion had left her body damaged-that having children might never be an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of her wanted to tell Cedric, but what was the point? He didn&#39;t need that weight on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her past was gone, wiped clean, and she was moving forward.Cedric would, too, in time-once he learned to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt no guilt for thinking this way. They were both naturally quiet, so the meal passed in wordless understanding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last bite was gone, Cedric rose, cleaning up with an effortless ease-thoughtful as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you liked it...&#34; Cedric hesitated, a tentative smile softening his sharp features. &#34;I can bring you something else next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft gloom settled over the office, and outside,a gentle rain began to fall, each drop whispering against the windowpane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush filled the space, thick and unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back in her chair, her silence stretching across the dimly lit room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after Cedric had finished tidying up that she finally broke the silence. &#34;Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand stilled at the sound of her voice. Slowly,he lifted his head, his eyes seeking hers through the half -lit room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; His voice was gentle,laced with quiet sincerity,as if bracing for what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear-he already knew what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers curled against the armrest before  loosening again, as if warring with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t really matter what I eat,&#34; she said evenly.&#34;| told you before-I have a lot on my plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered being more direct, cutting deeper with her words but then,she hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among adults, words were often unnecessary.The understanding lay in what wasn&#39;t said, in the quiet retreat that followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, Cedric understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers instinctively tightened around the food container, and in the vast emptiness of the room, he forced a weak smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile so fragile, it looked like the slightest push would break it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; he murmured, lifting the container. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to overstep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight nod,he turned and walked out, leaving the room as quietly as he had entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain never grew heavier that night, only whispering its sorrow against the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood by the towering wvindow, staring at the world below. Cedric limped down the street, his thin suit billowing slightly in the wind, his silhouette caught between resilience and quiet misery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache bloomed in Daniela&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the feeling could settle, Carol burst into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, we know who was behind the explosion!&#34;</p>
