                <p>From the instant they entered the car,Daniela stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silencemade Cedric feel somewhat uncomfortable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the wound that Daniela had recently tended to,Cedric responded to Carol, &#34;Yes, I learned a little before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was astonished. &#34;Just a little? If I hadn&#39;t known you, I would have assumed you&#39;d been training for years.With so many people just now, I thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stole a quick glance at Daniela and quickly added,&#34;I thought it was over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never expected you&#39;d handle so many people.I was shocked. I need to tell Ryan and Lillian-they&#39;ll be just as amazed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol lowered her head to message Ryan and Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car lapsed into silence again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stole a glance at Daniela, an unusual dryness in his throat. He took a sip of water, then another. The car pulled up in front of the villa Daniela had bought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wvalked straight inside without looking back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric followed her inside, his head lowered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol happily snapped photos from behind, texting Ryan and Lillian &#34;Cedric follows Daniela like a devoted partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric entered the villa, Daniela was already in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knocked on the door, which opened by itself,and he stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was standing on the balcony. She turned when she saw him enter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought over a first-aid kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down,&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric silently sat down. After the bandaging was finished, he saw Daniela&#39;s expression soften slightly Then he said, &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone remained firm. &#34;I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grinned. &#34;You care about me, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela truly cared for him. Cedric had grown up on his own, and now he finally returned home He deserved better than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among those guards,some had been intent on ending his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, but Daniela could clearly see the deep gash on his arm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even had the audacity to invite them for a meal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Hamilton only invited her from the start, she might have let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton had specifically insisted that both of them attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing more than a test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was satisfied, they would be manipulated by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wasn&#39;t, they would have been left to die there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really the behavior of a father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Daniela noticed that Cedric wasn&#39;t too shaken by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned grim. &#34;Cedric, I need you to answer me honestly Please be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Are you absolutely sure you don&#39;t want to inherit the McCoy fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head &#34;I don&#39;t want to I have family -my grandmother and you. I also have money. It&#39;s not a fortune, but it&#39;s enough to live comfortably I don&#39;t want much. Just a simple, ordinary life. Whoever wants the McCoy fortune can have it. It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was silent for a moment, as if gathering her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t bear to see Daniela frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;As for Hamilton or the McCoy family, I have no attachment to them. They&#39;ve never shown me any goodwill, so they mean nothing to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was very clear about his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the future,he would build his own family. Whatever the McCoy family thought or did would no longer concern him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family was Daniela, and that was all that mattered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever Daniela went, that was home for him. Daniela felt a wave of relief wash over her upon hearing Cedric&#39;s words</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright! Then I&#39;ll show Hamilton who&#39;s really in charge here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled and nodded&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that Daniela tolerated the McCoy family&#39;s behavior out of consideration for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was not necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care about any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela understood now, and from that moment on,she wouldn&#39;t hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Hamilton, feeling smug,fantasized about gaining Cedric&#39;s affection by pretending to care,hoping it would make Cedric acknowledge him as his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were always drawn to wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With money in hand, any misdeed could be easily forgiven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a casual motion, he pointed to a bottle of herbal tonic in the storage room and arrogantly ordered his secretary, &#34;Take that to Cedric tomorrow. TeIl him it&#39;s a special selection from me. And invite him and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela to dinner at the vila tomorrow night This time,it&#39;s for real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary quickly asked, &#34;The last two times you invited them for dinner, it didn&#39;t happen. Do you think they&#39;ll come this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, confident as ever, replied, &#34;Of course!Everyone likes money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held the McCoy family&#39;s wealth in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hamilton was basking in his own satisfaction,the marketing department called to inform him, &#34;Mr.McCoy, the vacant building across from the McCoy Group headquarters has been sold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, &#34;So what? Why all the fuss?&#34;</p>
