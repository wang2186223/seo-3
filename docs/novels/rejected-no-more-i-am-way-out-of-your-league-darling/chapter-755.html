                <p>That day, a reporter made a blunt comment. &#34;There have always been rumors about McCoy Group being built on fairness and integrity. But seeing Nikolas today, it looks like he can&#39;t even stand the thought of losing. He won&#39;t let anyone else win, either. And it isn&#39;t just anyone he competed with. It&#39;s his sister-in-law.As a woman,Daniela should have been treated with some basic decency. But Nikolas didn&#39;t even manage that. This doesn&#39;t match the image he spent years building. Honestly, it raises a lot of questions. Maybe all this time, Nikolas was just hiding his true nature-cold, volatile, and willing to do anything to keep his hands on the McCoy fortune. And here&#39;s the real concern. McCoy Group isn&#39;t just some company. It drives Oiscoll&#39;s economy. If Nikolas takes the reins, are we looking at financial disaster for the whole country?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as those words hit the news, Nikolas felt like the ground had been ripped out from under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, trembling, his eyes full of panic as he turned to Hamilton. &#34;Father, it&#39;s all Daniela&#39;s fault. She set me up. She made me lose control. You have to stand up for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t even look at him. He sat there, watching Daniela on the racetrack. Her smile was bright, her spirit shining even from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Nikolas had lost everything. Not just his pride. The public had stopped seeing him as the rightful heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. He had to admit-Daniela was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas saw the disappointment cloud Hamilton&#39;s face. Desperately, he turned to Joseph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph pressed his lips together, then spoke quietly. &#34;Daniela is clever. Very clever. But someone like her isn&#39;t easy to control. She can&#39;t be leashed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stayed silent, turning the heavy ring on his finger. No one could read his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph knew when to shut up and stepped away without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood stiffly to the side, his eyes burning with hatred as he watched Daniela smile at the crowd. After Daniela walked off the field, the mood of the crowd shifted from mockery to a quiet kind of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone there had seen it happen with their own eyes. Daniela, the woman they once looked down on, had tamed a wild horse right in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had no choice but to see her differently now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers noticed the change in the air immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they frowned. Their cold glances darted toward Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, none of them knew she had already been granted free access to McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stayed clueless until Nikolas fired off a message in the family group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,faces turned pale and hands moved fast, sending replies back and forth in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; message read, &#34;Just watch. First she gets into McCoy Group, then she&#39;ll worm her way into management. She says she&#39;s investigating the explosion, but what she&#39;s really doing is helping Cedric fight for the inheritance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen shot back an angry emoji. &#34;So what do we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon jumped in fast. &#34;The McCoy fortune belongs to us. I don&#39;t accept Cedric as one of us. Nikolas,you&#39;re our eldest brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran piled on right after. &#34;That&#39;s right! You&#39;re the only one we acknowledge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, feeling buoyed by their support, tapped out another reply. &#34;The real issue is that Father is already fond of Daniela, which means he&#39;s getting fond of Cedric too. If this keeps up, sooner or later, everything we worked for will end up in Cedric&#39;s hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph saw Damon&#39;s message, sighed to himself, and whispered, &#34;Today is a family gathering. Let&#39;s not cause any more trouble today. If you have other plans, wait for another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had already been humiliated enough. One more mistake and Hamilton would explode. But Nikolas refused to listen. He clenched his teeth so hard his jaw popped. &#34;Daniela made me lose face in front of everyone today. I&#39;ll make her pay for it-double!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph could only sigh deeper than before. Under his breath, he muttered, &#34;Just don&#39;t get tricked again.That would be too shameful to bear.&#34;</p>
