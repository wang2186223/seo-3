                <p>Each McCoy shot the other a look, seeing the same reluctance reflected back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had already confronted Daniela but didn&#39;t get what he wanted. None of them dared push her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned to leave when Jules let out a low laugh.&#34;Daniela, we don&#39;t mean to meddle, but the baby you&#39;re carrying might be the first boy in our family.He means a lot to our traditions. This is serious, and we&#39;re deeply concerned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flicked her eyes over the McCoys, surprise flashing in them. With so many kids under their name, was this one child really that big a deal? She hadn&#39;t seen that coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules caught her puzzled look and added with a soft grin, &#34;Here&#39;s the thing. When our father died, he left word.Whoever brings him a great-grandson into this world first gets to run McCoy Group. So, naturally, we care about the baby&#39;s gender. We do care about you too,of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never given that old tale much thought She did remember skimming a file about their father&#39;s wishes, but it never seemed worth her time.She never had any appetite for the McCoy fortune anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she couldn&#39;t hide her shock. &#34;All these years, not one boy?&#34; Her voice carried pure disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence draped itself over the McCoys. And like a spark to dry grass, her next question came quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your family tree has five branches. Hamilton has five sons: The rest have a flock of children. Some are already married off.&#34; She recalled staring at their massive family chart once, amazed by how crowded it looked. &#34;How can they all be girls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked it without a hint of mockery, just honest wonder. Still, the McCoys bristled, feeling a slap in that innocent question.Daniela had hit where it hurt most. They all tasted that burn. A single careless.truth could cut deeper than a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a light laugh.&#34;So the real trouble sits right in your own family. You&#39;re all worked up thinking my baby&#39;s a boy who&#39;ll swipe McCoy Group from under you, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad never thought Jules would spill their father&#39;s will to Daniela. Wasn&#39;t that like handing their secrets to someone who might use it against them? Could Jules be any more clueless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not quite it. What I mean is-McCoy Group isn&#39;t something you want, right?&#34; Jules locked eyes with Daniela, silently begging her to say she didn&#39;t care &#39;about the family&#39;s riches, just like she rejected their name. Jules even had a lawyer on standby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I know wealth means nothing to you.Money&#39;s the last thing on your mind. Look. If you truly don&#39;t want a cent, I brought a lawyer today. You can sign this paper and officially give up any right to the McCoy fortune. Once it&#39;s sealed, I promise life here in Oiscoll will be smooth for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jules stopped talking, he watched her like·a hawk, almost itching to drag her over to sign that waiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed the document now sitting before her and let out a quiet laugh. &#34;You&#39;re chasing the wrong problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoys went stiff, staring at her in blank confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her chin and said, &#34;You keep pointing fingers at me, scared this baby will mess up your share. But the real trouble? It&#39;s hidden somewhere else. You just haven&#39;t seen it yet. Got it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped out, the McCoys still looked dazed and baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules muttered, &#34;What did Daniela mean? Where&#39;s this so-called big problem she claims we&#39;ve missed?Is she saying McCoy Group is in trouble right now and we&#39;re blind to it because we&#39;re too busy fussing over her? But what trouble could there be? Hamilton isn&#39;t even running the show. Josh is. He&#39;s our eldest brother. He&#39;d never betray us. So what game is Daniela playing at?&#34;</p>
