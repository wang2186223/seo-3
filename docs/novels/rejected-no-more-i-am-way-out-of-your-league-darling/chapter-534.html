                <p>Daniela was playing an online game with Cedric when Lillian entered the room. &#34;Daniela, the commerce association has invited you to join them for a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela straightened up, her lips curling into a slight smile. &#34;They couldn&#39;t resist any longer, could they?thought they would hold out a bit more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sneered, &#34;Those old foxes are cunning. They never dirty their own hands; they prefer to have others do the heavy lifting while they enjoy the fruits of their labor. It&#39;s sickening!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed and said, &#34;Show them no mercy. Let them see our strength. Tonight, we handle those merchants, and by tomorrow, those veterans will be the ones on the offensive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lingered at the doorway, observing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held great admiration for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never encountered anyone as bold and unapologetic as Daniela, who fearlessly embraced both love and hate. Daniela&#39;s radiance was undeniably compelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, who was usually timid and reserved, felt empowered by Daniela&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She aspired to always stay close to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian reappeared and said, &#34;Daniela, does this mean you won&#39;t be attending the dinner tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was disinterested. She found large gatherings and dining out overly noisy and bothersome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother&#39;s old friend is indebted to Hackett. He hopes that you join them for a meal for his sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. &#34;They&#39;ve even got in my mother&#39;s friend. Skip dinner. I&#39;ll just meet them for coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian responded to the invitation right outside Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other party was exceedingly grateful and quickly sent over the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Lillian chuckled. &#34;They&#39;ve arranged to meet at the Alejandran Coffee, where a single cup costs a hundred thousand. These old guys are really splurging this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela waved dismissively. &#34;Tell them to meet me at the cafe downstairs instead.&#34; Lillian nodded and then glanced at Cedric, who was still in the room. &#34;Is he going too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric flashed a grin. &#34;Am I included?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, your name&#39;s on the list. Will you be attending?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, clearly seeing through the group&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained determined. After their recent setbacks, these old folds were likely hoping to gain an advantage by negotiating with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;ll attend. If I don&#39;t, it will just terrify them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina overheard this and thought Cedric and Daniela made a perfect team. She was deeply impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to her with a smile. &#34;One day, I&#39;ll find someone suitable for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina returned a smile, although her interest in marriage had waned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting was scheduled for eight o&#39;clock that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had just wrapped up a multinational conference when Lillian entered. &#34;Daniela, they&#39;ve arrived. All eight of them are here, but they&#39;re trying to keep it under wraps to avoid any media attention that could embarrass them if it leaks that they&#39;re here to negotiate. They&#39;re dressed very plainly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded and made her way downstairs with Lillian and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially,these people were worried, but their anxiety eased upon seeing Daniela. Their posture improved visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why? Daniela was so pretty, they immediately assumed that she got what she had today by relying on men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slight build didn&#39;t suggest a powerful CEO but rather resembled a television star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They believed she was outwardly dazzling, though internally, she might be feeling the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group exchanged looks, a mutual understanding passing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They suspected Cedric had orchestrated this business move,not Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given her delicate demeanor, she appeared more as eye candy than a force in business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela drew closer, their anxiety diminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been standing, but before Daniela even reached them, they had taken their seats. Noticing this, Daniela&#39;s smile widened. She turned to Cedric and whispered, &#34;It seems they think I&#39;m the easy target.&#34;</p>
