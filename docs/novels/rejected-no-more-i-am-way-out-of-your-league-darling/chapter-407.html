                <p>Daniela was the kind of person who could execute such ruthless plans without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Linden had succeeded in raping Nina, the aftermath would have been inevitable-Nina&#39;s descent into madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation could turn even the weakest soul into a weapon, sharp and deadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could have waited patiently for the chaos to unfold, stepping in later as the untouchable savior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even given Nina an opportunity to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s mind swirled with unanswered questions, but she couldn&#39;t voice them all. Daniela&#39;s expression remained impassive as she said quietly, &#34;Because it&#39;s too dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina blinked, her brow furrowing in confusion.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Using Cedric&#39;s name for something like that-it&#39;s revolting. I despise it, and l won&#39;t let it happen. Besides, I want anyone who genuinely loves Cedric to never have that love tainted. So no, I didn&#39;t save you for your sake. I did it for Cedric. Does that make sense to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina froze, the weight of Daniela&#39;s words sinking in.&#34;That&#39;s it? Just for that reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela inclined her head slightly. &#34;That&#39;s all there is to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden wave of emotion overcame Nina. Tears pooled in her eyes, spilling down her cheeks-not out of heartbreak, but from an overwhelming sense of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because, at last, she had found someone who held love in its purest, untainted form-just as she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had thought offering herself up for Cedric&#39;s sake was already a monumental sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s ability to cast aside her disdain, all in the name of true love, felt even more extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Nina had faltered halfway through her plan,while Daniela had gone through with saving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Daniela&#39;s gaze with newfound determination, Nina spoke with quiet resolve.&#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve proven your strength. Whatever your plans are, I&#39;m on your side now. I&#39;ll be the weapon you need to destroy every threat the Dury family poses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Nina told Daniela the reason why Cedric was in a coma was because of the pastries and how to treat him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Cedric finally stirred back to consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, after being hypnotized, Linden had spent the night aggressively wrestling with a pillow in the hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning came, he awoke feeling utterly spent,as though he&#39;d run a marathon in his sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the empty room, a smug grin spread across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He truly believed Natalie had been there wth him the entire night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made him puff out his chest with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he hadn&#39;t bothered with any precautions. Maybe Natalie was already carrying their child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled shamelessly at the thought, his ego inflating as he got dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden headed back to the hospital, his mind set on fulfilling his promise to finish Cedric off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he approached the hospital&#39;s entrance, he froze, his gaze catching sight of several medical staff rolling their suitcases away. Confused, he quickened his steps and called out,&#34;What&#39;s going on? Why are you all leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One nurse paused, glancing over her shoulder. &#34;Ms.Harper ordered a complete replacement of the staff this morning. All of us have been dismissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Linden&#39;s confidence faltered.Panic rippled through him, tightening his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even begun to make his move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he left now, there was no guarantee Natalie would ever speak to him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even more pressing was the sudden image of Daniela&#39;s striking face flashing through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t gotten anywhere near close to her yet.How could he possibly leave now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, but Linden, you&#39;re in luck,&#34; someone said casually. &#34;Ms. Harper wants you to stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow furrowed as he stared at them in surprise.&#34;Wait,what? Really?&#34; &#34;It&#39;s true. Word is she specifically asked for you.Apparently, she&#39;s got a private medical center with some of the best perks around. If you make it in,don&#39;t forget about us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s heart nearly leaped out of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind raced back to when he&#39;d offered to be Daniela&#39;s private doctor the day before. Did this mean she had agreed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea was intoxicating, and he couldn&#39;t hold back the surge of excitement flooding through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything in his life seemed to be aligning perfectly lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt invincible, as if there wasn&#39;t a single obstacle he couldn&#39;t overcome-not when it came to winning over women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached the hospital entrance, a voice called his name from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, his grin broadened at the sight of Natalie approaching. &#34;Natalie! What a surprise! What are you doing here?|thought you&#39;d be taking it easy today and getting some well-deserved rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s expression twisted with revulsion as she took in Linden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently thanked the heavens that it had been Nina who endured the night with him. If it had been her, she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d be able to live with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How utterly revolting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Natalie kept her tone steady, refusing to let him see her irritation. &#34;They&#39;re replacing the hospital staff.What&#39;s your plan now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s grin widened, exuding misplaced confidence. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ve got enough talent to hold on to my position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed slightly in surprise at his arrogance. But she had no interest in prolonging the conversation. &#34;Fine. Just make sure you handle it today. Don&#39;t let anything go wrong.&#34; Linden nodded, his eyes shamelessly trailing over her. Without warning, he leaned closer, his hand reaching towards her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie immediately recoiled, her eyes flashing with warning as she stepped back. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking Natalie was just being shy, Linden chuckled.&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t handle a little affection from your boyfriend? We were wild last night, weren&#39;t we? After all, we&#39;ve already made love. What&#39;s the harm in a hug? Still feeling shy?&#34;</p>
