                <p>The crowd froze, then inhaled sharply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compensation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was Joyce after?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money,of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce and Daniela weren&#39;t real sisters. Their bond never reached the heart. It was all about the gains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to Joyce. Their faces were sharp with judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her head, and the veins on her forehead stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That awful feeling came rushing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she just felt humiliated again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela always seemed to ruin her plans like it took no effort at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had tried to set her up. But in the end, she and Jack were the ones who got burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack heard the whispers floating through the crowd. His cheeks turned red, and he lashed out, spitting at the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single move made people turn on him. Any sympathy he&#39;d earned by kneeling for hours disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s that boy so disrespectful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously.What kind of values did Joyce teach him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A kid like that shouldn&#39;t get a cent from Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s completely ungrateful. Daniela could pour her heart into him, and he still wouldn&#39;t stand by her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re clearly just here to grab some money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s the case, Daniela might as well adopt someone else. Better to raise a child who doesn&#39;t already have a mother whispering greed into his ear.That kid wants a shortcut to wealth without lifting a finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One voice burst out louder than the rest, yelling at Daniela, &#34;We&#39;re with you. Pick a new heir. Adopt someone who&#39;ll actually care. That child would treat you better than Jack ever could!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked nothing like she did three years back. She stood in the middle of the crowd, slim and pale,like the wind could knock her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People&#39;s eyes softened when they looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze to Joyce, who was fuming,then dropped her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this all for show?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew how to play that game too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I figured.&#34; Daniela tilted her face downward, her voice shaking just enough.&#34;But they keep dragging me back into it. You all saw what just happened. Jack didn&#39;t even recognize me, yet Joyce went around telling people he slept with my photo beside him every night. I&#39;ve never even met Jack.Most of you know I&#39;ve been sick. I can&#39;t have kids. And when I was at my lowest, the people closest to me didn&#39;t show up. They were too busy trying to split what little I had left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes glistened. &#34;Even something as small as helping children becomes a problem. They call it a waste. But it&#39;s not. Not to me.&#34; She stepped over to the principal. &#34;Sorry for the scene earlier.Please don&#39;t worry. Even if Jack and the rest shut me out, I won&#39;t stop. I&#39;ll keep helping the kids in need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled as she finished, her eyes faintly red. The camera didn&#39;t miss a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, the crowd buzzed with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters jumped on it like they&#39;d been waiting all day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People online couldn&#39;t stop talking about what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all eyes on her, Daniela gave a deep bow.&#34;Thanks, everyone. Let&#39;s wrap this up. Don&#39;t be too harsh on Joyce and Jack. They&#39;re just looking out for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears shimmered in her eyes as she walked away.She looked completely drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watching her felt a pang of guilt. In their eyes,she had shown nothing but grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time night rolled in, her story had taken over the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux stocks shot through the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her years of quietly helping kids get an education came to líght.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People couldn&#39;t stop praising her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, they tore into Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her office, Daniela sat on the couch, eyes flicking to the climbing stock charts. A faint smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped in and found her lounging with her phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, caught off guard by his red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d seen the news. He had raced over, thinking she&#39;d be curled up in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, there was a table stacked with fresh fruit,sushi, and desserts laid out neatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d just won a round and was grinning like a kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other end of the game, Lillian yelled,&#34;Daniela, move already! Hurry up! Ryan, you better cover me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking her eyes off the screen, she motioned to the seat nearby. &#34;Have a seat. I&#39;ll finish this match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric did as she said, quiet as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience came naturally to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her closely. For someone the world assumed was falling apart, she looked anything but sad. The game ended. Ryan and Lillian begged for another round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grabbed his phone and joined them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan groaned. &#34;Cedric? Seriously? Don&#39;t slow us down with your ancient skills!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Daniela, then said under his breath,&#34;I&#39;ll do what I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, they were back in the game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for Daniela to notice. Cedric moved in sync with her like he could read her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He covered her at every turn, making the whole match smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the round ended, Ryan and Lillian had had enough. &#34;We&#39;re out. You&#39;re not even playing for real.You&#39;re just flirting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then their avatars disappeared from the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set down her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes still carried a hint of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought back to how he looked when he first arrived, and let out a soft laugh. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re kind of a softie.&#34;</p>
