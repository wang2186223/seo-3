                <p>&#34;I want you,&#34; Cedric said without a moment&#39;s hesitation. His voice was resolute. Observing Daniela&#39;s confusion, he added, &#34;Yes, you understood correctly. I wish to leverage that promise you made as a means to start a relationship with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was stunned. The pen she held trembled lightly. Speechless, she realized her pulse was now surging. &#34;A relationship? What sort of relationship do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marriage,&#34; Cedric answered bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his declaration, Daniela felt a knot form in her chest. &#34;You must have heard my conversation with Caiden just now. There&#39;s no need for your sympathy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, foreseeing her potential refusal, retorted,&#34;It&#39;s not sympathy I feel for you, Daniela, but genuine affection. I want to marry you. I want to offer you the love, attention, and protection you were deprived of in your youth. In the future, on any rainy day, no matter the distance, I&#39;ll be there to cover you. You won&#39;t have to face anything alone again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The proposal came so suddenly that Daniela struggled to gather her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed on, knowing well that given time to think, Daniela might decline due to her practical nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might think this low of me, but I&#39;m laying all my cards on the table. Hearing your words to Caiden hurt me deeply. I&#39;m invoking the promise you made to propose marriage. I&#39;ve said my piece; now I need your decision. Does your promise still stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, you&#39;re not being rational right now.&#34;Daniela&#39;s vision blurred as she set aside the paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the contrary, I&#39;ve been too rational until now!&#34;Cedric exclaimed, straightening his posture. &#34;I&#39;ve always been overly cautious, ensuring | assessed every situation before acting, and I&#39;ve let you face challenges on your own. But no more. I don&#39;t just want to maintain a distance; I need to be your husband,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s demeanor was commanding. His resolve mirrored the tenacity he applied in his business endeavors. He fixed his gaze on Daniela,determination clear in his eyes. &#34;I can&#39;t continue as merely an admirer. This distance is intolerable. Today,I must secure my place by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly withdrew her hand from the table. She was overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment.She had indeed made a promise, and she felt compelled to provide Cedric with a clear explanation,despite her reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a moment to collect her thoughts,ensuring clarity in her response. &#34;Cedric, over the years, I&#39;ve changed significantly,&#34; she began. The overhead light cast a shadow, cloaking her in a mysterious, almost spectral glow. Her words were measured and thoughtful. &#34;I&#39;m not the child you once knew. Even my teachers have remarked on my extensive changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;ve only grown more remarkable.&#34; Cedric purposely twisted her words to mean something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed her lips for a while before adding,&#34;My personality has changed as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied with a simple, &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;I&#39;ve been married once, briefly. It taught me that I struggle with commitments deeper than friendship. I&#39;m not particularly vibrant or engaging. In fact, I tend to be quite introverted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said, &#34;When we first met, you were struggling with your health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised her eyes to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You once said I was your cure for depression. So,would you trust me once more?&#34; Cedric asked, his voice filled with tenderness. &#34;Do you believe I can be there for you through the years?&#34; His statement seemed to carry the weight of a vow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had a way of taking from Daniela what she cherished most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a compassionate soul stood before her, yet she harbored a deep-seated anxiety as if he were merely an illusion that might vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her life, though successful, felt isolating at its heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The circle of people she trusted was small, and her fear of losing someone if she allowed them closer weighed heavily on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve never met my mother,&#34; Daniela continued,biting her lip lightly. &#34;Many remark that I resemble her closely. You&#39;re familiar with Caiden; deep down,he&#39;s intimidated by her. He views her tactics as too forceful, her influence too expansive, and her wealth overwhelming,factors that diminish his self-worth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found herself at the peak of global wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, she occupied the top tier of the world&#39;s financial hierarchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she amalgamate her holdings, she might well claim the title of the world&#39;s wealthiest person indefinitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you worry I might end up like Caiden, intimidated by your success?&#34; There was a brief silence as Cedric studied Daniela&#39;s face, seeking to reassure her. &#34;Do you fear I might distance myself, feel overshadowed by your wealth, or be daunted by your business insight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze softened, full of compassion, as he continued, &#34;What other reservations might you have about me as your husband? Share them with me; I&#39;m here to listen and to address any issue you might raise.&#34;</p>
