                <p>As Cedric gently rinsed the fruit for Daniela, a message from Mose blinked onto his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, you&#39;ve still got it. I thought Ghost would be a challenge for you, but you took care of it like it was nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly typed back. &#34;Was anyone nearby when that happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a strawberry nestled in his hand, he sent the message and casually placed his phone down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone&#39;s screen stayed illuminated, still waiting for a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message pinged fromn Mose. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I led Shadow away. No one saw a thing. But I still don&#39;t understand. Why does Shadow guard you? And for all these years?&#34; Cedric didn&#39;t have an answer himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, Mose messaged again. &#34;Boss,Ryan from Cealmaur says their leader wants to meet with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hesitated, then replied, &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose&#39;s response came quickly. &#34;No clue. They said they want to thank the leader of Lone Wolf. Boss,what did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was utterly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose inquired, &#34;Boss, are you going to meet them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Cedric was about to reach for his phone, a figure appeared beside him, eyes glued to his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s looking to meet you?&#34; Nikolas asked, his voice curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quick reflexes, Cedric slipped the phone into his pocket. &#34;My phone&#39;s contents are private. Didn&#39;t you know that?&#34; With that, he turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas squinted, his gaze following Cedric&#39;s retreatingfigure, his mind racing with questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to have seen &#34;Lone Wolf&#34; on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there a link between Cedric and Lone Wolf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they share some kind of history?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurried to catch up with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was texting Mose. &#34;Forget it. I&#39;m not meeting them. It&#39;s just too much hassle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose responded, &#34;Alright. Anyway, you&#39;re only focused on your wife&#39;s safety. But I don&#39;t get it.You&#39;re so capable yourself. Why spend all your wealth just to keep her safe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded, &#34;What do you know? If I acted and she saw, she would be scared. She&#39;s timid, unlike you -tough and hardened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose couldn&#39;t hold back. &#34;Do you realize how much you&#39;ve spent just to avoid scaring your wife? Hundreds of billions! And ten years of your time. And you don&#39;t even care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric genuinely couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a master at making money, but to him, wealth was the least of his concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he couldn&#39;t bear the thought of Daniela being afraid of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere idea of Daniela discovering his past and distancing herself from him sliced through his heart like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose couldn&#39;t help but tease, &#34;A hopeless romantic!That&#39;s genuinely terrifying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot back, &#34;You don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose replied, &#34;Alright, if you&#39;re certain you don&#39;t want to meet with them, I&#39;ll inform them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to respond when Nikolas suddenly leaned in from behind. &#34;Who&#39;s this person you&#39;re meeting?&#34; In an instant, Cedric powered off his phone and, with a fluid motion, sent Nikolas tumbling over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; Nikolas lay sprawled on the floor, clutching his side. &#34;Have you lost your mind, Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was just as surprised. It was a knee-jerk reaction. &#34;Why do you always sneak up behind me?Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, equally confused and frustrated, shot back,&#34;How was I supposed to know you&#39;d react so fast?Help me up! My back&#39;s killing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary rushed to assist him. Meanwhile,Nikolas&#39; mind raced with thoughts. &#34;My back&#39;s just as hurt as Cedric&#39;s leg. Maybe Daniela will feel sorry for me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Nikolas&#39; eyes, Cedric being the apple of Daniela&#39;s eye felt like Cedric had claimed every ounce of luck the McCoy family could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela had a soft spot for him too, he&#39;d be the leader of the McCoy family, without a doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, both of them shared striking good looks.Whatever Cedric had, Nikolas could have it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he was hurt far worse than Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela could feel sympathy for Cedric, why couldn&#39;t she feel the same for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, wincing with pain as he clutched his waist,pushed open the door to Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m hurt,&#34; he called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, deep in the middle of a video conference,frowned when the goofball barged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re hurt, see a doctor. Why come to me?&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused, surprised by her response. It was exactly what he had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My back&#39;s worse than Cedric&#39;s leg,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela immediately grasped what he meant and frowned, giving him a look that suggested he&#39;d lost his mind. &#34;Nikolas, you may look pitiful now, but you&#39;ve forgotten something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at her, blank-faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained, &#34;Cedric&#39;s leg injury happened while saving me, so I feel sympathy for him. Your injury, however, has nothing to do with me, does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas suggested, &#34;Why not just stab me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, silent, waved her hand, signaling for the secretary to throw him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went back to her meeting as Nikolas was escorted to the hospital. Cedric stood by the office door, a small bowl of strawberries in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt someone at the door and looked up, only to meet Cedric&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Daniela asked.′′Are you coming in or going out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained in the shadows, the light stretching his silhouette across the floor. &#34;Do you treat me kindly just because you feel sorry for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instinctively opened her mouth to respond,but then she saw Cedric slowly lift his eyes,something broken flickering behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re my wife.&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice trembled, as if the words themselves hurt him. Daniela watched as he took a long, steadying breath before quietly asking, &#34;Is your kindness towards me all just pity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was aware that Daniela had lost her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also understood that, without those three years,Daniela&#39;s feelings for him now were barely there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But still, hearing those words stung more than he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was shaken, upset in a way he couldn&#39;t quite explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed, her demeanor rational and calm.She studied Cedric&#39;s face and said plainly, &#34;Didn&#39;t you already know? It&#39;s not entirely/pity, but there is some of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t one. for lying. She wasn&#39;t good at it either. If Cedric&#39;s leg injury hadn&#39;t been because of her, she&#39;d feel much more at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, your injury was indeed because of me,wasn&#39;t it? Whether it&#39;s out of pity or not, it&#39;s just a label, with no real meaning. If you find that term uncomfortable, I&#39;ll change it. How doesthat sound?&#34;</p>
