                <p>Nikolas stood there, completely at a loss. Daniela&#39;s words didn&#39;t make sense to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their worlds didn&#39;t overlap, not even a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, one thing had become crystal clear-she was doing this for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That truth pushed him into action. Eventually, he tracked Cedric down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This started because of me. You&#39;re part of the McCoy family, too. You wouldn&#39;t want to see it fall apart over all this, would you?&#34; Nikolas said quickly,trying to appeal to reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With paint smudged on his arms and shirt,Cedric wiped his hands on a rag and replied without looking up, &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer stunned Nikolas into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a hint of hesitation on Cedric&#39;s face-he looked relaxed, even unconcerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seriously don&#39;t care about the McCoy fortune?That kind of money could change your life. You&#39;d have everything,&#34; Nikolas asked, struggling to believe Cedric shrugged. &#34;Not interested. If my wife hadn&#39;t come to Oiscoll, I wouldn&#39;t be here either. My definition of success has nothing to do with how much I own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, Nikolas watched him, unsure whether to believe what he was hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet something about Cedric&#39;s expression-honest,calm,unguarded-left no room for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Nikolas still staring, Cedric added, &#34;Look, I get it. I&#39;ll talk it over with my wife, but let&#39;s not drag this out. She&#39;s not after you, so stop poking at something that isn&#39;t a threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, Cedric paused just long enough to delive a final message. &#34;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m letting this slide because I&#39;m scared. I just don&#39;t have time for your drama. Whatever it is you&#39;re trying to win, it&#39;s all yours. I&#39;m not getting involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply,Cedric walked off,leaving only the sound of his footsteps behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas remained rooted to the spot, watching Cedric&#39;s silhouette fade into the distance. He didn&#39;t move for what felt like an eternity When he finally did, it was to spit bitterly at the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ground. &#34;He&#39;s just riding Daniela&#39;s coattails. What&#39;s he got to be so smug about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the house, Cedric found Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had not originally intended to escalate the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple warning, she believed, was often enough Push too hard, and even cowards turned dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing the moment, she turned to Carol and said, &#34;Let it go. Tell them to stand down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin tugged at Carol&#39;s lips. &#34;Watching these rich families implode never gets old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her playful jab, Daniela turned to Cedric.&#34;Expect a visit from Hamilton soon. Nikolas showNing up today wasn&#39;t random. Something&#39;s shifted in how the McCoy assets are being handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of speaking, Cedric tilted his head slightly to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A streak of blue paint ran across his cheek, and Daniela reached up without a word, wiping it clean with her thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did that do it?&#34; Cedric asked,trying to catch her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a short nod. Only then did Cedric speak up. &#34;I don&#39;t care about the McCoy legacy, but if you want me involved, I&#39;ll back you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the sharp-tongued man who&#39;d faced Nikolas earlier. In front of Daniela, he was soft-spoken and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; said Daniela. &#34;Focus on your own work. That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a passion for architecture that kept him grounded, Cedric smiled in agreement and started up the stairs without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Carol clicked her tongue.&#34;Can&#39;t think of a single person on this planet who would brush off a fortune like Cedric just did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out the barest smile, offering no comment in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she predicted turned out to be true. Three days later, Hamilton&#39;s secretary showed up to meet Cedric face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary went straight to the point. &#34;Mr. McCoy wants to formally acknowledge you. The announcement will happen later, but first, you&#39;ll need to change your last name and accept him publicly as your father. Once that&#39;s done, we&#39;ll arrange a senior role for you within McCoy Group. You and your wife will move into one of the McCoy family residences On top of that, since you weren&#39;t raised within the family, Mr. McCoy is offering compensation-two luxurious villas here in Oiscoll. These contracts transfer full ownership to you. The combined value exceeds a billion. If anything&#39;s unclear, I&#39;d be happy to explain further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beaming with practiced warmth, the secretary slid the contracts across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without touching the documents, Cedric looked out the window-Hamilton was seated in the cafe across from the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t he come in to say it himself?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed to catch the secretary off guard,but he recovered quickly. His smile returned,unfazed.&#34;Trivial matters like this are usually handled by me.Once you sign and call him &#39;Father,&#39; Mr. McCoy will make everything official. From then on, you&#39;ll be part of the McCoy family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced back down at the papers and gave a faint nod. &#34;Right. Just a trivial matter, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
