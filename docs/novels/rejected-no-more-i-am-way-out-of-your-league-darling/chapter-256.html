                <p>Katrina couldn&#39;t get an answer from Cedric, so she turned to Shirley for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Shirley seemed determined to keep her lips sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But under Katrina&#39;s relentless questioning, she finally relented. &#34;Cedric likes men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confession landed like a thunderbolt, leaving Katrina utterly stunned and scrambling to process it.&#34;Excuse me,what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley, sensing there was no point in sugarcoating, laid it out plainly. &#34;He told me himself. And I even had someone look into it-Cedric has never dated a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s nerves frayed as she pressed, &#34;Has he dated men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt a flicker of relief, but Shirley continued, &#34;His secretary? They&#39;ve been together for over ten years. Before that, they were classmates. And yes, he&#39;s a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly dismissed it. &#34;That hardly proves anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His driver, too,&#34; Shirley added. &#34;Another man who&#39;s been by his side for just as long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina bit her lip, stubbornly insisting, &#34;That still doesn&#39;t mean anything significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about Ryan?&#34; Shirley pressed. &#34;Cedric gets along with him too. Think about it-Cedric may seem distant, but he has close ties with many men. Women approach him all the time, given his status, but he&#39;s never chosen one. Why do you think that is?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina struggled to come up with a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Katrina, if you were a man with a good job, plenty of money, and lots of influence-everything looking perfect-but you never got married or even had a long-term girlfriend, what do you think that would mean?&#34; That doesn&#39;t prove he&#39;s into men,&#34; Katrina said, refusing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe, but doesn&#39;t it at least suggest he has little interest in women? I even hired a private investigator.Did you know all his secretaries are men? For a company of that size, it&#39;s practically unheard of! Not a single woman. In a country this big, where else would you find something like that? Doesn&#39;t that raise a flag?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rapid-fire explanation left Katrina in a daze. She faltered for a moment, barely managing to murmur, &#34;But Daniela is a woman, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s the exception, the only one,&#34; Shirley replied firmly. &#34;Even with Lillian, Cedric is distant. Maybe he doesn&#39;t see Daniela as a typical woman. To him, she&#39;s more like a man, someone strong enough to manage an empire that massive. She&#39;s anything but ordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sat in silence for a moment, only to realize Shirley had already hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that conversation still lingering in her mind, Katrina went back to observing Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed unbothered by her watchful gaze, as long as she didn&#39;t interfere with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days passed, and Joyce stormed into the house with tears streaming down her face as she vented her frustrations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When no one downstairs gave her the attention she craved, she marched upstairs to find Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;ve had enough! I want a divorce!&#34; Joyce burst out the moment she stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed, already weary, as Joyce launched into a tirade. &#34;Alexander doesn&#39;t love me at all! All he ever thinks about is work. He just got back from a trip two weeks ago, and now he&#39;s saying he has to leave again.I even checked-he barely traveled for business before. It&#39;s so obvious he&#39;s just avoiding me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out another sigh. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you to adjust your attitude last time? Did you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I did!&#34; Joyce shot back indignantly. &#34;I followed your advice-l even offered him a massage after work. And you know what he said? He didn&#39;t even look at me and just muttered something about not being into massages!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed yet again. &#34;And what happened next?&#34; &#34;Of course, I got mad! Mom, Alexander has completely changed. He&#39;s not the same person anymore. If I&#39;d known he&#39;d turn out like this, I would&#39;ve never married him. I&#39;m still young, and I didn&#39;t sign up for a marriage where I&#39;d feel so ignored. I&#39;m serious, Mom. I want a divorce. If this continues, don&#39;t be surprised if I have an affair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes widened in shock as she slapped Joyce&#39;s hand. &#34;Are you out of your mind? You can&#39;t just say things like that! If word gets out, your reputation will be ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pouted, her defiance apparent. &#34;Then you figure it out. I&#39;ve got my own money now. The first dividend from the robotics company just came in-over three million! I don&#39;t need the Bennett family anymore, so why should I be scared of Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s sudden confidence was fueled by the unexpected windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the robotics company&#39;s dividends weren&#39;t regular, the payouts were undeniably substantial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With three million already in her account, just a few more payouts would ensure she was well off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t about to live like a widow while still so young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander insisted on ignoring her, she&#39;d make her own fun elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all,Alexander would be the one losing face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While talking, Joyce transferred five hundred thousand to Katrina before asking, &#34;Where&#39;s Shirley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina nodded as she noticed the transfer. &#34;She&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s head snapped up at the response. &#34;She&#39;s gone? Wait, don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s done with Cedric,&#34; she asked, her eyes glinting with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She thinks Cedric might be into men,&#34; Katrina said, feeling like her luck couldn&#39;t get any worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes lit up with a mischievous glint.&#34;Oh,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then without another word, she headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the living room was alive with the hum of the TV. Cedric sat off to one side, his long fingers idly stroking the fluffy head of a little dog resting by his side.</p>
