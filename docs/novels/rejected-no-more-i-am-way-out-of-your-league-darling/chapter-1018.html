                <p>Josh and Jules were nearing the doorway, ready to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped out from behind Daniela, his cold gaze slicing toward the two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood beside him, arms folded, radiating a bold,unyielding stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there stood Hamilton, his face dark and heavy like storm clouds ready to burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio lined up behind Daniela, casting a subtle shadow over her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are! It&#39;s blazing hot outside, isn&#39;t it? You must be worn out. Come on in-we&#39;re just firing up the barbecue. Join us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the chill of their stares, Josh and Jules hunched instinctively as they stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From afar, the two looked like reluctant guests being hauled into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate stretched wide, its spacious lawn lit by warm string lights that gave it a welcoming glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol and the housekeeper tended the grill, soon ioined hy Nikolas as the preparations continued. Daniela reclined in a patio chair, smiling contentedly as she enjoyed a skewer of grilled meat. Cedric came over and said, &#34;There&#39;s too much smoke here. I&#39;ll cook you some steamed shrimp instead-you shouldn&#39;t overdo the barbecue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and headed indoors to prepare the shrimp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing a chance, Josh dragged his chair beside Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules settled on her other side without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them smirked, pleased with how they&#39;d flanked Daniela like a trap she couldn&#39;t slither out of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot Jules a quick look. Jules, in turn,slipped a hand into his pocket and brushed his fingers against the concealed poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Josh started, while Jules discreetly scattered a clear powder over the barbecue, its foul scent slowly spreading through the air. He hesitated,thinking surely even the most oblivious person would catch on by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whipped around, tense-only to see Daniela focused on Josh, as if nothing was amiss. When Daniela didn&#39;t react, Josh breathed out,tension easing. &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s been misunderstandings between us. We never intended to trouble you by showing up today.&#34; Daniela laughed softly. &#34;And if I told you that you were bothering me,would that have stopped you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut straight, no sugarcoating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh opened his mouth but fumbled for a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules quickly cut in, thrusting the barbecue toward Daniela with forced enthusiasm. &#34;You like joking,aren&#39;t you? If Josh and I made any mistakes in the past,I hope you&#39;ll be generous enough to let them go.Now that you&#39;re expecting, stress isn&#39;t good for you.We&#39;re hoping to move forward on better terms, which is why we came to clear the air. After all, we&#39;re family -no need to cling to old grudges. If you eat this skewer, I&#39;ll take it as a sign that you&#39;ve let our past mistakes slide. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules was rarely this chatty, but today he couldn&#39;t stop -driven by a desperate urge to get rid of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not eating that.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s voice cut through the air as he stepped forward and took the skewer from Jules. &#34;She&#39;s pregnant-barbecue&#39;s off-limits.I&#39;Ll have this instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nearly sprang to his feet. &#34;Hamilton, this one&#39;s for Daniela. I&#39;Ll make another for you if you&#39;re hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton eyed the skewer, turning it slightly.&#34;Why? Is there something special about this one? Am I not allowed to have it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sheen of sweat started forming on Jules&#39; brow. Josh stepped in. &#34;Jules, let Hamilton have it. Just grab another one for Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules shot Josh a look, who subtly shook his head, &#34;No need to fuss.&#34; Josh got up, picked another skewer from the grill, and handed it over.&#34;We&#39;ve got more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept his eyes on them, his eyebrows gradually drawing together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, took the skewer from Jules, and passed it to Hamilton.&#34;I prefer the one in your hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after that request that Hamilton handed his skewer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked at Daniela. &#34;Craving anything else?Cedric&#39;s rules are too tight. Just say it-I&#39;ll bring it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded toward the shrimp Carol was cooking.&#34;Those,&#34; she said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton walked over without hesitation to grab them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the skewer in hand, Daniela leaned back comfortably in her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; shoulders finally loosened. Daniela glanced at him. &#34;What&#39;s got you so nervous?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her unexpected question almost made Jules jump out of his seat. He used to chalk up Daniela&#39;s rise to pure luck, but after just thirty minutes in her presence, he sensed there was something far deeper-something he couldn&#39;t quite grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like she had read every move in advance,leaving him feeling like a puppet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, it made sense why even Hamilton, clever as he was, couldn&#39;t outsmart her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules silently vowed to steer clear of Daniela-before he ended up in deep trouble without even knowing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh flashed a grin at Daniela. &#34;Give this skewer a try -tell us if it&#39;s any good. Jules and I are getting old;barbecue doesn&#39;t sit well with usanymore.We just enjoy watching the younger ones dig in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules gave a quick nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a gentle smile, her demeanor inviting.She looked at Jules. &#34;I&#39;ve got a story for you. Want to hear it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face clouded over instantly. His thoughts screamed, &#34;Quit stalling-eat the skewer and drop dead already! What&#39;s with the storytelling now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules couldn&#39;t agree more with that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when he met Daniela&#39;s clear eyes, he found himself nodding before he could think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the moment he realized it, he was shocked. What had he just done?</p>
