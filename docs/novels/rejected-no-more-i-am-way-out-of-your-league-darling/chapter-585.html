                <p>Huey furrowed his brow. &#34;Are you saying we should fake a suicide attempt to create a media frenzy and turn public criticism onto Daniela? Maybe that will force her to show us some mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett didn&#39;t respond immediately, neither confirming nor denying the suggestion. He sat in silence, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after a lengthy pause, Hackett said, &#34;I was once the president of the assocation. Normally, I would take responsibility for this. But I need to care for my mother. I can&#39;t take any risks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear from his words. He was unwilling to put himself in jeopardy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the room filled with uneasy glances, Huey said boldly, &#34;Then I&#39;ll do it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief spark of approval flashed in Hackett&#39;s eyes, but he quickly masked it, maintaining a sad demeanor.&#34;Huey, are you certain about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey responded with a casual shrug, &#34;Yeah, why not? It&#39;s just about standing on the rooftop of the Elite Lux building, right? No big deal. I&#39;m not actually going to jump. I&#39;ve seen this tactic before. I once delayed paying some workers, and they staged a similar protest to force my hand. Just call the media, get some people to act distressed, buy trending spots, and hire a few internet trolls. Regardless of Elite Lux&#39;s influence, losing public support and customers could bring them down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett nodded, then quickly started delegating tasks to the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meeting concluded, Bruno and Marcus pulled Huey aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them had always been close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno looked seriously at Huey. &#34;You need to really think about this. The Elite Lux building is over 100stories.Are you sure you want to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus agreed. &#34;Exactly. If something goes wrong, it could cost you your life.&#34; Bruno continued, &#34;Hackett came up with the plan but isn&#39;t doing it himself. We all have families to think about. He&#39;s such a manipulator!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus added, &#34;Hackett&#39;s entertainment company was ruined by Daniela. He&#39;s financially devastated now.He&#39;s desperate. As the former president, he standing on that rooftop would actually make a bigger impact than you doing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey dismissed their concerns. &#34;Forget it. I owe Hackett from way back. He&#39;s always been cunning. Plus,it&#39;s just standing up there for a while. Nothing will happen. Hackett told me he&#39;s already arranged with 911.They&#39;ll set up safety measures below. Even if I slipped, I wouldn&#39;t be in real danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they parted ways, none noticed Hackett lurking nearby, his expression dark as he listened in on their entire conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the three had walked a considerable distance did Hackett emerge from hiding, swearing under his breath at their retreating figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you actually going to call 911?&#34; Tripp asked as he stepped up beside Hackett, adjusting his glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett turned, a sly grin forming. &#34;What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a luxurious overseas cosmetic surgery clinic, Alexander examined his reflection meticulously in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, he turned to the plastic surgeon. &#34;What&#39;s this here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pointed to a specific area on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon responded with a broad smile, &#34;Mr. Bennett, these things take time to heal. The fillers also need time to settle. We&#39;ve used only the finest materials for you. Just a littlepatience is required.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scowled. &#34;Why does it seem like my face is uneven?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon kept his composure, smiling professionally. &#34;Impossible. We&#39;re leaders in our field, and you are a valued client. We&#39;ve provided you with top-tier service. There shouldn&#39;t be any problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued to scrutinize his reflection. The doctor discreetly exitedthe room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, his assistánt approached, visibly anxious. &#34;What should we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor chuckled dismissively. &#34;What&#39;s there to be afraid of? We&#39;ll discharge him this afternoon. Once he leaves here, what happens next is no longer my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant hesitated, then said, &#34;But I accidentally used the wrong materials. The asymmetry might become more noticeable over time. What if he notices?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor shot a stern glance at his assistant. &#34;As long as you keep quiet, who&#39;s going to know? Just remember, I&#39;m regarded as one of the top cosmetic surgeons in the world. Keep this to yourself.If you let anything slip, you&#39;ll deeply regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, the assistant handled Alexander&#39;s discharge paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgeon, all smiles, reassured Alexander, &#34;Trust us, the materials will settle in perfectly. If you have any concerns later on, just give me a call. It was a pleasure serving you, and we hope to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor observed as Alexander&#39;s car gradually disappeared into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured, &#34;My wish is about to come true. It won&#39;t be long before I see this prestigious client once more.&#34;</p>
