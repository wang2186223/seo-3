                <p>The eleven ships contained Huey&#39;s entire fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His legs shook uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t decide whether this was just bad luck or if</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was behind the whole thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, he reached out to every contact he had,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hoping to recover the goods from the ships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey dialed Hackett&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett,dismissive of the situation, responded, &#34;What does Daniela have to do with this? Even Cedric couldn&#39;t pull something like this off. Eleven ships with hundreds of containers, worth billions. Do you really think Cedric has the power to do that? Even if he did,he couldn&#39;t sell it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey voiced his suspicion. &#34;What if it&#39;s Daniela instead of Cedric? She has connections overseas!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett laughed out loud. &#34;Huey, have you lost your senses? Daniela? She&#39;s insignificant! Do you believe she could hijack so many of your ships? If it were really her, I&#39;d cover your losses, no problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett burst into laughter on the phone. Huey looked down, saying, &#34;I just confronted Daniela today, and then, my ships were ambushed by pirates.How could that be a coincidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett chuckled. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll look into it, but with that much lost at sea, it&#39;s usually gone for good.Brace yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey spat,seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood by the hotel entrance, waiing for Cedric to finish with his foreign guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over half an hour later, Cedric finally appeared, and Huey&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A friend told Huey, &#34;No matter what you offer, those ships are gone for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey felt his heart drop. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They say you&#39;ve upset someone. The goods aren&#39;t coming back. Stop wasting your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Huey said, &#34;You&#39;ve been in this game for over fifty years. Don&#39;t you have any sway? This represents everything I&#39;ve worked for. Those raw materials are of no use to them. These are client orders, and if I mniss the deadline, I&#39;ll face heavy penalties! It will destroy me!&#34; The person on the other end paused for a moment,then said, &#34;I can&#39;t help you here. I don&#39;t have that kind of influence. You should find someone locally to produce a new batch and beg the person you&#39;ve angered for mercy. That might be your only shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sighed, ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to locate a factory to produce the goods,but where could he possibly find one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his days of monopoly, he&#39;d crush any competitor at the slightest challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, there wasn&#39;t even a small workshop available,let alone a factory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey looked up and saw Cedric had already departed with the foreign guests, leaving the area deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling defeated, he told his driver to head for Daniela&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric returned from the reception, he noticed Daniela holding a shivering stray puppy in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got ready to take the puppy to the vet, Huey showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not right now,&#34; Daniela said, pointing to Cedric behind her. &#34;Talk to Cedric.&#34; This time, Huey was more cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Cedric a quick glance before following Daniela as she walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, I know a great pet hospital with skilled doctors.Follow my car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s behavior now was utterly submissive, a sharp contrast to the arrogance he displayed at the banquet and his ruthless nature after being humiliated by Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puppy was taken to the hospital, and Cedric gently placed a coat over Daniela&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, today&#39;s incident was a misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m truly sorry! I spoke without thinking! I was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>incredibly drunk! Please don&#39;t hold it against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to face Huey, his brows furrowed in confusion. &#34;What exactly did you say?&#34; His voice carried an underlying menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s heart dropped. &#34;I forgot. It was a slip of the tongue, not intentional. Please, I&#39;m really sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, known for his appearances on financial channels, was typically arrogant and dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time he visited this pet hospital, he&#39;d even assaulted a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, his submissive behavior, almost bowing in front of them,was a gratifying sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned to Daniela in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t anticipated that the CEO of Elite Lux would be so powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, this was Huey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained calm as she took the puppy from the doctor and said to Huey, &#34;I told you,if you have a problem, talk to Cedric. It&#39;s pointless to speak to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey quickly responded, &#34;If talking to you is useless,then I have no one left to beg. Ms. Harper,it&#39;s all my fault. Please speak to whoever took my ships and ask them for mercy. If I lose these goods, I&#39;ll be ruined!&#34;He begged earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela instructed the vet, &#34;Give it a vaccine. I&#39;m keeping this dog.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vet, intimidated, glanced at Huey and asked nervously, &#34;What will youname your pet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Monster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s jaw dropped in shock. He couldn&#39;t fathom that the tiny puppy would have such a name.Monster? But there was no time for him to dwell on it. As the vet took the dog inside, Huey immediately begged Daniela. &#34;Ms. Harper, please, have mercy on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Huey, observing as he slowly knelt before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People moved about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, dressed casually, remained indifferent,her eyes emotionless. She wondered if her mother could see this. The ones who once inflicted harm upon her mother were now finally bowing to her.</p>
