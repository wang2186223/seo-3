                <p>Alexander felt like a coward next to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to emulate her calm and fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car became quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After another half hour, it stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Daniela were forced out. She complied and walked where they led her, while Alexander squirmed and kept asking, &#34;Do you know who I am? Do you know who she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, the leader slapped Alexander, knocking him to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why bring both?&#34; someone shouted from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An underling replied, &#34;This guy kept talking, so we brought him. Claims he&#39;s a CEO, but he&#39;s nothing special.We&#39;ll dump him later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, while you were away, Joyce couldn&#39;t clear her debt, so I brought her sister here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area fell silent fora long stretch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone opposite them, sounding shocked, asked, &#34;What did you say? Who did you bring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce&#39;s sister, Daniela Harper, head of Elite Lux. She&#39;s very wealthy. Joyce said we could get billions if we kidnapped her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock was met with a long silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another added quickly, &#34;Boss, I checked. Daniela is indeed wealthy, not simple at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came from the other side. Soon,rapid footsteps approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of dress shoes clicked against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, why come down here? It&#39;s just a woman.We-n</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scat-faced man was stunned. Their usually stern boss now appeared compliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fool! Didn&#39;t | tell you Joyce&#39;s debt are her own? Why involve innocent people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scar-faced man looked confused. &#34;But Joyce has no money. She helped us trap Daniela. Isn&#39;t that beneficial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their boss shouted back, &#34;No, it&#39;s not! Not at all! You fools almost caused a disaster. I&#39;ll deal with you later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this, he turned to Daniela with a warm smile, bowed slightly, and said, &#34;I&#39;m very sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her composure, her eyes twinkling as she looked at him. &#34;Logan, you&#39;ve been quite careless lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan Lee replied, &#34;It wasn&#39;t intentional. These fools haven&#39;t harmed you, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO,&#34;Daniela said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, Logan exhaled. &#34;I&#39;m glad. Seeing you from afar, I was so startled I thought | was seeing things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked slightly. &#34;Oh, really? I half expected you to flee the moment you spotted me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan touched his nose, acknowledging her point with an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her release, Alexander was still not awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The goons loaded him into an ambulance. Daniela checked her phone to find that Logan had transferred a substantial apology fee, which brought a small smile to her face. One of Logan&#39;s men grumbled quietly, &#34;Boss, we didn&#39;t even lay a hand on her, and we&#39;re suddenly dowr two hundred million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan watched Daniela&#39;s car pull away, his expression icy.&#34;Idiot. We nearly caused a huge issue. Daniela&#39;s supporters are not ones to mess with. We couldn&#39;t have disentangled from her without paying a steep price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man with the scar on his face tightened his grip in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p># was all due to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How else could they have squandered two hundred million?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mess was Joyce&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander later awoke in the hospital, he opened his eyes wide at the sight of Daniela sitting by his bed, absorbed in her phone.</p>
