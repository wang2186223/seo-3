                <p>Right after Josh left, the three McCoy brothers entered with grim expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh is beyond heartless!&#34; Brad burst out, visibly worked up. &#34;Victoria was a good woman. And he had Mason kill her without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head. &#34;He&#39;s completely lost it. Always acted like the perfect husband. Now that he was done using her, he tossed her aside. She gave him a son, for crying out loud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton crossed his arms. &#34;He even said the wedding&#39;s tomorrow. I&#39;m not going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not either,&#34; said Brad without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded. &#34;Count me out too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three turned to Daniela, expecting her to take a stand with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To their shock, she replied, &#34;I&#39;m going. I&#39;ve been living in Oiscoll for a while and haven&#39;t seen a local wedding before. Might as well see what it&#39;s like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Josh-once mocked for failing to lead McCoy Group-now stood proud as its head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent invitations far and wide, filling the guest list with Oiscoll&#39;s most notable names. It became the event of the season.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His young bride, dressed in a flowing gown, glided from guest to guest with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed to the side while Carol leaned in and whispered, &#34;Daniela, I just heard something wild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Felicia was the girl Mason fell hard for,&#34; said Carol.&#34;But she didn&#39;t feel the same. He never won her over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised an eyebrow and spotted Felicia across the crowd. The girl lifted her glass in a toast, her smile calm and sure. Daniela returned the gesture,amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s definitely not ordinary,&#34; said Daniela, watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the ceremony, just as Daniela was about to step out, she heard someone calling after her. She turned and saw Felicia hurrying over, lifting her dress slightly so she could walk faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry | couldn&#39;t welcome you properly today, Ms.Harper,&#34; Felicia said, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted a brow, her expression unreadable. Felicia dropped the hem of her dress and met her gaze. Daniela&#39;s sharp features stirred a quiet envy in her. But it wasn&#39;t the kind that made her insecure. She knew better than to rely on beauty alone. Victoria had been beautiful too-and look how that ended. A woman needed more than a pretty face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was exactly why Felicia wanted to move closer to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Daniela didn&#39;t just have beauty. She had brains too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days after the wedding, they met again-this time at a quiet cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia arrived in a fresh couture dress,all grace and polish. She offered a smile and spoke with care.&#34;Ms.Harper, thank you for meeting me. I know this was short notice, but I have a proposal I hope you&#39;ll consider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela accepted a glass of water from Cedric,took a sip, and set it down. Her eyes followed Felicia&#39;s ġaze as it drifted past her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught the direction of it and gave a knowing smile. &#34;It&#39;s best not to crave what doesn&#39;t belong to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia turned her eyes back to her, lips curled slightly &#34;You&#39;ve always been impressive. When I saw the man at your side, I wondered if he could be shared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t blink. She took another drink. &#34;That won&#39;t happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia gave a slow nod but couldn&#39;t stop herself from peeking toward Cedric again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had a quiet pulL. He wasn&#39;t like Josh, who was already old. He wasn&#39;t like Mason either,emotional and impulsive. There was something about Cedric-something steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her attention back with a sigh. &#34;If I had met him earlier, I might&#39;ve taken a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice remained cool. &#34;I don&#39;t compete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And truly, Cedric&#39;s quiet presence only confirmed she&#39;d made theright choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia let out a laugh, eyes warm. &#34;I was wrong before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re even more intriguing than he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back, unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia kept going. &#34;Mason once tried to win me over,but I never cared for him. It was always his father I was drawn to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother with niceties. &#34;Josh might hold the assets, but that&#39;s not who you want. It&#39;s his power that interests you.&#34; Felicia nodded, completely unbothered. &#34;Smart women are the best company. Daniela, we should work together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond right away. She just studied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia added, &#34;You helped Victoria through her divorce. Now that I&#39;m Mrs. McCoy, I have my own stakes at the table. I&#39;m ready to take a risk. Would you consider partnering with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile. &#34;You&#39;re not Victoria. And if I&#39;m remembering correctly, Josh had you sign a prenup, didn&#39;t he? If you leave him by the book, you walk away with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia&#39;s eyes gleamed with respect. &#34;I knew you were the right person. You&#39;re indeed smart.&#34;</p>
