                <p>Hamilton stood there, stunned, completely thrown off by what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who in their right mind would go this far just to send a message that no one could touch their partner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just irrational, it was borderline obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more certain he became that Cedric and Daniela were a terrible match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, dramatic flings and shallow declarations of &#34;love&#34; held no weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet here was Daniela, throwing money around like it meant nothing, all to win Cedric&#39;s fav/or.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what happened when the thrill wore off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Daniela fell for someone else? If Daniela had been ordinary, maybe he could&#39;ve overlooked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t. She was stunning, and men were drawn to her like moths to flame. She didn&#39;t have to do a thing. They&#39;d fall over themselves just to get her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she gave someone that kind of unwavering loyalty, what man wouldn&#39;t have fallen for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was already completely under her spell,following her lead without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she ever lost interest, Cedric would probably offer the entire McCoy Group to her just to make her stay by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This overblown romantic nonsense was an insult to everything the McCoy family stood for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t going to sit back and watch it unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Cedric was his son, Hamilton would not allowed them to be together.Daniela was dangerously smart, and that only made her more of a threat. If Cedric fell for her trap, he&#39;d be drained dry and left with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s thoughts churned as he narrowed his eyes at Daniela. &#34;What you did today put the McCoy family at a disadvantage. I won&#39;t let it slide.You can forget ever becoming one of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words came out more than a warning; it was a verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed carelessly, &#34;Oh, calm down. I never had any interest in joining your overrated dynasty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice rose, tight with fury. &#34;Like it or not,Cedric is one of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head and answered, &#34;Is that so? He never thinks of himself as one of you.One more thing -learn to tame that ego before it strangles you.Looks like it already did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Daniela turned around and walked off as the smirk lingered on her face. Nikolas was nearby, quietly taking in every second of their exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the fact that the McCoy family had taken a hit today, watching Daniela put Hamilton in his place sparked something dark and unspoken within him,a sense of twisted satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze followed Daniela&#39;s retreating figure, and for a fleeting moment, he wished it had been him she defended so fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were family. He and Cedric shared the same blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric had earned that kind of loyalty from her,why not him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure he could do better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint grin crossed his face as he followed behind Hamilton,vanishing into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached Oiscoll, Alexander didn&#39;t waste any time and headed straight for Hamilton. Hamilton lounged in a grand, gold-trimmed chair that resembled a throne. From where Alexander stood, it felt like he was staring up at a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Alexander, I take it?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s lip curled in distaste. &#34;Hard to believe Daniela ever had such poor judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab struck like a punch to the gut, wiping the smile right off Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tried to explain, but Hamilton didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;You think you measure up to Cedric? You&#39;re not even in the same league. If Daniela was willing to stoop that low, maybe she&#39;s not as picky as I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hamilton turned to his secretary. &#34;Start scouting for men who resemble Cedric and Alexander. Send them all to hover around Daniela. Sooner or later, one of them will catch her eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; the secretary replied promptly. Then Hamilton turned his attention back to Alexander with finality. &#34;That&#39;ll be all. You can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton waved Alexander off, clearly unmoved by his plain looks and transparent attempt to appear brilliant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, men like Alexander had no future,and certainly no seat at his table. He had no interest in working with such a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was stunned for a moment, but he didn&#39;t leave. &#34;Mr. McCoy, you can find a dozen men who look like me. That&#39;s easy. But I&#39;ve known Daniela for years. That connection? You can&#39;t replicate that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then added, &#34;On the way here, someone mentioned you disapprove of Daniela being with Cedric. Honestly? I get it. A woman like her, sharp,independent, doesn&#39;t fit the mold. In our world, most families want a soft-spoken wife who knows when to stay quiet. Daniela isn&#39;t like that. And yeah, my father had the same fear. That&#39;s what caused the rift between me and Daniela.&#34; Hamilton scoffed, &#34;What, you think I&#39;ll end up regretting it like your father did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; Alexander answered quickly. &#34;You&#39;re leagues above him. You built an empire, no one comes close. Your judgment, your foresight?Unmatched.See, I didn&#39;t grow up with power like Cedric did. I had to fight for every inch. That&#39;s why l need someone like Daniela by my side. But Cedric?He&#39;s got you. With your guidance, he could dominate the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander knew how to play the game. He&#39;d mastered the art of saying exactly what someone needed to hear.</p>
