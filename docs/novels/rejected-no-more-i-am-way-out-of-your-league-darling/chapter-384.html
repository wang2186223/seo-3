                <p>Joyce had been confined in a dark cell for five torturous days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to believe that she might not make it out alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, she even caught herself hoping for death as an escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Doug wouldn&#39;t allow her to die. He kept her wrists chained to the headboard, torturing her while giving her IV drips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold fluid flowed through her bloodstream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tilted her head back. Her body had become so numb that it barely responded anymore. Tears slowly streamed down her face as she silently promised herself that if she survived, Daniela would one day experience everything she had endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t remember how many times she had lost consciousness or howv many times she had come to. In one of her brief moments of awareness, she glanced down at Doug, who was torturing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doug, aren&#39;t you curious about how it feels to fuck Daniela?&#34; Doug stopped his actions, looked up, and squinted at her. &#34;Joyce, are you trying to get yourself killed and take me down with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened, making Joyce&#39;s heart squeeze in pain. &#34;Daniela is great, sure, but you&#39;re not bad either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doug, I was raised the countryside. Daniela is different. When Brylee was pregnant with Daniela,she supposedly consumed every supplement imaginable.As a result, Daniela turned out with flawless skin and striking looks. She is an exceptional beauty. You take pride in possessing every woman you encounter, but until now, your conquests have been nothing more than ordinary flings. Doesn&#39;t that bother you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was on the verge of snapping at Joyce, but he hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In comparison to Daniela, the women he had been with truly did seem ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was someone he hadn&#39;t been able to touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A menacing spark flickered in Doug&#39;s eyes, and Joyce noticed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out on the bed, and felt herself nearing a breakdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered his earlier warning. If she humiliated him,her life would end right there on that bed. Struggling to breathe, Joyce whispered, &#34;I can help you. Just don&#39;t kill me, and I&#39;ll help you capture Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug looked at her with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce continued, &#34;I&#39;m at your mercy. I can&#39;t escape. If I fail, you can end my life then. You&#39;re done with me,aren&#39;t you? Are you scared you won&#39;t be able to handle Daniela? Didn&#39;t you boast that once a woman has been with you for a night, she&#39;ll never desire anyone else? Are you not interested in putting that to the test?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug stayed kneeling, motionless for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Joyce was using Daniela as a bargaining chip to save herself, yet the idea of conquering Daniela was too captivating to dismiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he glanced at Joyce these days, he envisioned Daniela instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of Daniela under him excited him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was convinced that if Daniela agreed to be with him,he would leave behind all his harshness and treat her with tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce watched Doug rise and leave. Shortly after, a team of doctors hurried in from the corridor. As exhaustion overwhelmed her,one final thought surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suffering had stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Joyce approached Alexander, her face still marked by scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doug is aware of our actions,&#34; Joyce said, her thick sunglasses barely hiding her new injuries. She casually adjusted them and told Alexander, &#34;I&#39;ve struck a deal with Doug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at Joyce without saying a word.Rarely did anyone who crossed Doug get away so easily. &#34;What did you promise him?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce paused to sip her coffee. Her trembling hands,visible up close, revealed the extent of her injuries.&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her name, Alexander felt a tightening in his chest. &#34;What did you say?&#34; he asked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doug wants Daniela. Once it&#39;s settled, he&#39;s offering me three hundred million as my divorce settlement.With that money, Bennett Group would no longer face any financial problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed, and his brow furrowed.&#34;Daniela wouldn&#39;t get involved with Doug. And you expect me to believe you&#39;d actually put that three hundred million into Bennett Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce flashed a faint smile. &#34;You&#39;re right about the first part.Daniela wouldn&#39;t willingly be with Doug. But what if she thought Doug was Cedric? I know an expert hypnotist. As for the money, I wouldn&#39;t help unless I had something to gain. After my divorce from Doug, I&#39;ll need a reliable partner. Marry me, and I&#39;ll make sure Bennett Group gets the support it needs,whenever it&#39;s needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face grew more gloomy. He remained silent for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his reluctance, Joyce let out a mocking laugh.&#34;What, you need this long to decide? Are you still attached to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sneered, covering her mouth as a scornful smile spread across her bruised face. &#34;Since when did you become so sentimental, Alexander? Or do you think I&#39;m not suitable to be your wife? Consider the three hundred million, Alexander. Look at where you stand now.Finding someone like me is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so don&#39;t let it slip by.&#34;</p>
