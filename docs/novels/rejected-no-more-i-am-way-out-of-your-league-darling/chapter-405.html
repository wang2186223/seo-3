                <p>Nina&#39;s mind wandered in silence, lost in its own maze of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the door, which had been shut tight, creaked open, startling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran through her, making her body shudder beneath the seductive lingerie she wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim glow of the room threw eerie shadows across the walls, and fear gripped Nina&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Linden step in, his lecherous grin echoing in her ears, sending an uncomfortable shiver down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The belt fell to the floor with a gentle thud.His shirt was hastily pulled apart, revealing a round belly beneath. In the pale light, she saw Linden tilting his head,pushing back what little hair remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disgust washed over her, sharp and unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his chubby fingers brushed against the white sheets, Nina&#39;s body trembled more violently, regret creeping up from the depths of her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The musty scent of damp clothes, a smell she had come to associate with Linden, immediately hit her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dread and regret surged together, but she realized too late that there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s pants dropped to the floor in an instant,exposing his faded underwear, and with it, every part of his vile nature stood laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear and shock overtook Nina, her eyes growing wide. She sat up on the bed, instinctively preparing to flee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, her hair was yanked back, tugged harshly by an unforgiving grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain shot through her scalp, sharp and burning.  A cruel sneer stretched across Linden&#39;s face. &#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going? This is exactly what we agreed upon. The night is young, and I&#39;ve got all the time in the world to enjoy you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next instant, Linden&#39;s hands tore through Nina&#39;s top, the sound of fabric ripping making her body flinch in dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream ripped from her throat, shrill and desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of calling for her mother, for Natalie,flooded her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret flooded her-she wished she could undo it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Escape was all she could think about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately, she darted towards the door, only to realize it was locked from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling uncontrollably, she pressed her back against the door, her eyes locking with Linden&#39;s revolting smile as his gaze wandered over her form. His laughter echoed, the sight of his crooked,yellow teeth sickening her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina clamped her hand over her mouth, fighting the urge to vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight before him drove Linden into a blind rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed forward, grabbing a fistful of Nina&#39;s hair again, forcing her mouth shut with a cruel pinch through the veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you want to pretend you&#39;re some virtuous woman? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure you have a good time,&#34; he whispered the words in a cold, taunting breath,his lips brushing her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s legs buckled, her body betraying her as it went limp with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could gather herself, the sound of fabric tearing reached her ears again. Her eyes widened, a cold shiver crawling across her lower body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a brutal motion, Linden lifted her onto the bed,and as she recoiled, he pressed forward, his hands shamelessly reaching for her feet. He lowered his head greedily,placing kiss after kiss on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s mind shattered in that instant, and a scream of pure terror erupted from her as she cried, &#34;Mom!Mom,I regret it! Please save me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the weight of her choices crashed down on her, and the regret was suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body fought, but Linden&#39;s lips-those repulsive,vile things-continued to press against her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a twisted, longing tone. &#34;Do you even know how long l&#39;ve obsessed over you? You&#39;ve always been like a star in the sky, unreachable, and here l am, the ugliest thing in the gutter. Just thinking about you felt like a sin. But when you agreed, it made me so happy. You were the most beautiful girl on campus, everyone wanted you. You never knew about the years of yearning from someone like me,did you? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s body stilled, her struggles coming to an abrupt halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mistaking her stillness for compliance, Linden&#39;s excitement flared as he pressed a gentle kiss to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flat against the bed, Nina&#39;s mind emptied, consumed by a hollow void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>School?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of yearning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit her like a heavy blow: the woman Linden desired wasn&#39;t her-it was Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began to flow down Nina&#39;s cheeks, pooling beneath the veil that clung to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a laugh escaped her, sharp and bitter,trembling through her body as if to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s insistence on the veil suddenly made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Natalie had refused, Elyse had sent her in Natalie&#39;s place, to sleep with this man. Nina had always known she was unloved, but this-the betrayal-was something she had never imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s purity was sacred, untouchable. But what about hers? Was her innocence so easily discarded,so unimportant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she truly just something to be used, something so easily overlooked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears of regret flowed freely down Nina&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no amount of regret would change what was already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned to her fate, Nina lay still on the bed, staring blankly at the white ceiling, feeling Linden&#39;s lips trailing up her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of it all crushed her spirit, and she whispered, &#34;You can call me whoever you want, but just keep your promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this nightmare, she hoped Linden would save Cedric. At least then, some of the pain would have purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s lips pressed against her skin as he murmured, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Once we&#39;re done, I&#39;ll head straight to the hospital and take Cedric&#39;s life.&#34;</p>
