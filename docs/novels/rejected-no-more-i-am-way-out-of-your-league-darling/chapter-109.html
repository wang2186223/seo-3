                <p>Ronald reclined on the bed, his face swollen and contorted in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt,observing the grim scene, turned to Caiden and spoke with evident frustration. &#34;Did you witness the day&#39;s events? Daniela, your own flesh and blood, came despite not wanting to deal with your shit.Yet,one word from you, and she was here. She respects us as family. But Joyce? That ungrateful brat isn&#39;t even ours and couldn&#39;t give a shit about us. And Katrina? What&#39;s there to say? She swung a goddamn knife at us! Who the hell does that? We never imagined she&#39;d actually go through with it, but she did. Look at Ronald and me -sure, we&#39;re just your brothers. But think about our mother.Even if she were a stranger, an elderly woman on the street, one simply does not strike someone of her age. That&#39;s just common decency!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled heavily and continued, &#34;We always thought your ex-wife was too assertive, too formidable. Had she been here, this chaos wouldn&#39;t have unfolded like this. And the family finances? Are they even under your control anymore? As the CEO of a publicly traded company, why are we scraping together funds for hospital bills? Do you really think Daniela isn&#39;t crushed by all of this? Let&#39;s face it-your comfortable life today is built on the foundation of your late wife&#39;s diligence. Instead of safeguarding Daniela&#39;s future, you&#39;re being swayed by another woman&#39;s machinations. If I were Daniela, I wouldn&#39;t recognize you as my father either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton then fixed Caiden with a cold, piercing stare.&#34;What are your plans to address this? We&#39;ll refrain from involving the police for your sake, but we cannot ignore this. If you&#39;re planning to let this shit slide, don&#39;t you dare call me Mom ever again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton had never addressed Caiden in such a harsh tone, and her biting words struck him like a punch to the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, Caiden exited the room and made his way to the hallway, where he succumbed to his emotions,weeping uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day was marked by Ronald&#39;s surgery.Anxious, Caiden attempted to reach out to Daniela,only to be informed by her secretary that she was tied up in a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela got back to him, the operation had concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his voice quivering from relief, Caiden expressed his gratitude. &#34;Daniela, I can&#39;t thank you enough! The  surgeon you recommended was exceptional. It all went perfectly! No need to worry about a thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a brief, indifferent &#34;Hmm&#34; before disconnecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter taste replaced Caiden&#39;s fleeting smnile,as he acknowledged his own role in the unfolding events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to spread the positive news,he called home, only to be met with Joyce&#39;s harsh, resentful tone. &#34;Oh, the surgery was successful? That&#39;s unfortunate. They deserved to fucking rot for what they put Mom through!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chilly edge, Joyce reminded him before hanging up. &#34;And remember, Dad-you still owe me money. I expect it back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shut his eyes, a single tear trailing down his cheek in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of the room, Peyton observed him and let out a scornful chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the hospital stay of Peyton, Ronald, and Wyatt,neither Katrina nor Joyce paid a visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden found himself borrowing money from friends to manage the overwhelming hospital bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He no longer sought Daniela&#39;s assistance, burdened by a deep sense of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To minimize discord, he arranged for their relocation to a modest apartment in a different neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were settled, he ventured back to the villa to collect some personal items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden neared the front door, the sound of laughter echoed from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blend of joyful voices with the scent of a meal being prepared struck him harshly-it seemed like a bitter mockery after enduring countless days filled with fatigue, sleepless nights, and the stress of caregiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His appearance was disheveled, his beard unkempt from days without proper care. When he entered,Joyce looked at him with a grimace, her expression piercing his already tender spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell, Dad? You smell so bad I&#39;m about to gag! Did you roll around in a dumpster or what?&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze turned to Katrina, who was engrossed in a television show. She didn&#39;t bother to look his way;her expression was icy, stripped of the warmth and affection she once radiated towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Caiden made his way up the stairs, craving the relief of washing the dirt and weariness from his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refreshed after the shower, he was about to leave the room when he noticed the safe was open. Inside,nothing remained but the stark, empty void of the once-secured container.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rooted to the spot, Caiden stared into the empty safe</p>
