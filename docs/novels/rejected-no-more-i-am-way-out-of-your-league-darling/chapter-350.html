                <p>Cedric wasted no time in seeking out his hacker friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Data lines looped endlessly on the computer screen but Daniela&#39;s information was still scarce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t quite crack it,&#34; Killian Reynolds muttered through a mouthful of sandwich, clearly irked. &#34;Cedric,where did you find this girlfriend? She&#39;s incredible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sighed.&#34;Are you sure this profile is fake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian nodded confidently. &#34;It&#39;s fake. A casual user wouldn&#39;t notice anything, but for hackers like me, the layers of security scream custom protective programming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric squinted thoughtfully.=&#34;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be the best hacker in the country? Giving up already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m the best in the country, sure, but what can I do when the other side is the best in the world? Cedric, are you certain Ryan&#39;s the one who built these hidden codes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one else around Daniela is close to her level of computer skills,&#34; Cedric replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian took another bite of his sandwich, shaking his head. &#34;Then it&#39;s nothim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan&#39;s good, no doubt but I know his style. His codes are complex but not impossible to crack. This one,though, is deceptive. It looks simple on the surface, but so hard to figure out to decode.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric arched a brow. &#34;Maybe Ryan&#39;s leveled up while you&#39;ve been slacking off. He is one of the top experts in the world, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian scratched his head, a sheepish grin forming. &#34;Really? So much progress in such a short time? Let me give it another shot.&#34; Determined not to concede defeat, Killian&#39;s fingers danced across the keyboard with relentless precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across town, an alert popped up on Ryan&#39;s screen. &#34;Daniela, someone&#39;s trying to breach the program you wrote. They&#39;re after your profile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela strolled over, her gaze flicking to the monitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intruder wasn&#39;t half bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan quickly began typing a counterattack, his movements swvift and precise. Beside him, Daniela casually placed a takeout order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the delivery arrived, Ryan gestured for Daniela to step in and take his place for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the screen and with a few seemingly random keystrokes, she effortlessly resolved the issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; Ryan asked, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, already unpacking their meal. &#34;Yeah. Now eat before it gets cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan stared at the screen, typing a few more lines to double-check before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Cedric&#39;s place, he stood behind Killian, watching the battle unfold onscreen. At first, it seemed like an even match. But then, without warning, Killian&#39;s system crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only had his hacking attempt failed, but his computer was now riddled with a dummy program so absurd it seemed like a taunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian&#39;s pride took a nosedive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had never seen anyone humiliate Killian so thoroughly in the cyber world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric looked down at Killian, he noticed Killian&#39;s expression had darkened significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian shut his eyes in frustration, then turned his head sharply. &#34;Cedric, whoever&#39;s on the other end, I swear on my life, it&#39;s not Ryan!&#34; Just as Killian finished speaking, the rebooted computer flashed a mocking text in bold. &#34;Get lost, idiot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian took a deep breath and closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, his gaze was still burning with fury. &#34;I swear, I&#39;m going to kill whoever&#39;s on the other side! Did you see that, Cedric? They&#39;re mocking me! Toying with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next week, Killian launched counterattack after counterattack, calling in favors from every contact in his hacker network.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outcome?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he saw were rows of computers being counter-hacked, along with those bold, mocking words. &#34;Get lost,idiot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric watched Killian slump in his chair, utterly defeated. Even his elite allies had been outmaneuvered.Cedric leaned back, lost in thought. Was Ryan really this good?</p>
