                <p>Hamilton was clearly irritated that Damon had ignored his earlier call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice oozed sarcasm from the other end. &#34;What&#39;s the deal? You enjoying yourself so much at Daniela&#39;s place that you forgot how to pick up the phone? Or did you forget what your last name is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light laugh escaped Damon. &#34;Come on, Father. Don&#39;t be like that. I just didn&#39;t see your call. That&#39;s all it was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irritation in Hamilton&#39;s voice sharpened as he said, &#34;I sent you there to find Daniela&#39;s weak spots. Any progress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon let out a breath. &#34;I&#39;ve got nothing. No leads. No results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s patience thinned instantly.&#34;Why am I not surprised? I should&#39;ve known better. Be back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Damon sit up straight. &#34;Tomorrow? Seriously? Can&#39;t it be the day after? Cedric&#39;s making barbecue, and I&#39;ve been dying to try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You show up tomorrow,&#34; Hamilton retorted,cutting him off.′′Or I swear, I&#39;ll toss you in a pot and make barbecue out of you myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon didn&#39;t dare say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Damon returned home in a hurry, only to find that Hamilton hadn&#39;t shown up yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon picked up his phone and called right away. &#34;Father, can you come home now? I&#39;m not planning to stay for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside the car, Hamilton rolled his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s the problem now? Food not good enough for your royal taste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon started to explain.&#34;It&#39;s just that Daniela said-&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t say her name,&#34; Hamilton interjected instantly. His temper flared at the sound of it. &#34;I don&#39;t give a damn what Daniela said. Listen to me, Damon. You&#39;re a McCoy. Try not to forget that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Hamilton ended the call with a sharp click of finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front seat, Kohen watched his father through the rearview mirror. &#34;Did Damon tick you off again,Father? I&#39;ve said it before. Letting him get close to Daniela was never a good idea. He&#39;s admired her for years. The second he got near her, staying loyal to us became impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton answered with a cold snort and turned his eyes to the scenery outside the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car pulled up, Kohen said, &#34;Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton turned his head and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen took a steady breath and said, &#34;I know you&#39;ve always thought I got married too young. I married someone you never approved of. You&#39;ve carried that disappointment for a long time. But I&#39;ve always been clear about where I stand-I&#39;ve given everything to this family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face gave away nothing. &#34;What exactly are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his back straight and voice firm, Kohen continued, &#34;Damon&#39;s loyalty is clearly with Daniela. But I&#39;m not like him. I&#39;ve never forgotten who I am. I&#39;m your son. I belong to this family. Let me go to Daniela&#39;s place instead. I&#39;ll get you the information you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze narrowed as he studied Kohen closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of all five of his sons, Kohen was the one he felt least connected to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always found Kohen too cold, too calculating, and completely indifferent toward his own siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when he was younger, Kohen stirred up a scandal by marrying a bar girl, dragging the McCoy family into gossip that swept across all of Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hamilton were ever forced to name an heir, Kohen would be the very last name on his list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think about it,&#34; Hamilton replied, voice clipped and cool. Kohen dipped his head in acknowledgment.&#34;Understood. I&#39;ll do whatever you decide, Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side by side, they stepped into the house without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Damon heard them arrive, he came hurrying over. &#34;Father, what did you need to see me for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was already in a foul mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all five of his sons, Damon had always been the one he favored most. He was clever, sharp, and full of potential, but all of it was wasted on useless distractions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw tightened with frustration. &#34;So now I need permission just to call you over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon kept his tone light, wanting to end this quickly. &#34;Father, just say what you need. Keep it short,alright?&#34; Dinner at Daniela&#39;s place was set for seven, and Damon didn&#39;t want to miss Cedric&#39;s cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That set Hamilton off. &#34;Still hung up on that barbecue? Fine! I had the chef make some here too. Or do you think whatever Cedric cooks tastes better than what our top chef prepares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without skipping a beat, Damon replied, &#34;Honestly, there&#39;s no comparison. You haven&#39;t tasted Cedric&#39;s cooking. He prepares everything himself-from scratch. Everything is spotless, organic, and balanced. Plus,he&#39;s got some kind of secret sauce. What he makes is way better than anything we have here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice exploded with fury. &#34;Are you trying to make me lose mny mind? You&#39;re staying here tonight.That&#39;s final!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That burst of anger knocked all the excitement out of Damon. His shoulders dropped as the thought of dinner vanished from his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, they sat at the table in strained silence. Damon barely touched his food, his expression drained of any joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him sulk across the table ruined Hamilton&#39;s appetite completely. With a sigh, he reached into his briefcase and tossed a document from Arthur right in front of Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon picked it up and unfolded the page. The moment he saw what it was, his whole body stiffened.&#34;Father, how do you have this?&#34; Hamilton&#39;s eyes locked on him. &#34;So you do recognize it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Damon nodded.&#34;Yeah. My psych teacher taught me the same things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned in slightly. &#34;Then tell me what it means. What&#39;s this all about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s eyes scanned the paper, then lit up with recognition. &#34;It&#39;s about Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Anything in there I can use against her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Damon paused. Then a sly smile crept across his face. &#34;If I give you what you want, can I go back to Daniela&#39;s villa afterward?&#34;</p>
