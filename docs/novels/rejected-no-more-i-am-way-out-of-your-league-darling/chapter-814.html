                <p>Cedric was in the kitchen, carefully tending to the stove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat comfortably in the living room, eyes on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper offered, &#34;Sir, you&#39;ve been working at the company all day. Why not take a break? I can handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hands moved with precision as he smiled at the pan. &#34;I appreciate it, but I&#39;d rather prepare my wife&#39;s meals myself. You can just lend a hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper chuckled, handing him a bottle of oil. &#34;Aren&#39;t you worn out,sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric rose early each day to jog before starting on breakfast. He would tell the chef in the company cafeteria the dishes for lunch. Evenings didn&#39;t slow him down. While others might unwind, Cedric would head to the kitchen again,this time making dinner not just for Daniela but also for Carol and whoever else was at the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him, the housekeeper couldn&#39;t help wondering how long he could keep that pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; Cedric replied. &#34;It&#39;s just part of my day. I wouldn&#39;t feel right if I didn&#39;t cook for her myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;She never complains about food. She always seems easy to please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t picky. She&#39;d eat whatever was served without fuss. Before Cedric came, the housekeeper used to guess her preferences based on whatever was left untouched on the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when something didn&#39;t taste quite right, Daniela rarely said so. But lately, the housekeeper noticed small changes. Ever since Cedric moved in, Daniela had begun mentioning little things she&#39;d like to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never saw those requests as burdens.He simply listened and adjusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift made the housekeeper feel oddly displaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t much left for her to do aside from keeping the shared areas in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,she liked the peace here and hoped to stay here for as long as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cedric chatted in the kitchen, Daniela answered her phone in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain hammered against the windows, steady and loud. Cedric looked over briefly before turning back to stir the pot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody noticed that Nikolas was still outside.The man who once flaunted his name now stood at the front door,soaked to the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol stepped inside and shut the door behind her, she glanced at Daniela. &#34;Hey, why&#39;s Nikolas standing out there like that? He looks miserable.&#34; Daniela paused mid-bite, then glanced at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, and the shared expression between them was hard tomiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had both completely forgotten him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the housekeeper opened the door and brought him in, Nikolas sneezed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His once-flawless hair clung to his forehead in damp strands. His eyes were red from the cold.Water ran down from his expensive suit, pooling beneath his shoes as the floor began to glisten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you forget I was still here?&#34; Nikolas raised his voice,thick with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, who had never gone out of her way to comfort anyone but Cedric, didn&#39;t look up from her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you&#39;re shouting at?&#34; She had already finished her meal and now stared at Nikolas&#39; drenched figure with a clear look of disapproval.&#34;You just got kicked out of the McCoy family. Don&#39;t come in here acting entitled. Mind your tone, or l&#39;ll personally show you the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose from her seat and headed toward the living room. She didn&#39;t bother glancing back. It was obvious she didn&#39;t want anything more to do with the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen. Watching her walk away without hesitation made his chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had risked everything for her, even his place in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Daniela showed no trace of empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she so heartless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weren&#39;t he and Cedric at least related by blood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if none of that mattered to her.If he wanted help now, it was clear that Cedric was his only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his jaw and looked toward Cedric. Cedric met his gaze, but there was nothing he could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oiscoll&#39;s cold spells are brutal,&#34; said Nikolas, voice cracking. &#34;If you send me out now, tomorrow&#39;s headlines will call you the brother who left me to die in the street. Is that what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he spoken than a quiet laugh drifted from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, annoyed, and saw Carol chuckling. Even Daniela cracked a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, completely defeated. They weren&#39;t even trying to hide their amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they find this funny?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking for much,&#34; he said stiffly. &#34;Just a room.And...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nearly said more-something about needing help or a servant-but Daniela&#39;s cold stare stopped him in place. She didn&#39;t need to say a word. Her expression was warning enough. &#34;Just a room,&#34; he said again. He swallowed hard and added, &#34;It&#39;s only temporary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had finally accepted that Daniela wasn&#39;t going to lift a finger. There was no point expecting warmth from someone like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to Cedric, eyes pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric took a moment, then said, &#34;I need to check with my wife. Give me a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at him in disbelief. Rage burned through his embarrassment. &#34;I&#39;m only asking for a room, and you need to get her approval? You can&#39;t even make that decision on your own? Cedric,you&#39;re pathetic.&#34;</p>
