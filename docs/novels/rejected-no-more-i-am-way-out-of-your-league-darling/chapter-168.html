                <p>Cedric thought back to how Lilian always teased Ryan with that playful, almost innocent charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without any trace of hesitation or shame, he fixed his cool gaze on Daniela&#39;s eyes and said the last thing she expected to hear. &#34;I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver overheard and, by accident, honked the horn several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp honking echoed through the quiet underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, throwing all caution to the wind, added with a wry smile, &#34;Now even the driver&#39;s laughing at me.How am I supposed to face people if you don&#39;t agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched him, unfazed by his supposed embarrassment, his cool demeanor still firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she finally gave in. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s set some rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face brightened, his excitement obvious. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela started, &#34;First, if you&#39;re coming along, you&#39;re just my bodyguard. Unless I&#39;m in real danger, you&#39;ll be out of sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal!&#34; Cedric agreed instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second, if I decide it&#39;s time for you to leave the house, you&#39;ll listen to me and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone grew firm. &#34;Third, no guestions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for him to respond, Daniela slid into the car. &#34;If you agree, get in. You&#39;ve got five minutes to make up your mind-&#34; Before she could finish her sentence, the door was already open, and Cedric slipped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiar scent of Cedric&#39;s cologne filled the air, replacing the cold tension between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela arrived at the Harper family&#39;s residence, she found Joyce and Katrina already waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, Katrina greeted her. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve got good news. Your father is awake. I told him you were moving back, and he insisted on being discharged. He&#39;s waitingfor you inside now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t surprised in the least. She curved her lips into a faint smile and replied, &#34;Really? The hospital must be quite something.Someone who couldn&#39;t wake up yesterday is discharged today. I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s due to the doctors&#39; skill or something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened, but Joyce, oblivious as usual, furrowed her brow.&#34;Daniela, what are you getting at? Shouldn&#39;t you be happy that Dad&#39;s awake? Or do you secretly wish something had happened to him, so you could take control of the Harper family&#39;s fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t I?&#34; Daniela asked with a faint smile. &#34;Harper Group was entirely built by my mother. This land you&#39;re standing on? It was my mother&#39;s villa, purchased with her own money. Joyce, you should be thankful I&#39;m showing any kindness at all. If not, you&#39;d have been out of here ages ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen, taken aback. In her memory, Daniela rarely spoke out, let alone argued, except for that one outburst at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?&#34; Joyce muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even bother to respond. She reached for her luggage, only to find Cedric already carrying it for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina figured Cedric was only there to drop Daniela off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela moved ahead with Cedric right behind her,while Katrina and Joyce followed, their heads bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Daniela instructed the servants to place Cedric&#39;s luggage in the guest room before heading upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh out of the hospital, Caiden was so furious at Daniela&#39;s coldness that he almost needed emergency assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short time later, Daniela descended the stairs and, with icy calm, addressed the trio seated in the living room.&#34;Why did my room become a nursery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could respond, Caiden exploded, breathless with anger. &#34;Daniela, why did you bring Cedric here to stay in the guest room? Are you trying to use him as a weapon against me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overreacting. Do I really need Cedric to handle you? He&#39;s just a friend, visiting for a few days. What&#39;s wrong with that?&#34; Without giving anyone a chance to reply, Daniela went on, &#34;Since my room has turned into a nursery, I won&#39;t take it back from the baby. Joyce, your bedroom has the best light, so I&#39;ll take that room instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Katrina sprang to her feet. &#34;Absolutely not!&#34;</p>
