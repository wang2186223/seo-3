                <p>Hamilton continued to wait, growing more impatient  by the minute. He lashed out with a kick at his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said the mole was reliable! What&#39;s going on?It&#39;s been days. why hasn&#39;t Cedric shown up yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t the scheming type, and that only added to Hamilton&#39;s anxiety. If Cedric hadn&#39;t been tempted by wealth, and the princess had lost interest,what card did he have left to play?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call Arthur now! Find out what&#39;s going on! I&#39;ve been waiting for Cedric to take the bait on this collaboration, but there&#39;s been nothing.If the offer&#39;s not tempting enough, I&#39;ll sweeten the deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was just as confused. &#34;The offer&#39;s already attractive-it can&#39;t be the issue. If you lower the terms any further, we&#39;ll be running at a loss.I&#39;ll call immediately and see what the problem is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move it!&#34; Hamilton snapped, waving his hand impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary darted off and came back in a rush. Turns out Cedric never even saw the proposal Daniela intercepted it. Arthur said she gave instructions to hold off on all collaborations with McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scowled. &#34;What the hell happened? Did Arthur mess it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary shook his head. &#34;Doesn&#39;t seem like it.Arthur said Daniela actually thought it was a solid proposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clenched his jaw. &#34;Is Daniela out of her mind?This is infuriating!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clutched his chest and bellowed in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary jumped, momentarily fearing Hamilton might be having a real medical emergency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you just standing there? Go get someone!Bring Cedric here-now!&#34; Hamilton roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary jolted back to attention. &#34;Right! I&#39;m on it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Nikolas were just arriving at the company entrance when they spotted Hamilton&#39;s secretary darting out in a panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Cedric&#39;s arm, the secretary yelled, &#34;Quick!Help! Mr. McCoy collapsed!&#34; Nikolas&#39; face filled with worry at once. Regardless of everything. Hamilton was still his father. He rushed ahead, while Cedric stayed calm and unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was at a loss. &#34;Mr. Phillips, shouldn&#39;t you come and check? Mr. McCoy has collapsed-he looks terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t see any need to get involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to refuse, Nikolas grabbed his arm in a panic. &#34;Quit arguing and come with mel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Nikolas bombarded the secretary with questions. &#34;What happened? Why did he suddenly collapse? What triggered this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary shook his head. &#34;I have no idea-I&#39;m scared stiff. Mr. McCoy&#39;s usually in great shape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold sweat broke out on Nikolas&#39; forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood off to the side, expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary couldn&#39;t help but think-being raised away from family really left its mark. Blood meant nothing if there was no bond. It was obvious in moments like this. Inside the elevator, the secretary called out, &#34;Mr.McCoy! Cedric and Nikolas are here. Are you okay?&#34; Nikolas frowned, confused. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say he passed out? Why aren&#39;t you calling for medical help? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric eyed the secretary&#39;s dramatic antics, thinking people from McCoy Group truly knew how to put on a show</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurried through the door while Cedric trailed behind at a casual pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nearly exploded. &#34;Your father fainted!Can you move faster?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who would sprint to cook for Daniela,now walked like he had all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric simply gestured toward the room &#34;Isn&#39;t someone already handling that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas carried Hamilton out and barked, &#34;Hit the elevator! Move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary blinked in surprise, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He honestly couldn&#39;t tell if this was all part of Hamilton&#39;s act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric calmly reached over and pressed the elevator button himself. The doors opened, and they stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance waited below. Nikolas hauled Hamilton inside, while Cedric pointed across the street. &#34;lf there&#39;s nothing else, I&#39;ll return to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was losing it. He slapped his leg and cried out, &#34;How can there be nothing wrong? Your father fainted! Is your heart made of stone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to answer when Nikolas cut in.&#34;Cedric, if you have time, come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at his watch. &#34;I&#39;ve got to make lunch for my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was supposed to fake unconsciousness, but he was about to lose it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he weren&#39;t worried about blowing his cover, he would&#39;ve jumped up and given Cedric a tongue-lashing right then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of heartless man was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if a frail granny collapsed in the street,surely Cedric wouldn&#39;t just stand there,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making lunch for Daniela? That was what took priority?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his life worth less than a meal for Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Hamilton felt a crushing pain  in his chest-for real this time</p>
