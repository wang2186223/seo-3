                <p>The moment those words left his mouth, Duran saw Daniela lift her head. That smile she gave him wasn&#39;t friendly-it dripped with contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened like someone had thrown a rock at it. Trying not to let it show,he met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned on her elbow and said, calm as ever, &#34;What&#39;s got you so stiff? Thinking of raising the stakes?If Damon loses, will you bark like a dog?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon leaned toward Duran and said, &#34;Don&#39;t let her mess with your head. I&#39;ve got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to face her. &#34;Let&#39;s make it official. Best of three or just one shot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t drag it out. One round settles it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave a sharp nod. &#34;Fine by me. Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, every camera in the room swiveled toward the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Hamilton went still, holding his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few heartbeats passed. Then the whole room froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face twisted. He slammed his glass down, shards scattering, and marched out without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else moved. They just stood there, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes shifted from Damon to Daniela, then dropped to the dice that lay between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some folks on the edge of the crowd still looked lost, their drinks half-raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They felt something shift. Someone should&#39;ve said who won, but no one did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then they heard Damon whisper, &#34;No way. This can&#39;t be real. How did this happen? It&#39;s just not possible!&#34; People nudged through the crowd to see for themselves. One look at the dice, and their words dried up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Damon reacted. His eyes flared as he jabbed a finger in Daniela&#39;s direction. &#34;You cheated. Admit it!&#34;That outburst snapped the room awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,people started piecing things together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye locked on Daniela, filled with doubt and something else-curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds passed before the room burst into noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She cheated. That&#39;s the only way this makes sense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real. How else could Damon lose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? And did you see how relaxed Daniela was? Like she knew she had it in the bag. She definitely pulled a trick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon spun towvard the referee. &#34;You have to check her dice! She rigged them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never took his eyes off her. Part of him expected her to swap them out when no one was looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The referee, surrounded by eyes full of suspicion, reached for the dice and turned them over in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the whole room waiting, he finally said, &#34;These dice are clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled across the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These dice must be rigged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t even know how the game works. There&#39;s no chance she won fair and square!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stepped forward,wild-eyed. He grabbed the dice and stared at them like they might confess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat gathered at his brow. &#34;There&#39;s something off about these!&#34; he whispered, half to himself. &#34;There&#39;s something off. I knowit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked up, eyes wide with a new idea. &#34;Wait! It&#39;s not what&#39;s outside. It&#39;s what&#39;s inside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped the dice harder, locking eyes with her. &#34;Tell the truth, Daniela. You messed with the inside, didn&#39;t you? Someone-bring me a hammer! I&#39;ll expose Daniela in front of everyone!&#34;</p>
