                <p>Richard couldn&#39;t hide his satisfaction. &#34;It&#39;s not a huge amount, but we can build on it over time. Alexander,Daniela&#39;s really a kind soul. I made a sincere apology earlier, and at first, she didn&#39;t respond, but when l mentioned it was my life savings, she started to soften. Daniela is nothing like that cold-hearted Joyce.Despite how you neglected her before, she never held a grudge against you. I must say, she&#39;s a gem. You&#39;re truly missing out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was overwhelmed with a mix of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing silently in the cold corridor, he whispered to himself, &#34;If I truly apologize, will she forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reflected on this, he felt a subtle warmth begin to thaw the coldness that had taken root in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it wasn&#39;t the right time yet. Perhaps he should wait just a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would wait until Bennett Group was running smoothly again and securing a significant project. Then,he could approach Daniela and ask for another chance, a fresh start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then would he feel like he could truly stand on equal ground with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he hadn&#39;t been the best husband in the past, but if he could have another opportunity, he was determined to build a better future with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To truly cherish her this time, never again exploiting her loneliness or allowing himself to take her for granted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those thoughts,Alexander felt a surge of purpose, a renewed determination to make things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce returned to Caiden&#39;s villa again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited for.a quiet moment when no one was around and trapped Cedric in the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you thought more about my proposal?&#34; Joyce asked with a sly smile, her eyes locked onto Cedric. His physique was exactly her type-thin in clothes, yet toned and muscular underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, always indifferent, fascinated her. She was eager to see just how wild and uncontrollable someone fike him could be in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. As long as the money is right, I won&#39;t spill your secret.&#34; She edged closer, her voice low and tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s lips curled into a sneer as he smoothly sidestepped her approach, causing Joyce to stumble and crash to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; she snapped, glaring up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression remained icy. &#34;You&#39;re giving yourself too much credit. Do you honestly think you&#39;re in any position to be connected with someone like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second glance, he turned and walked away, leaving her seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce slammed her fist into the ground, frustration boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had no idea what was good for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was how he wanted to play it, she&#39;d make sure to use her own methods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before rumors started circulating throughout Olisvine that Cedric had a preference for men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumors escalated, growing wilder and more exaggerated with each passing day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, attending a banquet without much concern, overheard people gossiping about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were filled with sincere regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could Cedric... What a shame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dad even told me to try harder to win his heart. After hearing that, he couldn&#39;t eat for three days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who wouldn&#39;t be disappointed? I always said I&#39;d compete with you fairly, but now, what&#39;s the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are so few decent men left in the world, and now the good ones are being snatched away from us! Is there no justice?°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once saw Dániela as a rival, but now I see I completely misjudged her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danlela held her glass of wine, listening to every word of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it made sense why the other women at the banquet had been so friendly towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t wrap her head around how these rumors had even begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Cedric, who stood not far off, mningling with a drink in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked composed and dignified, not at all like someone who&#39;d be linked to such rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you shocked too?&#34; someone murmured, leaning in to share a secret. &#34;My friend says Cedric is gay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to the speaker, her eyes wide with shock. &#34;Who told you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person shrugged nonchalantly. &#34;It&#39;s comnmon knowledge now. And word on the street is that Cedric has some pretty unusual preferences-the stranger, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the man who had been wrongly accused, Daniela couldn&#39;t help but feel a deep sense of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, &#34;I see. And what else have they been saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t usually get caught up in gossip, but seeing her curiosity, everyone eagerly spilled the latest rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Cedric goes to gay bars all the time and is pretty popular there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And apparently, he likes them rough and strong. The image is just too much to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tried to picture it, but the thought felt too taboo for her to fully entertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing his rounds of socializing, Cedric planned to seek out Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he looked, there she was, surrounded by a group of women, all chatting excitedly. Cedric found it oddly interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rarely showed interest in anything this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare to see so many people gathered around her for a conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he enjoyed seeing her so lively and at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Lilian, asking, &#34;What are they talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian chuckled lightly. &#34;They&#39;re talking about your juicy gossip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My gossip?&#34; Cedric raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded, passing on the explosive rumors she&#39;d just caught wind of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t buy into the idea that Cedric had any interest in men, so the gossip didn&#39;t really grabher attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, her focus remained on watching how Cedric and Daniela interacted with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she observed Cedric&#39;s expression carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he was the target of the rumors, Cedric didn&#39;t show a hint of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding his wine glass, he chuckled quietly, his gaze fixed on Daniela. &#34;Does she actually enjoy hearing these outrageous stories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, a strange thought began to creep into Lillian&#39;s mind.′′Aren&#39;t you angry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled. &#34;Why would I be angry about it?&#34;</p>
