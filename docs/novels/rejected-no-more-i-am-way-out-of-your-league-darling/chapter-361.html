                <p>After she finished speaking, Nina bowed her head and began to weep quietly, giving the impression that something significant had occurred between her and Cedric,who had earlier been alone with her in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression soured as she observed Nina, the situation leaving a bad taste in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina kept her gaze down, oblivious to Daniela&#39;s reaction. In a soft voice, she added,&#34;1apologize,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was about to clarify things to Daniela when she entered the room and replied,′′|sthat so? What exactly are you apologizing for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s calm question seemed to diffuse the tension Cedric had been feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina frowned. Was Daniela genuinely this undisturbed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Daniela harbored no romantic feelings for Cedric, or she trusted him implicitly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina suspected it was the former; trust was seldom granted freely in their circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a glimmer of hope, she reassured herself that if there was no romantic link between Daniela and Cedric, she might still have a chance. &#34;Look, Daniela, I accidentally spilled coffee on Cedric earlier. It was purely an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scoffed dismissively, &#34;Really? Is that it? Your expression just now suggested Cedric was at fault for something far more serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina widened her eyes, her expression filled with an adorable sense of disbelief.&#34;How could you say that?There&#39;s absolutely nothing improper between Cedric and me. Lillian, why would you entertain such unsavory ideas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian met her gaze with a mocking sneer. &#34;We&#39;re not fools here; your motives are quite transparent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she heard those words, tears that had been brimming in Nina&#39;s eyes began to spill over. &#34;Lillian, have I done something to offend you? Why must you cast such aspersions about me? Cedric is a distinguished guest at Elite Lux. I hold him in high regard. Is that objectionable? Must everyone agree with you? I didn&#39;t realize you were so overbearing, Lillian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian bristled at the accusation. &#34;Excuse me! What did you just call me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remained composed, her tone even. &#34;Overbearing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was visibly agitated, ready to confront Nina further, but Daniela intervened. Nina, misinterpreting Daniela&#39;s action as support, allowed herself a smug expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nina was about to add more, Daniela&#39;s look became stern.&#34;Are you sure you want to continue this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina hesitated, then closed her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was cold. &#34;Lillian is your supervisor here. If you&#39;re unable to show the necessary respect and can only behave courteously towards Cedric, maybe you&#39;d be better suited as a secretary at Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina cast a quick glance at Cedric. Indeed, she had ambitions to join Phillips Group, but Cedric had not yet made such an offer. She had only recently secured her position at Daniela&#39;s company, and being dismissed on her first day would be disastrous, especially in her mother&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize,&#34; Nina quickly said, her tone smooth and practiced. &#34;Lillian, I accept full responsibility. I&#39;ll reflect on my behavior.Please don&#39;t hold this against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was aware that Daniela, likely out of respect for her mother, wouldn&#39;t dismiss her hastily. Thus,her remorse was not entirely genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her plea, she turned to Daniela, attempting to charm her.&#34;Daniela, l&#39;ve apologized. Let&#39;s not dwell on this. I was really frightened when | accidentally spilled coffee on Cedric. Can we move past this, please?Your mother always forgave my mistakes; she wouldn&#39;t scold me if she were here. Daniela, you&#39;re wonderful.You won&#39;t stay upset with me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina delivered her apology with a seemingly innocent smile, her underlying motives well-hidden. Even the finance manager,pausing at the door to deliver his report, found himself momentarily moved by her act. Daniela issued a mild reproof to Nina before dismissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nina exited, she cast multiple glances back at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nina had finally left, Lillian exhaled deeply, turned to Daniela, and warned, &#34;Daniela! Nina and Elyse are far more manipulative than Katrina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a light chuckle, &#34;The Dury women are worldly; their broad experiences,connections, and influence grant them a certain stature in their social circles. They&#39;re not limited in their views like Katrina. It&#39;s best to keep your distance to avoid any potential harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was about to reply when Cedric added, &#34;I&#39;ll be on guard as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Cedric, who was visibly cautious, and smiled, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the following days, Nina kept a low profile at work. She was hardworking and adjusted well to her duties,though she occasionally showed emotional instability and her eyes involuntarily followed Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the most part,however, her conduct was impeccable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing this, Lillian suggested to Daniela, &#34;Should we see if she takes the bait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment, Daniela was busy signing documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing Lillian&#39;s suggestion, she paused and looked up, asking, &#34;The bait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian glanced towards Cedric, who was focused on his work near the office entrance. &#34;Nothing great is achieved without some risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Lillian&#39;s opinion, Daniela was always stringent with herself, and she believed Daniela should apply the same standards to others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, to draw Katrina out, Daniela had not hesitated to use herself as bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, employing Cedric as bait now seemed trivial by comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was just a strategic move. They had comprehensive protection in place to ensure Cedric&#39;s safety, eliminating any cause for concern.</p>
