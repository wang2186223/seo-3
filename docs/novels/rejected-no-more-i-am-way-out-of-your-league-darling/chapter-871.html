                <p>A dismissive laugh escaped Hamilton. &#34;Alright,consider this my one act of generosity today. Fifty million will hit your account right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s response came out in a low, indistinct mutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression turned icy, a sharp glint flickering in his eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what Daniela was truly afraid of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, a significant sum was transferred from Hamilton&#39;s private account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Hamilton instructed his secretary. &#34;Get Nikolas on the phone. Tell him I want him home today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause followed, then Hamilton added, &#34;Damon too.Make sure he comes back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, the secretary set about making the calls. But nothing unfolded as expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon responded, &#34;I&#39;m tied up with work, so I&#39;m not coming.If you want help digging up Daniela&#39;s secrets,I&#39;m out. I haven&#39;t touched a cent of the family&#39;s  money, and I plan to keep it that way Leave me out of whatever mess you&#39;re planning. Don&#39;t even tell me about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for a reply, hanging up right away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the secretary tried reaching Nikolas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t even bother answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of this only made Hamilton&#39;s mood darker. &#34;Oh,so now that they&#39;re independent, they can ignore their own father. Go to Nikolas&#39; company and tell him this-if he refuses to come back, he can forget about coming back ever again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, the secretary made his way to Nikolas &#39;workplace but wasn&#39;t even allowed past the front door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That humiliation did nothing to improve Hamilton&#39;s temper. Eventually, he cornered Nikolas at a crowded banquet, unable to contain his angger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you be so ungrateful? I&#39;m still your father Don&#39;t tell me I have to make an appointment just to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, sharp in his tailored suit, stared him down with a look that gave nothing away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sneered, &#34;All I did was take one small business from you. Was that worth all this anger?McCoy Group will be yours someday. Word is,Daniela&#39;s the one backing your company. So in the end,you&#39;re still working under someone, aren&#39;t you? I just don&#39;t get it. You used to listen without question.What changed? Never mind. I won&#39;t keep going back and forth with you today. I&#39;m still your father, so I&#39;ll let this slide. I have something I want you to take care of If you can pull it off, I&#39;ll wvelcome you back into the family.You&#39;ll take over McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile played on Nikolas&#39; lips. &#34;Me? Taking over McCoy Group? Come on, Father. Isn&#39;t Cedric the one you&#39;ve always wanted to take over? Why would you even consider me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton met his gaze, unflinching. &#34;That was true.Cedric was my first choice. But his future is set-he doesn&#39;t need this anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in Nikolas&#39; eyes. &#34;What future are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of pride slipped into Hamilton&#39;s voice.&#34;The princess of Loglil is interested in him and wants to marry him. When the king is gone, Cedric will step up He&#39;ll be king. Loglil is powerful and rich. Cedric won&#39;t care about taking over McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nikolas looked stunned. Then,laughter erupted from him-sharp and humorless. So now you remember me, Father, just because Cedric has no use for it anymore? If the princess hadn&#39;t picked him, would I still be invisible to you? I&#39;ve poured everything I have into McCoy Group all these years, and this is what I am to you? Just the backup plan? Only good enough for what Cedric turns down?Do my years of dedication mean nothing to you at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rang out, frustration bubbling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression grew icy. &#34;Enough shouting.You should be grateful. If the princess hadn&#39;t picked Cedric, you&#39;d have nothing. When you inherit McCoy Group,you&#39;ll need to listen to Cedric. He&#39;ll have more power than you ever will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; mouth twisted in resignation. &#34;In the past,I followed your orders. In the future, I&#39;ll listen to Cedric.That&#39;s what you&#39;re saying, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton struck Nikolas across the face and shouted,&#34;Do you even hear yourself? This is an opportunity most people wouldn&#39;t dare dream of, and somehow you make it sound like you&#39;re the one being wronged.Let me make this clear. McCoy Group isn&#39;t handing you anything for free. If you want it, you&#39;ll have to prove yourself by doing something for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lowered his gaze, the weight in his chest already dragging him down. &#34;To you, I&#39;ve never been more than someone who leans on others. What do you honestly think I&#39;m capable of doing for you?&#34;</p>
