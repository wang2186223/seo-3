                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want Cedric to feel uneasy over such petty things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she couldn&#39;t fully understand Cedric&#39;s emotions in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of resignation, she gazed at Cedric and let out a soft sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironically, it was Daniela&#39;s sincerity that made Cedric feel even more uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it,&#34; Cedric muttered, passing the strawberries to his secretary. He didn&#39;t have the energy to go in now. &#34;I&#39;ll head downstairs and see what&#39;s for lunch at the canteen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked away. Daniela watched him disappear down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on with him? Did his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pride take a hit? Honestly, if you&#39;re kind to him,why worry about the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol added, &#34;Mose from Lone Wolf said their leader&#39;s been tied up and won&#39;t be meeting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Alright. Also, we were meant to transfer Zahir&#39;s assets, but that hasn&#39;t been done yet,has it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol agreed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;Tell them to halt the transfer and skip the asset verification. Let it be my way of thanking them. This is resolved; I don&#39;t like being in anyone&#39;s debt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;Understood. It&#39;s interesting, really.Lone Wolf hired you to protect you before, and now they shielded Cedric. Seems like you have a solid connection with them.&#34;  Daniela nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol continued, &#34;I have a feeling you&#39;ll meet them sooner or later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose was thrilled when what Cedric had given away found its wvay back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, aren&#39;t you even a little happy?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrugged, his expression unchanged.&#34;There&#39;s nothing to be happy about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose gave a playful thumbs-up. &#34;You rich folks really don&#39;t value money, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, clearly irritated, asked, &#34;Have you found out what I asked you to investigate? Why did Nikolas suddenly show up in Olisvine for business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose replied, &#34;I&#39;m still looking into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clicked his tongue in frustration. &#34;Why is y/our intel network so sluggish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose was on the verge of tears. &#34;Boss, you know Telloc, the largest intelligence network in the world,  controls everything. Just as I was about to investigate, they wiped all the data. What am I supposed to do? Tell me,what can I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned with a frown, looking at Mose.&#34;Telloc?Nikolas is here for business. Why is he tangled up in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mose shook his head. &#34;I&#39;m not sure, but I heard Nikolas isn&#39;t here on business. It seems like he&#39;s searching for someone, though no one knows who.It&#39;s believed that Telloc is protecting this person. The McCoy family has a massive empire, and they&#39;re about to choose a new leader. The whole world&#39;s eyes are on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained indifferent, nodding slightly as he walked downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lay in the hospital bed, his voice cold as he asked his secretary, &#34;I told you to put a bounty on Cedric&#39;s head. Has anyone dared to take the job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary lowered his gaze. &#34;No.&#34; Nikolas seethed with fury. &#34;Is Daniela really that powerful? I can&#39;t believe this! Why won&#39;t anyone take it? Was the price not high enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary quickly answered, &#34;The price is astronomical, but everyone says even Ghost couldn&#39;t do it. He&#39;s among the best in the world. Others don&#39;t think they stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas drew a deep breath, his tone icy as he asked,&#34;Any word from the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary whispered, &#34;Kohen&#39;s wife is pregnant again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot a furious glare at the secretary.&#34;Pregnant again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded, &#34;Yes, your father is thrilled and has publicly granted him management rights to a casino. If it&#39;s a boy, there will be even more rewards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas closed his eyes, the pressure to claim control of the McCoy family weighing heavily on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary proposed,′′Sirit seems the family knows about Cedric&#39;s situation. They don&#39;t want to share the family assets with him7. If handling him alone is toodifficult, you could bring your brothers in.With more hands, things might go smoother. If one of them kills Cedric, it won&#39;t fall on you, and your father</p>
                
                
                
                <p>won&#39;t blame you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas thought deeply for a moment. &#34;But Daniela is a formidable opponent. If she gets angry, no number of family members will make a difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, as Cealmaur&#39;s leader, if she retaliated,it wouldn&#39;t just be them-even the family head would be in jeopardy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to take a chance, don&#39;t we? Besides,I&#39;ve noticed how indulgent your father is towards Daniela.I spoke with the family doctor, and your father&#39;s health has been declining. The successor will likely be chosen soon. You&#39;ve been planning for years.Don&#39;t throw away your advantage now and risk everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his fists, the tension rising, and immediately sent a messageto his brothers&#39; group The message read, &#34;Urgent! Come to Olisvine.Cedric is trying to take the family assets!&#34;</p>
