                <p>The finance director of Elite Lux felt as though the other party was treating him like he was foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he had double-checked with Daniela several times, and she insisted, &#34;$10.3 billion, round it up to $11 billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt like all hope was gone. It wasn&#39;t just the $11 billion; it felt as though Daniela was using money to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, are you going to sign this final statement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director of Elite Lux felt as though he was trying to please someone who didn&#39;t care, offering something that wasn&#39;t even desired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, the deal fell apart. After the meeting, Daniela reached out to Cedric, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he didn&#39;t bother answering. She found it oddly amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched the entire scene unfold with interest.She trailed Daniela into the office and asked, &#34;You mentioned yesterday you&#39;d give Alexander a chance to pursue you. Was that serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Daniela shot a glance at Lillian. &#34;Am I out of my mind? Why would I ever get involved with Alexander again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pushed further, &#34;Then what about last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s always picking on me, acting like I&#39;m a pushover!&#34; Daniela replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian laughed. &#34;So, mixing business and personal feelings doesn&#39;t bother you? Don&#39;t you like how your parents managed their relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t,&#34; Daniela said bluntly. &#34;A healthy relationship requires both people to manage it, but mixing it with business can cause a lot of complications, so it&#39;s better to steer clear. Of course, it all depends on the couple themselves.Why are you asking this all of a sudden, Lillian? Are you about to confess your feelings to Ryan?&#34; As soon as Lillian heard that, she quickly ended the call in her pocket and started coughing uncontrollably. Her face turned bright red as she exclaimed, &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, Lillian hurried out of the room, only to return moments later, warning, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare spread any rumors!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head with a grin and returned to her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexander was in a full-on panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain Daniela was finally ready to reconsider their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even planned that once she said yes, he&#39;d propose right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, all of Daniela&#39;s wealth would become his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just when he thought he had everything lined up, she dropped the bombshell that she&#39;d already completed a property notarization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse, he was now barred from taking part in any of Elite Lux&#39;s projects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could he possibly do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he walked away now, it would make him seem like he was only after her wealth, and that would be humiliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he decided to keep his cool with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it felt like she was toying with him, knowing he wouldn&#39;t dare agree, yet she still bombarded him with three messages a day asking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,he was completely at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Responding felt like a problem, but staying silent was just as tricky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself stuck in an unresolvable dilemma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Elite Lux&#39;s upcoming bidding looming,Alexander&#39;s anxiety reached a peak. His stress was so overwhelming that it caused painful mouth ulcers, making it hard for him to speak properly. &#34;Dad, what do you think we should do? Should we go for the bidding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attending the bidding would mean abandoning the commitment he had made earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if they skipped it, how could he live with missing out on a project worth billions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard balled his fists in frustration, struggling to make a hard choice. He looked at Alexander and asked, &#34;Did Daniela leave any opening for negotiation in what she said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused for a moment, then shook his head. &#34;No, she was pretty clear. She said what she needed to, then walked out, telling me to think it over on my own. She also mentioned how she admired the way her parents balanced things-her dad taking care of the home while her mom ran the business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s grip tightened even further. His gaze cut through Alexander like a sharp knife. &#34;So, she&#39;s really forcing you to choose, huh? Do you care more about the money or her?&#34;</p>
