                <p>Chaos never bothered Carol. In fact,she seemed to thrive on it-watching everything unfold like her own private show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike her, Nikolas recognized the brutal patterns of Hamilton&#39;s mind-cold control wrapped in charm,masked behind expensive suits and power plays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Daniela, he murmured, &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to compete for the cufflinks. I don&#39;t care how valuable they are-they&#39;re still just accessories.My father is not the type to let something go if it&#39;s caught his eye. He&#39;ll burn everything down to claim it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow tit of her head, Daniela gave him a soft,unreadable smile. Her gaze drifted toward the velvet display box beneath the auction lights. &#34;And what makes you so sure that I&#39;m any different?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, momentarily thrown. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela finally turned fully toward him, eyes unwavering. &#34;You&#39;re afraid of your father, aren&#39;t you?You think no one can challenge him. But tonight,you&#39;ll see it for yourself. Whoever stands across from me-him included-won&#39;t wvin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up on stage, the auctioneer was still building anticipation, listing the cufflinks&#39; origin and craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nikolas couldn&#39;t take his eyes off Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after she looked away, the impression she left lingered.Something in the way she carried herself-so unshaken, so certain-rendered him speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that single moment, Daniela became blinding. He could barely stand to look at her, yet couldn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened. A strange pressure surged through him-half awe, half something else he couldn&#39;t quite name. Words abandoned him. Daniela&#39;s presence made sure of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the final piece of the night, the cufflinks commanded a ceremonial pause before bidding opened. The auctioneer gave everyone time to admire the item up close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at the very front, Hamilton appeared entirely at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few guests gathered near his row, beaming with polite admiration. &#34;Mr. McCoy, you look so confident.Should we assume you&#39;re walking away with the cufflinks tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded with a confident smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person continued, &#34;Mr. McCoy, you&#39;re truly remarkable. Everyone knows that you collect cufflinks. No one would dare compete with you for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice interjected, &#34;We&#39;ll probably never get to lay eyes on something this rare again.&#34; &#34;Mr.McCoy, if you sold your collection of cufflinks,you could probably afford a small nation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boasting wasn&#39;t Hamilton&#39;s style. He believed dominance didn&#39;t need an introduction. Power didn&#39;t ask for attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But cufflinks were his weakness. At a time like this,he couldn&#39;t hold back and said, &#34;When it comes to cufflinks, I&#39;m hands down the best. No one else would even dare to call themselves second. These cufflinks are flawless, and no matter what it takes,they&#39;re going home with me tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his head, Hamilton locked eyes with Daniela from across the room. His voice carried a quiet menace. &#34;Anyone brave enough to challenge me,go ahead and have a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That look didn&#39;t go unnoticed. Meeting his stare with ease, Daniela turned ever so slightly in his direction.She had caught every word. Every thinly veiled threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of flinching, Daniela smiled, just enough to be seen. &#34;Is that so? Then I guess I&#39;ll be the one to test that claim tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, the auction organizers had quietly handled financial checks behind the scenes, making sure each bidder had the funds to match their ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton&#39;s turn came, the staff moved to skip him entirely, as if verification were beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a single person who questioned the financial strength of McCoy Group. They were more than capable of covering the cost of any auction item.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, right when the organizers were on the verge of skipping Hamilton&#39;s verification, Daniela stepped in and said, &#34;Why is it that Mr. McCoy doesn&#39;t have to verify his assets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air went still for a second before laughter erupted. Guests turned to each other, some covering their mouths, others howling opoenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is Daniela even saying?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s hands down the most ridiculous thing l&#39;ve heard this year!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she seriously question why Mr. McCoy doesn&#39;t have to prove his assets? Unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verify his assets? What&#39;s next, asking the sun if it plans to rise tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled throughout the hall, rising in waves.Even the auction staff exchanged bemused glances at Daniela&#39;s audacity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One organizer finally stepped forward and offered a stiff explanation. &#34;Mr. McCoy has never been asked to verify his finances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Daniela turned to Hamilton. &#34;Are we calling this special treatment? That doesn&#39;t exactly sound fair, does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still perched like royalty, Hamilton didn&#39;t bother dignifying the comment with a reply. A small flick of his fingers summoned the organizers, and his secretary rose, already prepared with documentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the whispers behind them only grew louder,fueled by mockery and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the secretary provided the documentation of Hamilton&#39;s assets, the organizers showed him even greater respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the staff walked over to Daniela, carrying themselves with an air of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her purse, she retrieved a single bank card and passed it forward with a faint smile. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the room again, followed by another round of barely-contained laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Daniela truly unfamiliar with the rules, or is she simply overflowing with confidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One bank card? Does she seriously think that&#39;s enough? Either she&#39;s clueless about the rules or she thinks her personal checking account is comparable to McCoy Group&#39;s vault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verification at this level required a comprehensive summary-assets under her name, liquidity, property,the whole deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, all Daniela handed over was a single card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member couldn&#39;t even hide his smirk. With a scoff, he took it with two fingers like it was beneath him. &#34;Alright then. Let&#39;s run this and see what you&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved toward the machine, swiped the card, and turned to glance at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, no one breathed. All eyes were fixed on the man expected to burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that reaction had never appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, the staff member stood frozen, eyes locked on the screen, comnpletely speechless.</p>
