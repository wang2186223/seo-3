                <p>Since Cedric had promised to give him three hundred million dollars, Caiden approached his meeting with Alexander more casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of arranging to meet at a cafe, they met at the Harper family&#39;s pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden wasted no time and went straight to the point, just as he had with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, how much are you willing to pay to keep it quiet that you weren&#39;t the one accompanying Daniela when she was a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Alexander off guard. He froze for a moment, clearly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated that Caiden knew about this secret. What made it worse was realizing that Caiden had likely known for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated, his silence stretching on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden smirked. &#34;Look, I know you don&#39;t have any feelings for Daniela. And honestly, you probably don&#39;t care much if I spill the truth to her. But think about it -it could still work in your favor. Daniela is now the CEO of Elite Lux. If she thinks more favorably of you,it wouldn&#39;t hurt your position, and it might even help the Bennett family, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s grin widened as he added, &#34;We&#39;re practically family now, Alexander. I&#39;m not asking for much-just five hundred thousand. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s brows furrowed as he considered the offer. After a brief pause, he nodded and replied,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made the transfer on the spot. With the transaction complete, he left without another word. Caiden watched him leave, staring at the empty space where Alexander had stood moments before.He muttered to himself, &#34;I should&#39;ve asked for more.&#34;The ease with which Alexander had agreed was infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Katrina listened intently as Caiden recounted the incident. She folded her arms and tilted her head slightly. &#34;So you&#39;re saying Alexander handed over the money without a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded, placing his glass of water back on the table. &#34;Exactly. And Cedric&#39;s three hundred million should arrive tomorrow. The bank staff already confirmed that the transfer&#39;s been initiated,but it&#39;s a huge sum, so they&#39;re double-checking it with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes lingered on the screen displaying the money Alexander had sent. Her fingers drummed lightly against the table as her mind wandered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Alexander being generous to rebuild his relationship with Daniela, or did he still harbor feelings for her? Could it be that Alexander hadn&#39;t fully moved on from Daniela while he was going to marry Joyce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina walked downstairs and spotted Joyce lounging on the couch, playing a game on her phone.Approaching her daughter, she asked, &#34;Joyce,Alexander&#39;s been staying home for a few days now.Have you two had any meaningful conversations in the evenings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce understood the implication behind her mother&#39;s question. She shook her head and replied casually, &#34;No. Alexander&#39;s been tied up with a merger deal lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out a sharp breath, her patience wearing thin. &#34;Busy or not, he still has to take breaks. You should find a way to talk to him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce frowned and pouted in response. &#34;What&#39;s there to talk about? Honestly, I didn&#39;t notice it before,but now that we&#39;re living together, it&#39;s clear how dull Alexander&#39;s life really is. All he ever does is work.I can&#39;t even hold a decent conversation with him.Honestly, chatting about e-games with Daniela is more entertaining than trying to talk to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s jaw tightened as she gasped in disbelief.She struggled to comprehend how her daughter could be so apathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think Alexander is boring? Have you even considered where your luxurious lifestyle comes from? The money for your expensive meals, designer clothes, and endless comforts doesn&#39;t just appear out of thin air. If you married someone incompetent,you&#39;d have to work for a living. Do you think you could handle the realities of working life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce set her phone down and looked up at Katrina.&#34;I have you, Mom. You&#39;ve always ensured I have a good life.Why would that ever change?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s frustration boiled over. She glanced to Alexander&#39;s room, the door firmly closed since he had returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy thought crept into her mind. Ever since Alexander had moved in, he seemed to pay little attention to Joyce. Yet, whenever Daniela was in the living room, Alexander suddenly made himself present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he here for Joyce,or was it for Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s fists clenched tightly, her nails pressing into her palms. Her eyes narrowed, dark with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would stand in the way of her daughter&#39;s happiness.</p>
