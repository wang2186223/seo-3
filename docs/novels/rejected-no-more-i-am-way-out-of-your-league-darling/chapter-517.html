                <p>As Rex was on his way out, something caught his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spotted Daniela&#39;s hair ribbon just as the elevator doors were beginning to close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Rex hastily pressed the button to reopen the elevator doors. &#34;Your wife...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she actually be the leader of Cealmaur?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This idea flickered through his mind but Rex quickly shook it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could it be possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman led Cealmaur. It was inconceivable that she would appear in Cedric&#39;s office, let alone be his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex scratched his head, entered the elevator, and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days later, Joyce visited Phillips Group to meet with Daniela about a potential collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her first visit to Cedric&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced with excitement, yet she maintaineda calm demeanor. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve brought the contract.Please sign it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;What do you mean? Are you turning down easy money? Daniela, what&#39;s holding you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t scared of anything. She simply didn&#39;t have the time recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tightened her lips and turned to Cedric. &#34;What about you? Don&#39;t miss this golden opportunity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric also showed no interest. For him, nothing was currently more crucial than their plans to have a baby. Visibly annoyed, Joyce scowled. As she walked out, she said sharply, &#34;Turning down easy money? I wonder how long you can maintain this pretense of nobility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stormed down to the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the car, she fixed a cold stare on Alexander, who occupied the passenger seat. &#34;Didn&#39;t you claim that the so-called bounty order would ensure my desires were fulfilled? I just visited them, and Cedric is unharmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander also found this puzzling. He had relied on insider information that boasted of the bounty order&#39;s flawless track record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering Cedric was merely a businessman, lacking any form of protection, his evasion was puzzling.Now, the intermediary Alexander had used was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This situation left him with a bad feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had initially planned to take out Cedric first, then get rid of Joyce, clearing his path to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, it appeared his strategy required some revisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon her return home, Daniela was met by Lillian with unexpected news. &#34;Joyce has disappeared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Lillian. &#34;Are you sure? She was in my office earlier today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian confirmed with a nod and showed Daniela a video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surveillance footage captured Joyce walking through a mall when suddenly, a battered, nondescript van pulled up alongside her. Within moments, she was pulled into the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident caused panic among the bystanders, who quickly alerted the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the police arrived, Joyce was already missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian explained, &#34;This appears to be a well-planned abduction. The van managed to evade all cameras while exiting. As of now, there&#39;s no sign of Joyce.&#34; Daniela&#39;s expression turned serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something particularly strange about this event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian continued, &#34;Fairburne Group is in chaos. There&#39;s widespread speculation about who will inherit Joyce&#39;s assets should anything happen to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Joyce hnad no children and Katrina had passed away, the only remaining relative was Caiden, still officially recorded as family with Joyce.⑤</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That indeed was a stroke of luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian smiled broadly. &#34;Daniela, given that Caiden is under psychiatric care and you&#39;re his only child,you have a legitimate claim to this wealth.&#34; Her excitement was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, did not share her excitement. &#34;If someone orchestrated this entire situation, do you really think they&#39;d simply allow Caiden or me to inherit everything without a challenge? Just wait. The person responsible will show themselves eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s insight was remarkably accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Fairburne Group convened an urgent press conference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mysterious figure, dressed in a black suit and masked, declared on camera that he would act as the interim chairman of Fairburne Group during Joyce&#39;s absence. He added that should Joyce be officially declared deceased, he would legally inherit all her assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This announcement stunned the public, who began to speculate about the masked man&#39;s identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the broadcast, Daniela focused intently on the man&#39;s eyes visible behind the large mask. They looked remarkably like Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not alone in her observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others also made the connection, comparing photos of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, rumors circulated that Cedric had inherited Joyce&#39;s vast fortune. Resourceful Individuals even uncovered video footage of Joyce at Philips Group merely an hour before she vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, # sparked widespread speculation that Cedric was, in fact, the new chairman of Falrburne Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public curiosity envisioned a dramatic love triangle and an intense battle for power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,following the press conference, the interim chairman withdrew from public view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This absence only intensified the rumors, leading people to conclude that Cedric had to step back from public appearances as he could not juggle two roles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scowled as he read the flood of congratulatory texts on his phone from business contacts. For a moment, he was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Cedric&#39;s puzzled look, Daniela chuckled lighntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and gently patted his back as if comforting a puppy. &#34;I know you&#39;re not responsible.Pl catch that person myself.&#34;</p>
