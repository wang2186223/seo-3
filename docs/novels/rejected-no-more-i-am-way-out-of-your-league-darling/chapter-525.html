                <p>After stepping out of Hackett&#39;s office, Richard didn&#39;t head straight to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he pulled out his phone and dialed Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett asked us to try and talk Daniela out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard exhaled sharply. &#34;Why is Daniela so determined to go up against them? These men are industry giants. If she pushes too far, they won&#39;t just sit back and watch. If they decide to retaliate, she won&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Alexander said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration crept into Richard&#39;s voice. &#34;Alexander, I know how hard you worked to build your success. And I know you want to be with Daniela, but is it worth risking everything you&#39;ve achieved? What if she refuses to back down and offends the wrong people?Even if you two get back together,you&#39;ll be walking into a storm that won&#39;t just pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Alexander spoke, his tone steady and unwavering. &#34;Dad, stay out of this. Daniela isn&#39;t  reckless. If she&#39;s making a move like this, she has a reason.Let me figure it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s frown deepened, but after a long pause,he let out a reluctant sigh. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he hung up, he ran a hand over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much he respected Daniela, his priority was always Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And above all, he didn&#39;t want to go back to the struggles of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>StilI, if Alexander was willing to wait, he would trust him to handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced himself to hold back from confronting Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next day, Daniela made headlines again, this time for boldly acquiring yet another major corporation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sat stiffly in front of the television, his eyes glued to the screen as Daniela&#39;s interview played.A cold unease crept through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard,don&#39;t you think your future daughter-in-law is crossing the line?&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice was low, edged with something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s stomach tightened. &#34;Well, uh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you spoken to Daniela or not? Or did you, and she just brushed you off? If she doesn&#39;t even listen to you, don&#39;t expect us to sit back and watch. The association represents over three thousand of the country&#39;s top companies; we won&#39;t let this slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard swallowed hard. &#34;What&#39;s the rush? I haven&#39;t had a chance to talk to her yet. My schedule&#39;s been packed. I&#39;ll meet with Daniela this afternoon. No, I&#39;ll go right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call and shot to his feet, panic etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was Daniela thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she seriously going up against the nation&#39;s most powerful enterprises? If they joined forces against her,she&#39;d be crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela was reviewing reports when a knock at the door interrupted her. Lillian stepped in.&#34;Daniela, Richard&#39;s here. He looks frantic and says he needs to see you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows lifted slightly. &#34;See me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded. &#34;He was completely out of breath when he arrived. His face was pale from running, and he chugged a full glass of water before he could even speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows knitted slightly. &#34;Ask him what it&#39;s about. I have an international meeting coming up. If it&#39;s nothing urgent, tell him to come back another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s meeting was with headquarters to review the latest round of financial data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overseas executives had always been skeptical of Daniela&#39;s decision to return to the country, enforcing strict accuracy checks on every report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard paced the lobby, checking the time every few seconds. When Lillian returned, he didn&#39;t wait for her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go upstairs,&#34; he said, already striding to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian held up a hand, stopping him. &#34;We can talk here.Daniela is in an international meeting. Tell me what you need, and I&#39;ll pass it along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face darkened. &#34;That won&#39;t do! This is serious, and you can&#39;t speak for her. I need to see Daniela-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave an indifferent shrug. &#34;Then come back  another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her casual response nearly made Richard lose his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked around the lobby until it landed on Cedric, who was idly trimming the branches of a potted plant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s irritation boiled over. &#34;Look at him! Just look at Cedric! He used to be the fearsome CEO of Phillips Group-calm,ruthless,always in control. And now?Now he&#39;s lounging around like some spoiled brat.Don&#39;t tell me he&#39;s riding on Daniela&#39;s coattails now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian followed his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was carefully snipping away at the plant, his expression oddly serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spoiled? Not exactly. But ever since he had married</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,he had become more approachable, even at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary had once mentioned that before Daniela entered his life, Cedric never smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,Lillian often caught Cedric grinning at Daniela,flashing a fullset of teeth, completely unguarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian, te most important thing in any relationship is sincerity!&#34; Richard&#39;s voice carried weight, his emphasis on the word unmistakable. Lillian arched a brow. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela&#39;s been making some aggressive moves lately,acquiring one company after another. Alexander and I are beside ourselves with worry-we haven&#39;t had a decent night&#39;s sleep in days. You&#39;re her right hand,aren&#39;t you? You know as well as anyone that if she thrives, so do you. So, talk some sense into her. No one takes on a giant and comes out unscathed. Just because her company is thriving now doesn&#39;t mean she should get ahead of herself. She needs to stay grounded, don&#39;t you think? Hackett spoke to me a few days ago. His message was simple: harmony benefits everyone. I think it&#39;s a sound approach. Daniela is still young; she should aim for a smooth, steady path instead of being so-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stopped short, realizing the word he was about to use might not sit well. He adjusted his tone,gentler now. &#34;What I mean is, she shouldn&#39;t back herself into a corner. Someone as sharp as Daniela wouldn&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
