                <p>Joyce shifted uncomfortably on the couch. &#34;Mom,why do you think Alexander will come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing chuckle, Katrina replied, &#34;HHe probably got rejected by Daniela. Do you really think the Bennett family hasn&#39;t considered all their options? At the end of the day, they&#39;re eyeing our fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of unease tightened in Joyce&#39;s chest. She harbored fears that Alexander might scorn her, and beyond that, she was troubled by the thought that he might not treat her child with kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Katrina reassured her the Harper family&#39;s fortune would be in her child&#39;s name and she&#39;d take care of the child herself that Joyce&#39;s tension eased slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden furrowed his brow upon hearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of taking care of a child was the furthest thing from his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no interest in a life cluttered with the chaos of diapers and nursery rhymes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he kept his feelings to himself for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing over at Joyce&#39;s belly, Caiden realized this child wasn&#39;t connected to him by blood. Was he about to endow his vast fortune on someone who wasn&#39;t even his own kin? 4</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce living in his house and using his money was one thing. He couldn&#39;t take his wealth with him beyond the grave. But the thought of leaving it all to an outsider sent a chill down his spine. The child did not share his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Caiden dwelled on this fact, the deeper his discomfort grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Joyce ever married, her allegiance would inevitably pivot to her husband&#39;s family, relegating him,her stepfather, to an ever more peripheral role in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the situation just didn&#39;t sit right with him,no matter how he pondered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trudged towards the garden, his mood somber, and called back to Katrina that he was off to pick up Richard and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, oblivious to the storm brewing in Caiden&#39;s mind, brightly reassured Joyce. &#34;See how eager your father is to embrace a grandchild someday. Don&#39;t worry, Joyce. Everything in this house belongs to you and your child-no one can claim it otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s pace faltered as he stepped outside. For an inexplicable reason, he glanced back over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, illuminated by the bright lights,Katrina&#39;s face was heavily made up, her eyes alight with pride and her smile wide with a hint of smug superiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories flooded back to Caiden unexpectedly,recalling the summer Katrina first became a part of the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come home to retrieve some documents during lunchtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw Daniela perched at the top of the stairs while Joyce,seated at the grand dining table with a bib tied neatly around her neck, declared insistently, &#34;I want egg custard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid flashed a smile and suggested, &#34;You&#39;ve had a lot of egg custard today. Perhaps you&#39;d prefer some fish instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s mood soured instantly. She ripped off her bib and began to wail loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shot the maid a fierce look and defiantly carried the whole plate of egg custards to Joyce, who devoured them with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Caiden hadn&#39;t really been paying attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a bowl of egg custard, after all. Yet now,as he reminisced about the incident, he remembered seeing Daniela, whose plate bore nothing but a few scant leaves of vegetables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During that time, Daniela had shed her baby fat at an alarming rate. But he had failed to take note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, the maid&#39;s reserved expression,Katrina&#39;s self-satisfied smirk, and Daniela&#39;s silent acceptance all seemed to underscore Daniela&#39;s unhappiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That year, Daniela was merely five years old. Yet, in the face of such inequity, she did not weep or make a fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on it, Caiden couldn&#39;t fathom why the image of Daniela&#39;s small hands clutching a plate larger than her face now struck him so profoundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A torrent of feelings overwhelmed Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the garden, the gardeners were conversing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander Bennett is on their way. Seems like he&#39;s here to propose an engagement to Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s expecting, and he still pursues her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the affluent, money can buy almost anything,can&#39;t it? Moreover, since Daniela has severed her ties with her family, all properties in this home will soon be Joyce&#39;s. The Bennett family is shrewd in their dealings.They clearly recognize the advantage in this arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my opinion, everyone&#39;s adept at making calculations-everyone except Caiden. Daniela is his flesh and blood, his own daughter. How could he possibly disown her? She&#39;s both talented and compassionate. Should he ever face adversity, she would undoubtedly come to his aid. But is it wise to depend on someone as selfish as Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! She doesn&#39;t even know who the father is.In any other family, she&#39;d be nothing but a filthy scandal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela would never find herself in such a disgraceful situation. There&#39;s a saying that a leopard doesn&#39;t change its spots, and there&#39;s some truth to it.Consider Joyce, wwho&#39;s lived in this home for years,yet remains as unrefined and impulsive as ever. Who knows where she got those traits? Anyone marrying her would surely be after her wealth.&#34; &#34;I simply can&#39;t fathom Caiden&#39;s thought process. Why is he so lavish with his fortune on outsiders? Once he passes,how will he justify his actions to his first wife?What will he say when she inquires about the severe treatment of their daughter all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truly, while men may wander, it baffles me that Caiden takes his commitment to Joyce so seriously,given she&#39;s not even his own blood. What did the late his first wife see in him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants continued their hushed discussions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden watched the servants, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually,they lauded him for his genuine kindness,even towards his adopted daughter, filling him with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet unbeknownst to him, behind his back, they considered him a gullible fool.</p>
