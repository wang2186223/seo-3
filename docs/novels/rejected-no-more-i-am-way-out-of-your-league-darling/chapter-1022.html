                <p>Hamilton was waiting eagerly for his sons and.daughters-in-law to persuade Daniela and Cedric into staying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Josh stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened at once. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh appeared drained, having endured countless nights without rest. &#34;I&#39;m here to discuss something with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hands assertively placed on his waist,Hamilton barked, &#34;Sayit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s blood boiled. If Daniela hadn&#39;t interfered,Brad would&#39;ve been gone. He wouldn&#39;t have to worry about being ambushed by Brad anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was burning with rage, while Hamilton enjoyed peace among kin. Not a chance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh forced a tight grin. &#34;I&#39;d like you to approach Daniela about handing Brad over to me. There are some misunderstandings between us that need clearing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton dismissed him with a laugh. &#34;Are you sure Burdens they&#39;re just misunderstandings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tried to eliminate Brad. Isn&#39;t that right? You call that misunderstandings? Also, why involve Daniela?She&#39;s carrying twins and should not be entangled in.your chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nearly exploded at the accusation, but Jules stepped forward and stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh, think this through. It&#39;s not wise for siblings to clash. That&#39;s not what you want, is it? We&#39;re bound by blood. Hamilton, you vowed to shield us after Dad&#39;s death. But look at us now-torn apart, and even Ethan is missing. Do you believe Dad would smile upon this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton burned with anger. &#34;You&#39;re blaming me for this? The McCoy family prospered under my watch.Even if Dad stood before us today, I&#39;d face him without shame. This family didn&#39;t fall apart under my rule. You all chose Josh as the leader. Now that everything is crumbling, blame the right one. Leave me out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh fumed, face flushing as he raised his hand toward Hamilton, ready to confront him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules blocked him again. &#34;Hamilton, what you&#39;re saying is in the past. No use rehashing it. The priority is returning the McCoy family to its pinnacle. Josh and I talked-we believe you&#39;re the best man for the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed in disbelief. &#34;Me? Fine. No problem Restore every asset you seized, and the McCoy family will rise again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules gestured toward Daniela&#39;s home. &#34;Didn&#39;t Daniela claim everything? She drained my funds, too. It wasn&#39;t a transaction-it was plunder. Hamilton, only you can fix this. Step in, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his gaze and spat, &#34;Why didn&#39;t Daniela grab funds from someone else&#39;s balance?Why just yours? Are you sure it was really your money?In my eyes, Daniela&#39;s keeping it right where it belongs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules seethed internally but kept his voice level.&#34;Alright. Let her hold the cash. Hamilton, would you consider proposing that she issue us shares in fair measure? We&#39;ll stay out of management-just like the old days when you ran operations. As long as we get our yearly support, we won&#39;t meddle. How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules presented his proposal openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression hardened as he turned toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, they looked entitled and presumptuous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s fury surged, a tight pressure forming in his chest. &#34;First, you drained me, and now you aim to drain my daughter-in-law? Next, you&#39;ll suck my grandchildren dry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh snapped. &#34;That&#39;s not fair, Hamilton! That&#39;s McCoy Group&#39;s money sitting in Daniela&#39;s account!She has to return it.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s voice thundered, drowning out their protests. &#34;When that money sat in your name, Josh,you never suggested returning it. Jules, it rested in your hands for a while, didn&#39;t it? Ever offer to give it back? I see how it is. When it&#39;s with you,it&#39;s personal.When it&#39;s with us, it suddenly belongs to everyone?Why? You think I&#39;m standing alone? You think my family is weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s bellow echoed through the villa. He stood tall, hands firm on his waist. &#34;Here&#39;s the truth!Whoever&#39;s capable can claim it. It&#39;s in Phillips Group now. Go fetch it, if you&#39;re capable. If not, get out of my sight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh and Jules had never seen Hamilton so imposing.They were stunned. Only then did they realize Hamilton had simply never shown them his wrath.They had gone too far for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules asked bitterly, &#34;So this is it, Hamilton? You&#39;re just going to let Josh and me crash and burn? Don&#39;t you feel anything when you remember Dad&#39;s wishes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton roared,&#34;Dad raised me for two decades.Iled the McCoy family for four. That debt&#39;s paid in full. If you don&#39;t treat me like blood, don&#39;t expect me to carry your burdens.&#34;</p>
