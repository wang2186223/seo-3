                <p>Later on, Nikolas discovered that when Cedric first came into money, he went through a fleeting phase where antiques became his shiny new obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela once mentioned that Cedric had even purchased an entire villa-just to stash his treasure trove of antique finds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But like a summer storm, his interest passed as quickly as it came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas figured Hamilton didn&#39;t truly understand Cedric.Otherwise, Hamilton wouldn&#39;t have dragged Cedric home to flash his riches like a parade banner.If he had, this whole display would&#39;ve seemed outright ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than throwing luxury at Cedric&#39;s feet,Hamilton would&#39;ve been better off praying to the heavens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Cedric&#39;s world spun entirely around love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton made his grand descent down the staircase, Cedric lounged on a sofa rumored to be worth more than a hundred million, casually sipping on a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow twitched. &#34;Water? For our guest?Bring out my special blend-the one that costs five million per gram,&#34; he said, sinking into the chair across from Cedric with a flourish. &#34;You&#39;ve never tasted anything like it. Try it today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that point, Nikolas was completely convinced-Hamilton was absolutely parading his wealth in front of Cedric. And Cedric had no doubts about it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised a hand, cool and calm. &#34;No need to go to the trouble. I&#39;m not really a coffee person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton clicked his tongue twice in mock dismay.&#34;You have no idea what you&#39;re passing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton then launched into a long speech,waxing lyrical about the coffee for nearly half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, it was time to eat-and Hamilton became a tour guide, describing everything from the table&#39;s origin to the wine&#39;s vintage, right down to the texture of the dessert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of consideration for Nikolas, Cedric decided not to take his leave right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meal finally wrapped up, Cedric thought he could make a quiet exit, but Hamilton had one more performance planned, his prized collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric couldn&#39;t bottle it up anymore. He let out a dry chuckle and gestured toward a striking painting at the base of the stairs. &#34;Isn&#39;t there a ten-meter version of this piece? Why settle for such a modest one here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a hearty laugh. &#34;You&#39;re clearly not in the loop. That ten-meter version? Total myth. Rumor says some mystery billionaire snagged it, but no one&#39;s ever confirmed who-because it never happened. And you know how much this little gem of  mine is worth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smug grin, he raised his fingers and flashed.a jaw-dropping number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded with an amused smile. &#34;That much,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton puffed up proudly. &#34;Naturally. Now imagine the price tag on a ten-meter version. Honestly,don&#39;t think anyone but me could ever afford something like that. So if it really existed, don&#39;t you think I&#39;d be the first to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was brimming with confidence, oblivious to Nikolas shooting him increasingly frantic eye signals like warning flares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton glanced at Nikolas. &#34;If there&#39;s something wrong with your eyes, go get them checked. What&#39;s with the weird glances?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric burst into laughter, shook his head, and made his exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t just threaten to leave-he meant it. Cedric called up a driver and was out the door before Hamilton could even lift a finger to stop him. Gone,just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton instinctively moved to run after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess hadn&#39;t even arrived yet. How could Cedric just leave like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, stop!&#34; Nikolas groaned, mortified. &#34;That ten-meter painting-the one bought by that so-called mystery buyer-it&#39;s hanging in Daniela&#39;s villa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had tried to strut his feathers, and ended up humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood rooted to the spot, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas added, &#34;Haven&#39;t you seen Damon&#39;s social media? Check it yourself. First day at the villa, he took a selfie with that exact painting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Hamilton scrambled to pull out his phone like it might save his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, there was Damon in a photo, beaming beneath the massive painting, with a bold caption,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The world&#39;s largest painting! I totally earned it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt like the punchline of a cruel joke-humiliation burning hotter than shame ever had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his secretary burst in, all excitement and no clue. &#34;Mr. McCoy! The princess has arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world swam, the light vanished, and this time,Hamilton didn&#39;t just waver-he hit the floor for real.</p>
