                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re so soft-hearted that you wouldn&#39;t let me face hardship. Right, Daniela?&#34; Elyse beamed, the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes softening. &#34;I&#39;m not asking for much, just three small requests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse raised three fingers, lowering one with each request she made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First,you will provide me with a monthly allowance of five hundred thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, overhearing, frowned in disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s face tightened with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse hesitated but then glanced at Daniela, whose calm, unreadable expression filled her with confidence.&#34;Second,you know I can&#39;t just sit around and do nothing. You should build me a lavish retirement estate,inspired by the country&#39;s grandest one, so I can earn some income while relaxing in my later years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian narrowed her eyes. &#34;Are you referring to the Sunset Retirement Home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was undoubtedly the most opulent retirement facility worldwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling it a retirement home hardly did it justice; it was more like a palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh vegetables were airlifted daily from specialized farms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seafood was brought in fresh from the deep sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every resident was attended to by at least one top-tier caregiver and a private doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was golf, horseback riding, archery, swimming, or even Go, there were expert companions available for every activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this even retirement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was essentially requesting to live in unimaginable luxury. What she was asking for was, in essence, a palace built in her honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost her mother early on and suffered under Katrina&#39;s care. Yet, in all those years,Elyse had never shown up,not even at Daniela and Alexander&#39;s wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela&#39;s role as CEO of Elite Lux was revealed that Elyse appeared out of nowhere with her two daughters, eager to reap the benefits of Daniela&#39;s success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was aware that Daniela had a plan, yet she was so infuriated by Elyse&#39;s audacity that she almost rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could anyone be this shameless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out Elyse was indeed capable of such behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked calmly, &#34;And what&#39;s the third?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse realized Daniela had already agreed to the first two demands. &#34;For the third, I&#39;d like a share of Elite Lux&#39;s stock, just like your mother kindly gave me shares in Harper Group. Your mother was always generous,and I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t disappoint me. I&#39;m not asking for much-just ten percent will suffice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t stay silent any longer. &#34;Do you have any idea how much ten percent of Elite Lux is worth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billions, at the very least! Elyse truly had the nerve to ask for such a thing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; Elyse feigned ignorance. &#34;Money isn&#39;t everything to me. But since I was close to Brylee, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be happy if I&#39;m well-off. Daniela, giving me these things would also ease your mother&#39;s mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, standing off to the side, asked coldly, &#34;Should we be thanking you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse smiled while adjusting her hair. &#34;Cedric, I know you&#39;re quite impressive, but right now, I&#39;m talking with my niece. I&#39;m asking her for something, not you. Surely you don&#39;t have a say in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was sharp-tongued, and despite her smile, her words were starting to grate on Daniela&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled, oblivious to Daniela&#39;s growing annoyance. &#34;Oops! My mistake, Daniela. Don&#39;t hold it against me. I&#39;m only looking out for you. A woman should manage her own finances after marriage.&#34; Daniela smiled back. &#34;Oh really? I thought you were handling my finances with all these plans. Cedric is precious to me, and I know how to tell the difference between those I&#39;m close to and those I&#39;m not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela finished speaking, Elyse&#39;s face stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian finally exhaled, the breath she&#39;d been holding escaping in relief after nearly being suffocated by anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, visibly irritated, realized Daniela truly knew how to drive her point home. &#34;Fine, you&#39;re right.I was mistaken. So, will you agree to these three terms, Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stared eagerly at Daniela, her eyes fixed on her red lips, unblinking.</p>
