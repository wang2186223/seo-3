                <p>The spacious villa was hauntingly silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was broken only by Caiden&#39;s frantic shout. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m your father! Have you completely lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought against the ropes, but they only tightened with every movement he made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was dressed entirely in black. She sat across from him on the sofa, her face cold and emotionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I haven&#39;t done anything lately. Why are you doing this? You know murder is a crime. You&#39;re the CEO of Elite Lux now, with power and influence. It&#39;s not worth risking jail over me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed quiet, gripping a butcher&#39;s knife, her eyes burning with a deadly intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Caiden&#39;s heart raced with panic  He gasped and shouted in a trembling voice. &#34;Cedric!I&#39;m your father-in-law. My life matters to you too. Get down here, quick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tried to head downstairs, but Ryan and Lillian blocked his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dark, Daniela smirked. The room was shrouded in darkness, with only the cool moonlight casting a ghostly, silvery glow on the floor, radiating an unsettling chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll ask the questions, and you&#39;ll answer,&#34; Daniela said coldly, standing up with the knife in hand, her piercing gaze bearing down on Caiden. &#34;I only want the truth. If you lie, don&#39;t blame me for being merciless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon was hidden by clouds, leaving Daniela in complete darkness. Her voice was cold and emotionless, like a ghost emerging from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s heart pounded with fear. &#34;What do you want to know? This has nothing to do with me! It was all Katrina&#39;s doing, not mine! If you want answers, go to Katrina and Joyce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, a defiant smile playing on her lips in the darkness. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll get to them. But right now, it&#39;s your turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s chest tightened at the ominous weight of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first question is simple. When you went after my mother all those years ago, was it your idea, or were you following someone else&#39;s orders?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s heart lurched, and he quickly responded,&#34;Of course, it was my idea. Your mother was breathtakingly beautiful back then, admired by so many men. I fell for her at first sight, and then you came along. It&#39;s that sim...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish the word &#34;simple,&#34; a cold gust of wind rushed past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the blink of an eye, Daniela was right there,standing in front of him. Just as Caiden was about to react, a sharp pain stabbed through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, staring down in a dazed confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knife was buried deep in his left thigh, blood spurting out likea fountain. Slowly, Caiden raised his head to glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he screamed in agony, &#34;Ah!&#34; The piercing scream echoed through the entire villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door of the villa swung open, and Nina stepped in, her eyes widening at the gruesome scene in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t flinch. Amidst Caiden&#39;s agonized cries,she yanked the knife from his thigh with brutal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden screamed once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked down at him, her voice calm and deliberate as she asked, &#34;Do | really need to ask again? Was it a calculated move or real affection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s lips quivered uncontrollably from the excruciating pain, and cold sweat streamed down his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his head, his eyes pleading as he glanced at Cedric standing at the top of the staircase.&#34;Cedric, help me. Daniela&#39;s lost her mind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, a second stab came down, plunging into his right thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Caiden&#39;s forehead veins throbbed as his body teetered on the edge of collapse. He almost lost consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood still, like a hunter torturing his prey,waiting patiently for Caiden&#39;s screams to subside and for him to endure the unbearable pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then pressed the sharp tip of the knife against Caiden&#39;s chest. &#34;If this knife goes any deeper,I doubt you&#39;ll hear me ask again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P&#39;l talk. I&#39;ll teIl you everything.&#34; Sweat drenched Caiden&#39;s forehead, mingling with the blood, making him appear both fierce and pitiable. &#34;I&#39;ll answer any question you ask. Before I met your mother, I was just a poor farmhand. We were worlds apart.&#34; His words rushed out, punctuated by sharp breaths from the pain. &#34;Someone gave me an invitation to a banquet and a set of fine clothes, which let me attend that event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot him a cold glance. &#34;And then, did my mother notice you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Your mother was so stunning back then. How could she even notice someone like me? I saw her,and I heard people talk about how she wNas the wealthiest person in the country, with unimaginable riches.It was just like that. I never dared to dream of her, honestly. After the banquet, I went home. Then,someone started giving me information about where she would be, what she liked, and tips on how to get her attention. &#34;Your mother was unbelievably beautiful, like a star I could never reach. Without those tips, I would never have had the nerve to dream of marrying her.&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice shook, but there was honesty in his words, his eyes lost in the memory of those days filled with beauty. The moon broke free from the clouds, spilling a silver glow across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood, half bathed in light, half swallowed by darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife gleamed in her hand, with blood dripping onto the cold floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a low voice, she asked, &#34;If that was the case, why did you win her over and then fail to cherish her?&#34;</p>
