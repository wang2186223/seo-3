                <p>Elyse&#39;s words had already stripped Nina of all hope,and now, she felt it vanish entirely, slipping away like sand through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Linden went to find Daniela, Nina was walking the same path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Linden&#39;s eyes briefly caught Nina&#39;s profile, an overwhelming sense of familiarity tugged at him,though he couldn&#39;t place why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s stomach lurched the moment her gaze met Linden&#39;s. She hurriedly rushed to the restroom,desperate to escape the sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she stepped out, Linden had already positioned himself in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s gaze lingered on Daniela, filled with a hunger he could not mask. The sight of her only stirred the flames of his wvild thoughts. Today, Daniela wore a simple black top paired with a modest skirt, yet there was nothing plain about her.Even in understated tones, she glowed her presence like a precious stone in a dull world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Linden laid eyes on Daniela, he was reminded of the very first time he saw her. Her allure always left him breathless, too entranced to form a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, I heard you specifically asked for me to stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated on a bench in the corridor outside Cedric&#39;s room, Daniela focused on the contract her secretary had handed her, not bothering to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was impressed with how you handled things.That&#39;s why I decided to keep you on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement sparked in Linden&#39;s eyes. &#34;Does this mean you&#39;re allowing me to become your private doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Natalie and Elyse appeared farther down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they overheard Linden&#39;s question,panic flashed across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a development they couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden knew the reason to Cedric&#39;s coma and their order to end his life. He had the evidence they had tried to kill Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their original plan had been to get rid of Linden once Cedric was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Daniela intended to keep Linden by her side,their carefully laid plans might unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt a wave of unease settle in her chest.Linden thought she had spent the night with him.If he stayed around, she feared his relentless pursuit and the danger it would bring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s ugly face made Nina&#39;s stomach turn, a wave of nausea hitting her instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Elyse rushed forward, her anxiety barely concealed. &#34;There&#39;s no chance Linden could ever become Daniela&#39;s personal doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk danced on Daniela&#39;s lips as she raised an eyebrow. &#34;Care to explain why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urgency in Elyse&#39;s response only revealed her desperation to stop this from happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just saying...&#34; Elyse faltered, her words failing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, tightening her fists, stepped forward with a decisive edge. &#34;His medical abilities are subpar at best. He&#39;s not even close to being qualified to be your doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, the sight of Natalie filled Linden with excitement, but her words left him momentarily dumbfounded. &#34;What do you mean, Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thought his presence by Daniela&#39;s side would work out perfectly for both him and Natalie. Why was she pushing back so hard? It didn&#39;t make sense.Unless... He glanced at Natalie&#39;s face for a moment before his eyes shifted to Daniela, glowing with her usual charm.The pieces finally clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick turn, he lowered his voice, speaking only to Natalie. &#34;Sweetheart, are you afraid I&#39;ll fall for Daniela and leave you behind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Natalie&#39;s spine as his words sank in.Her glare was sharp and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Linden only seemed more pleased with himself.In a low, almost teasing voice, he added, &#34;Relax,baby. You&#39;ll always have a special place in my heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, Nina watched the disgust painted clearly on Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer tugged at the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,her dear sister found Linden so repulsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she dismissed it all so easily before, brushing it off as nothing more than a physical matter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually think he would be a great family doctor. He&#39;s thorough and professional. Natalie, you&#39;re not a doctor. How can you claim he&#39;s not good enough for Daniela? What&#39;s really going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes shot daggers at Nina, fury igniting within her. Anger bubbled up, and for a moment, she considered lashing out at Nina with every curse she could muster. However, she forced herself to swallow the venom in front of Daniela. She took a slow breath before stretching her lips into a strained smile.&#34;What&#39;s my motive, you ask? Everything I&#39;m saying is for Daniela&#39;s benefit. Cedric stilI needs Linden&#39;s care here. How could he just leave to be her personal doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Nina mocked. Her smirk deepened as she locked eyes with Natalie. &#34;A second ago, you were saying Linden didn&#39;t have the skills. Now,suddenly, he&#39;s good enough for Cedric? Do you get to pick when his abilities measure up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension between them was palpable, and Natalie&#39;s temper flared in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, her face contorted in disapproval, snapped, &#34;Nina, stop talking nonsense. Are you trying to stir up trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina barely spared her a glance, rolling her eyes in disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse leaned towards Daniela. &#34;Daniela, we would never harm you. We know how much Cedric means to you. He needs a doctor now. You must understand that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door to the hospital room swung open with a quiet creak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shaft of sunlight spilled in from the window, casting a long shadow across the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone instinctively turned to the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there, framed in the light, stood Cedric in a sharp suit. His presence was commanding,handsome, and every inch the picture of authority.</p>
