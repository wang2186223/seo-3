                <p>In the days that passed,Alexander wracked his mind,frantic to find a way to see Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the tight security at Elite Lux headquarters made it nearly impossible for him to reach Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer, growing frustrated, asked, &#34;Are you close to Daniela or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I am!&#34; Alexander retorted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why is meeting her so difficult?&#34; The photographer, feeling defeated, sighed. They had been waiting outside Elite Lux headquarters for days in the harsh weather &#34;Why not just call her and suggest meeting at the cafe downstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander was really close with Daniela, asking her to meet at the cafe seemed rather simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll snap a few staged photos,&#34; the photographer said.&#34;I&#39;ll edit the rest. Is that acceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed his lips together, staring at the towering Elite Lux building,feeling defeated He had her number Yet he couldn&#39;t get through to her She hung up as soon as she recognized his voice How could he possibly get in touch with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting her now seemed nearly impossible, let alone sitting down for coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander was about to snap back at the photographer&#39;s criticism, Hamilton&#39;s call came through</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you even manage a few photos? I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be this useless, Alexander. I don&#39;t care how it&#39;s done,but those photos need to be in my hands today The airspace restrictions in Oiscoll are lifted today,and Daniela is sure to return. If you don&#39;t get them today,I won&#39;t need them anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s furious voice rang through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shut his eyes for a moment, then lifted his gaze toward the CEO&#39;s office at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several hours passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fire!&#34; A shout rang out, and the Elite Lux security guards quickly rushed to the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and the photographer took advantage of the moment, slipping into the building and heading towards the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer let out a sigh. &#34;No surprise she was once the world&#39;s wealthiest. The building is unbelievably opulent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was in awe of the breathtaking design</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Daniela&#39;s empire, her reign in the business world</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the Elite Lux headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the epitome of creativity and luxury, a place so grand it almost felt like a museum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was deeply moved by the sight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he not divorced Daniela, perhaps he would have a stake here now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander surveyed the space, the photographer realized the sheer dominance Daniela held in the business world</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was both awestruck and humbled by the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eagerness to meet Daniela surged, desperate for another shot at redemption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His excitement surged through him as he drew closer to the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the secretary emerged from the restroom and eyed Alexander and the photographer suspiciously. &#34;Who are you? Do you have a scheduled meeting?&#34;How did you even get up here? Security! We have unauthorized visitors! Please send help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly tried to explain, &#34;I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s husband, Alexander. Is shehere? I need to speak with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Alexander? I&#39;ve never heard of you. Our boss&#39;s husband is Cedric,not Alexander If you&#39;re going to lie, at least get your facts straight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly insisted, &#34;I was Daniela&#39;s husband,though we&#39;re divorced now. I need to speak with her.Please don&#39;t stop me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he shoved the secretary aside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stumbled, nearly losing her balance in her high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander rushed into the CEO&#39;s office, only to find it completely empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guards quickly arrived. The secretary pointed at Alexander, shouting, &#34;That&#39;s him! Take him away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was left stunned. Turning to the secretary,he asked urgently, &#34;Where is Daniela? I need to see  her!&#34; The secretary rolled her eyes, &#34;Our boss left for Oiscoll&#34; She pointed to the helicopter soaring from the balcony. &#34;She just flew out&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood frozen,dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she have left without a word?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still here, with so much left unsaid to Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even had the chance to sip a cup of coffee at the Elite Lux</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Daniela just leave like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t she told him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there another helicopter available?&#34; Alexander asked,almost frantic. &#34;Daniela must have forgotten to take me with her.Please, get me another helicopter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer closed his eyes, feeling deeply embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander wouldn&#39;t give up,pleading desperately with the secretary, &#34;I&#39;m telling the truth. I saw Daniela a few days ago. She knows I&#39;m here. We were supposed to leave together. She must have forgotten.If you don&#39;t believe me, call her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked genuinely earnest, his desperation clear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hesitated for a moment before deciding to call Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, Daniela&#39;s calm voice echoed through the line.&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
