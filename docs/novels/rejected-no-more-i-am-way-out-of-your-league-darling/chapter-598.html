                <p>Cedric had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward, he positioned himself protectively in front of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had no fear of this crowd, yet a soft, amused smile still played on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re accusing my wife of killing Marcus? Got any proof?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice was icy as he gripped Daniela&#39;s hand, his sharp gaze fixed on the people before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proof? What proof do we need?&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice rang out, loud enough to turn heads. &#34;His body was found in her place! Who else but Daniela could&#39;ve done it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a dry chuckle, his eyes filled with ridicule. &#34;Hackett, that logic is laughable. If someone drops dead on your doorstep, does that make you the murderer? By that thinking, we might as well do away with the police altogeter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, sensing the flaw in his own argument, lashed out furiously, &#34;Then who else could it be? You&#39;ve been gunning for the association, wiping us out one by one! Huey yesterday, Marcus today.You won&#39;t stop until we&#39;re completely erased!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smirked, shaking his head. &#34;That&#39;s rich. Think for a second. If we&#39;ve already beaten you in business,why would we even bother with murder? What would we gain from it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the murmuring crowd as Cedric&#39;s words sank in. Slowly, understanding flickered across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smirk deepened. &#34;Come on, we&#39;re not that foolish. Why would we kill someone and dump the body right at our doorstep? What, do you think I enjoy tanking the property value of Elite Lux and painting a target on my own back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His logic was airtight. Hackett&#39;s jaw clenched in frustration, words failing him. In his desperation, he whirled towards Alexander,who had been silently watching from the sidelines. &#34;Alexander, you&#39;re the president of the association! One of our own is dead! Are you just going to stand there fussing over your lopsided face, or are you going to say something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Alexander had already slipped his mask back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of irritation crossed his face as he replayed the earlier moment-Daniela had needed help,but Cedric had beaten him to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the weight of countless stares on him, unease crept in. His face-still not fully healed-reminded him of his imperfections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s frustration boiled over, his glare sharp as a blade. &#34;Alexander, damn it, say something! You&#39;re the president! Don&#39;t you think Marcus&#39; death has something to do with Daniela and Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander pointed the finger at Daniela, it would shift the blame, dragging Elite Lux into a storm and giving Perry Group a much-needed lifeline amid their financial struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;This situation should be left to the authorities. Until there&#39;s actual proof, I urge everyone to stay levelheaded. And personally, I trust Daniela-she&#39;s not someone who&#39;d resort to murder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face twisted with rage. Without another word, he spun around, yanked open his car door, and slammed it shut with a deafening thud before speeding off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, unfazed, kept his focus solely on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last of the onlookers had drifted away, Alexander spoke gently. &#34;I wasn&#39;t scared of Hackett. I just didn&#39;t react fast enough. Next time, I won&#39;t let anyone else step in before me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela and Cedric turned and made their way back to Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained still, his eyes fixed on Daniela&#39;s fading silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, he would shield her from everything and ensure she became the happiest woman alive. And now, he finally had the power to make it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett and his men stormed back to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Hackett&#39;s voice thundered through the hospital halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That damn Cedric can talk his way out of anything! And Alexander-what a backstabber! He&#39;s the president of the association, yet he defended Daniela? | told you before, didn&#39;t I? He likes her! Still has feelings for her!There&#39;s no way he&#39;d ever turn against her for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno fumed, frustration clear in his voice. &#34;Daniela&#39;s a nightmare to go up against. What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley narrowed his eyes at Hackett, then cast his gaze downward before asking, &#34;Hackett, where were y/ou the night Marcus died?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hit like a slap, making everyone freeze-except Huey and Farley, who both watched Hackett closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; Hackett&#39;s face twisted in confusion. &#34;I was at home! Wait a damn second! Why are you even asking?You think I had something to do with Marcus&#39; death, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett practically sprang off his seat. &#34;I was alone the whole damn night! If you don&#39;t believe me, ask my housekeeper.She never lies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett reached for his phone, ready to call home and prove his innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno placed a firm hand over Hackett&#39;s. &#34;Relax, man. It was just a joke. You know how Farley is, always messing around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sat motionless on the bed, staring at Hackett&#39;s hardened face. The memory of what had happened on the rooftop replayed in his head like a haunting reel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down his spine at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett and his men stormed out. Not long after, Huey&#39;s phone buzzed with a message from Farley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huey, after I left your place that night, Marcus called me to talk about something. I overheard him telling his driver to head to Awesmy Road-the villa district. And out of all of us, only Hackett lives there. So, logically, I think Marcus went to Hackett&#39;s place the night he died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, that wouldn&#39;t mean much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hackett outright denied it, and his reaction was way too extreme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wasn&#39;t adding up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning behind Farley&#39;s words couldn&#39;t be more obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought Hackett had murdered Marcus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey stared at the message, fear gripping his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep was out of the question. Huey was convinced Hackett had lost his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to protect himself before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t, he&#39;d be next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One name flashed in his mind-Daniela!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was anyone on this planet who could take on Hackett, it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Huey yanked out the IV and tossed the covers aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment his feet hit the cold floor, he froze. Hackett stood at the doorway, watching him. No one knew when he had arrived.</p>
