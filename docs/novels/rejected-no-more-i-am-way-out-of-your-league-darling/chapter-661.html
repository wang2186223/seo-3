                <p>The McCoy family, the aristocracy of Oiscoll, tracing back to ancient royal roots, was considered the most prestigious in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their wealth was immense, comparable to the national treasuries, embodying the essence of Oiscoll itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their current head was Hamilton McCoy, who had five sons, each renowned for their exceptional talents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was shocked. &#34;Daniela! Can you believe this?The burn mark is identical to the one I&#39;ve seen before.And this man look so much like Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained quiet for a considerable time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,she started her laptop and issued a command for further investigation to the intelligence department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood frozen, lost in thought. After a long silence, he finally asked, &#34;Daniela, I remember Cedric was an orphan, wasn&#39;t he? Good heavens! Could he really be linked to Oiscoll&#39;s aristocracy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oiscoll was known for its unique oil reserves, earning  it the title of a petroleum kingdom. Additionally, it possessed the richest mineral deposits in the world,dominating the global market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, Oiscoll had risen to become the wealthiest nation globally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within this prosperous country, the McCoy family was at the pinnacle, direct descendants of the royal line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden said, &#34;If Cedric is really Hamilton&#39;s son, he could inherit the entire McCoy family fortune and rise to become the new leader of the oil monopoly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had once been considered the wealthiest person in the world. Her wealth, however, came from aggressively developing multiple industries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family, in contrast, had their fortune handed to them, their immense wealth drawn effortlessly from their vast natural resources, placing them at the forefront of the global wealth hierarchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had stepped away from the business world for three years, and during that time, the development of Elite Lux had waned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, the McCoy family&#39;s fortunes had soared, capitalizing on their oil assets and their control of numerous ports and mineral mines,establishing themselves as the new global leaders in wealth. Caiden was astounded. He turned to Daniela and said,&#34;The McCoy family&#39;s wealth is legendary, with extravagant displays such as diamond-studded floors.Why should Cedric bother with his own business when he comes from such a prestigious family? It would be far better for him to acknowledge his heritage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him with a chilling gaze and issued a stern warning. &#34;If you let even a single word slip, I&#39;ll cut out your tongue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes grew wide. &#34;Why? Wouldn&#39;t you want to share in Cedric&#39;s luxurious life? To be part of the elite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded casually, &#34;I am already among the elite. Why would I need to marry into it? Don&#39;t tell Cedric about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded in agreement. Indeed,with the current trajectory of Elite Lux, it might well rival the McCoy family for the title of the world&#39;s wealthiest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But do you think the McCoy family is aware of Cedric&#39;s existence?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond to Caiden, though she was clearly cognizant of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family&#39;s knowledge of Cedric had been implicitly confirmed by the explosion three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still uncertain whether the McCoy family had Therefore, Cedric was Hamilton&#39;s son, his firstborn.and held the primary right to inherit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reports also indicated that Hamilton&#39;s health was deteriorating, prompting him to consider which of his children should inherit the family legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric entered the room, he noticed Daniela&#39;s and Caiden&#39;s intense stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asked, carrying breakfast.&#34;Daniela, I bought you breakfast. Come and try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden murmured to Daniela, &#34;The heir to the world&#39;s wealthiest family got up early to buy you breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a stern look. &#34;Speak out of turn again,and you&#39;re dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was so intense that Caiden visibly recoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unfazed, went to the kitchen, arranged the breakfast on a plate, and set it before Daniela.′′Try this.&#34;</p>
