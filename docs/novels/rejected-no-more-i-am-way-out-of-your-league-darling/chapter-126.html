                <p>Daniela declared with a smile, &#34;I&#39;ve made my stance clear. I don&#39;t like entangling emotions with interests.Imagine us, intertwined as lovers and yet adversaries in business, whispering endearments in solitude and clashing vehemently at work-it would just rip me apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was there, yet her eyes betrayed no trace of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an almost mocking sweetness, she glanced at Alexander. &#34;I yearn for a relationship that remains untainted.Is that too much to hope for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her question, profound and stirring, left Alexander utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood, bewildered, realizing for the first time the depth of Daniela&#39;s reservations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be that she harbored such thoughts? Nearby, Cedric was rooted to the spot, equally taken aback by the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, though hesitant, wasn&#39;t ready to let go.Everything had been aligning perfectly; how could it crumble so unexpectedly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to keep his voice steady, he questioned,11SO1what you&#39;re saying is, if I want a chance with you, I need to stay away from the project of the South and East Districts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, her smile turning cunning. &#34;Yes,and it&#39;s not limited to that. Any endeavor tied to Elite Lux is off-limits for Bennett Group. Moreover, should there be any competition between us, you must quit.After all, if you&#39;re pursuing me, competing against me for projects wouldn&#39;t be proper, would it? But let&#39;s be honest-even if you did try to compete,you wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. I prefer to state this upfront to spare youany embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned forward slightly and explained, &#34;Elite Lux has scaled back its ventures recently, focusing only on luxury goods, construction, education, tourism, aerospace, and a bit of high-tech involvement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes widened, a clear sign of his astonishment. &#34;Doesn&#39;t that complicate matters for me? So, are you saying I should just shut down Bennett Group entirely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Daniela replied, her grin brimming with cheerfulness. &#34;Didn&#39;t my parents do just that back in their day? It was quite the role reversal. Ultimately,they still had me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned distant, tinged with nostalgia.&#34;That way, a man is less likely to wander. How perfect! I&#39;ve always yearned for that kind of life. I vowed when I was little that if a man ever cooked for me, I&#39;d marry him right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart swirled with sarcasm, yet her expression remained utterly sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with a glimmer of hope as she pressed on. &#34;Do you think you can handle that,Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt a pang of despair. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t that reduce me to a man who lives off a woman? In our circles, that&#39;s just pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? A man who would go to such lengths for love is truly praiseworthy, isn&#39;t it? That&#39;s exactly the kind of devotion I&#39;m looking for!&#34; Daniela exclaimed with conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s chuckle was hollow, devoid of real amusement. &#34;You never expected this from me before.&#34; Alexander was not ready to surrender.He gazed up at the imposing structure before him. Its majesty and grandeur were undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did before,&#34; Daniela lied. &#34;It&#39;s just that we hadn&#39;t reached this point back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was taken back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went on, &#34;Moreover, I&#39;ve secured my assets with legal ties. If something were to happen to me in the future, I could leave you one percent of my assets. That&#39;s hardly insignificant; that one percent could be worth over a billion.&#34; himself at a loss for words. Legal ties? But Daniela appeared in perfect health. When would she even need such provisions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the shock on Alexander&#39;s face, Daniela&#39;s smile was tinged with irony. &#34;This is a serious discussion. Why not go home and talk it over with your father? I can wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered one last piece of advice with feigned kindness. &#34;I&#39;m tied up these days. If you agree, you won&#39;t need to attend Elite Lux&#39;s bid the day after tomorrow. Well, that&#39;s all. I&#39;m off to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela turned on her heel,leaving Alexander no chance to reply as she strode away with an air of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained, filled with suspicion that Daniela might boe messing around with him, yet he didn&#39;t have proof.</p>
