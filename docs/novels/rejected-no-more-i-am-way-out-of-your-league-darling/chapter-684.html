                <p>Daniela cast a fleeting glance at Nikolas, who had just stepped in, his face as pale as a sheet of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes remained indifferent. &#34;I thought you&#39;d already run off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pressed his lips into a thin line,resentment and frustration tangled on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a secretary arrived and called Cedric away for a discussion, leaving Daniela and Nikolas alone in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swallowed nervously,realizing how unbearable it felt to share the same room with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, deep-rooted fear clung to him, robbing him of the courage to meet her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you dislocate my arm?&#34; he asked, trying to sound cold, but the lack of strength behind his words betrayed him-a sharp contrast to the cocky man who had just come from Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unmoved, not offering so much as a flicker of emotion in reply. Feeling dejected. Nikolas muttered under his breath,&#34;So rude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slowly lifted her eyelids, and the simple action made Nikolas instinctively take a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smirk curved her lips. &#34;Relax. So long as you don&#39;t act foolishly, I won&#39;t even touch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was just about to breathe a sigh of relief when Daniela added, &#34;But if you dare feed Cedric lies again,like you did this afternoon, leaving him all alone, I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went on, &#34;I don&#39;t care about your family&#39;s petty drama. Plot all you want-it means nothing to me. But I have one rule. Don&#39;t let him get hurt. If he does, whether it&#39;s you or Hamilton McCoy, I won&#39;t spare either of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned. &#34;How could you call my father like that? He&#39;s your father-in-law!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression didn&#39;t even flinch. &#34;If Cedric accepts him as his father, sure, Hamilton&#39;s my father-in-law. If not,you two are just dust I can sweep away whenever I please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood frozen, frustration swelling inside him,yet utterly powerless. Daniela leaned back slightly, her tone razor-sharp &#34;And letting Ghost poke his nose into our business?That&#39;s hardly the move of a responsible father-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas bristled, quick to defend. &#34;My father had nothing to do with this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; Daniela arched a brow,her sneer cutting deep. &#34;Then how exactly did Ghost show up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called him myself!&#34; Nikolas shot back without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smirk deepened, dripping with mockery &#34;You? Nikolas, you have brothers, don&#39;t you? Here&#39;s some free advice-drop the dream of leading the McCoy family. With that brain of yours, you&#39;re better off watchingfrom the sidelines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas flared up. &#34;What the hell do you mean by that?Are you calling me stupid? Saying I don&#39;t measure up?Ghost follows my orders, got that? He came because I told him to! He knows I&#39;m the rightful heir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a dry chuckle. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go ahead and ask your dad? See if Ghost showed up because of your orders or his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas fumed, his jaw tightening. &#34;Fine! I&#39;ll ask him right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, he dialed a long-distance &#34;Hello.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s voice came through, impossibly neutral-giving no hint of whether he was pleased or pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I just need to confirm something. Did you send Ghost to me?&#34; Nikolas asked,shooting a smug glance at Daniela,already convinced he had the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas frowned, wondering if the call had disconnected. &#34;Hello?&#34; he asked,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Hamilton finally spoke, but his voice was eerily gentle-so unfamiliar that Nikolas stiffened. &#34;Hello, Ms. Harper. It seems my son has embarrassed himself in front of you. Or would you prefer I call you Clarinda?&#34;</p>
