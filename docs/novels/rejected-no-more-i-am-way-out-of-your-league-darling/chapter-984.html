                <p>Hamilton was still hesitating, but Brad was already transferred his money to Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, Brad murmured, &#34;Won this off Daniela,but it&#39;s right back in the pile now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added, &#34;I&#39;m tapped out. That&#39;s every penny lhad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh thrust an open palm at Hamilton. &#34;Come on, quit hesitating. I have no patience for wafflers. Don&#39;t you want your grandkids to have a bright future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, grinning, reached into Hamilton&#39;s pocket himself and passed the check across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied smirk spread over Josh&#39;s face. &#34;Good. You all can leave now. When it&#39;s time for your payout, I&#39;ll be in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers lingered only a moment before shuffling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With empty pockets, they soon found themselves standing before Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s eyes widened as she saw them. &#34;What&#39;s this?I thought you three were moving to your own places. what&#39;s with the suitcases?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew Cedric to the entryway,curiosity giving way to suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eyed their luggage, a frown creasing his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One arm raised, Cedric blocked their way. &#34;You better not be here without a decent explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had never humbled the McCoy brothers like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing full well Cedric&#39;s reputation, Brad rose onto his toes, craning for a glimpse inside. &#34;Daniela! It&#39;s me,Brad! We&#39;re here to crash at your place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela lounged on the sofa scanning through her reports, she already knew the three had sunk a hefty investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, blinking at the sight of them crowding the doorway, and flasheda teasing smile. &#34;Weren&#39;t you three headed out to strike it rich? What brings you back to my doorstep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of embarrassment crept onto Hamilton&#39;s face.His lips tightened into a silent line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad tried to lighten the mood, chuckling. &#34;We just happened to be nearby, and hunger got the best of us.Thought we&#39;d drop in for lunch.&#34; Ethan quickly chimed in, &#34;That&#39;s right! Just here for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot a skeptical glance at the luggage. &#34;You three pack suitcases every time you&#39;re hungry?Planning to turn lunch into a daily tradition here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad glanced over,hoping Daniela would step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela turned to Cedric and said, &#34;Let them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning,Brad sauntered through the door and assured her, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Daniela. We&#39;re not here to mooch off you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan bobbed his head in agreement. &#34;Yeah,absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound reassuring, Brad added, &#34;Josh promised-just one month and we&#39;ll pay everything back,interest included.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a single finger, enthusiasm sparkling in his eyes. &#34;You&#39;ll get a hefty bonus from me when it&#39;s done,I promise. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sank deeper into the cushions, making herself comfortable as she watched the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;LL throw in a bonus, too,&#34; Ethan chimed, eager to sweeten the deal. A wave of doubt crept over Hamilton. No matter how he tried, something about this investment just didn&#39;t sit right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his silence, Ethan elbowed him. &#34;Come on,Hamilton! Don&#39;t just stand there quiet. You aren&#39;t trying to weasel out, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Hamilton retorted, cheeks reddening.&#34;If we actually see a profit, every cent wvill go to Daniela. This month, though, we&#39;re flat broke, so we need a place to stay.&#34; His pride stung, knowing how pitiful he must look-an old man, investment gone south,having to rely on his own daughter-in-law for a roof. &#34;You&#39;ll get your money as soon as we have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished, all eyes turned to Daniela,silently begging for her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod from Daniela settled the matter. &#34;No problem.You&#39;ve got a month. I&#39;ll just tack the rent onto your bill later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Ethan and Brad needed to hear. Instantly,their faces lit up, both showering Daniela with thanks for her understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton alone kept glancing Daniela&#39;s way,the ease in her expression only deepening his suspicion that this investment was doomed to fail.</p>
