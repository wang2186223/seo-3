                <p>Regret tinged Daniela&#39;s voice. &#34;Oh, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander promised, &#34;Trust me, Daniela, I can return to the person I once was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;It&#39;ll take ten years, and your current face looks awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured towards Alexander&#39;s face. &#34;It&#39;s difficult for me to adjust to your appearance. Perhaps if you tell me what you like about me, I might consider changing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt deeply humiliated, but he couldn&#39;t face losing Daniela a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their previous separation was his deepest regret, and he was determined not to let her slip away again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/There&#39;s more to someone than their looks,&#34;Alexander said passionately. &#34;I&#39;ve got other qualities you&#39;ll grow to value in time. A strong partnership is built on love that goes both ways. I swear I&#39;ll love you for the rest of my life. Just give it some thought,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pondered, her chin resting thoughtfully on her hand. &#34;Sorry, probably not. I&#39;ll be honest-I care about looks, and I can&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t. Maybe think about getting some cosmetic work done first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his teeth. Of course he wanted to go through with the surgery. Yet, every plastic surgeon he consulted had told him that his face could not undergo surgery for at least five more years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was stricken with despair, and Daniela&#39;s harsh words now seemed like the final strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Alexander&#39;s eyes as he tried to keep himself together. &#34;Is appearance really all that matters to you? Can&#39;t you show me even a little compassion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was well aware that his face was irreparable,and she had raised the issue on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Alexander&#39;s eyes on her, she simply nodded in affirmation.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by emotion, Alexander&#39;s tears overflowed. &#34;This isn&#39;t right! You&#39;re being unfair,Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured angrily towards Cedric. &#34;Look at him, he&#39;s disabled, hobbling with that painful limp! He can&#39;t ever run again! Yet, you keep him by your side in the office.Why? Even with your memory gone, Daniela,how can you still favor him so much? Why?&#34; Daniela maintained her composure. &#34;He was injured while saving my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her explanation left Alexander speechless for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, observing from a distance, noticed Cedric&#39;s reaction-a mix of surprise and discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice wavered. &#34;So you don&#39;t keep Cedric close out of love, but because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Cedric, who stood quietly aside, he continued,&#34;You feel indebted to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without showing much feeling, Daniela met Alexander&#39;s eyes. &#34;This isn&#39;t your concern anymore.Are you going to leave on your own, or do I need to call security?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling defeated, Alexander turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, he said, &#34;One day, Daniela,you&#39;ll understand that no one in this world loves you more than I do. Cedric sacrificed his leg for you, but I would sacrifice my life. My love is the deepest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, Alexander exited, hs spirit crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned her attention to her paperwork,seemingly unaffected. Nikolas watched Cedric&#39;s expression, a slight smile forming on his lips. He then moved quietly to stand by Cedric&#39;s side.</p>
