                <p>The online user appeared to have a strong admiration for Daniela. They had consistently liked Daniela&#39;s posts. Every remark was left intact, without a single deletion, exuding a sense of openness and honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience was hooked, fully engrossed in the situation except for the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux. &#34;Stay focused! We need to keep throwing shade at Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The growing frustration among online users finally hit its peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, that&#39;s it! I&#39;ve been holding back, but I can&#39;t anymore. Phillips Group signs your paychecks, yet you&#39;re all too busy slandering your own boss instead of backing him up. What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is how it&#39;s going to be? Blindly trashing him now? Can Cedric and Daniela not handle their own employees? Are they seriously just letting this slide? If I were in charge, I&#39;d have fired every last one of you already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get! Before, at least there was some excuse, but now that the truth is out, you&#39;re not even acknowledging it? What&#39;s your deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m honestly done with this. I can&#39;t stand to watch anymore.Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees,you guys have officially crossed the line. How does Cedric not feel completely humiliated by all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few minutes later, a peculiar trending topic suddenly surged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling sorry for Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right behind it, yet another trend surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,your husband is being bullied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux stared at the screen, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When insults were discouraged, people seemed to enjoy attacking Cedric even more, as if it was some kind of rebellion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment they were given full freedom to bash him, they hesitated. Not only that, but now they actually pitied him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These online users were truly unpredictable-so, in response, the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux decided to turn up the heat, doubling down on their criticism. Phillips Group&#39;s PR team took it a step further, even shelling out a sizable budget to make sure Cedric stayed trending at the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees managing the platform couldn&#39;t believe what they were seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, what kind of deep-seated grudge do you all have against your CEO? This is insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group employees simply shrugged and grinned.&#34;Relax, it&#39;s all for fun! You should jump in too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moderator laughed. &#34;This whole thing is wilder than any drama series. I need to catch up on all the details!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time noon rolled around, everyone was completely drained from the relentless onslaught of online criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the conference room, a tired voice complained,&#34;I swear, I&#39;ve thrown every insult I know. I&#39;m officially out of material!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we seriously supposed to keep this up? Haven&#39;t we done enough? Even my mom called me,demanding to know why I&#39;m dragging my own boss instead of standing by him. She told me to get home immediately-I&#39;m in for a lecture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m exhausted too. My phone is practically melting at  this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, keeping an eye on the trending topics,clapped her hands cheerfully. &#34;Excellent work,everyone! Let&#39;s take a break and pick this up later.Lunch is on me-premium cuisine and top-tier barbecue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her word, elite chefs arrived, turning the Phillips Group cafeteria into a Michelin-star dining experience From high-ranking executives to security personnel,everyone indulged in gourmet meals worth thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once satisfied with their lavish feast, the team dove back into the online battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,by the afternoon, attacking Cedric became increasingly difficult as a wave of shocking revelations flooded the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackers from all corners of the web dismantled Alexander&#39;s private life, even leaking flight records of his secret trips abroad for cosmetic procedures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The criticisms from Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees were buried under a tidal wave of comments dissecting the scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 5 PM, as the workday wrapped up, the once relentless storm of negativity against Cedric had vanished without a trace. Cedric&#39;s name still dominated the trending lists,but now, it was accompanied by waves of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling sorry for Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies to Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable turn of events.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too little,too late,Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spineless commerce association! If you have an issue with Daniela,confront her! Why go after her husband instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the employees wrapped up their final wave of criticisms, an announcement was made-it was officially time to clock out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Netizens couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;Phillips Group employees are built differently. Their boss is under fire,and they&#39;re enjoying a feast. The scandal flips,and they clock out on the dot. What exactly did they even do? Cedric, are you still hiring? I&#39;d happily take a paycheck without trashing my boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second they stepped out of the office, every employee was greeted with a hefty bonus-completely unexpected but well-received.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers circulated that the luckiest employees walked away with bonuses equivalent to an entire  month&#39;s salary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office erupted into cheers. &#34;Thank you, Ms.Harper! Thank you, Mr. Phillips!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observers couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &#34;After an entire day of dragging them, isn&#39;t it a little too late to start buttering them up?&#34;</p>
