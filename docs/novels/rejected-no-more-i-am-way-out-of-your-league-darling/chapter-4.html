                <p>Divorce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,I did it! The warehouse was drenched in gasoline,packed with explosives, all set to go up in flames the second you showed up.&#34; Joyce gloated triumphantly,her voice dripping with arrogance. &#34;And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do, Daniela? NNo one&#39;s going to believe you. They&#39;ll think the footage is manipulated! Besides, I&#39;ve already wiped it clean.Dad and Alexander made it painfully clear today-they think you&#39;re useless, not worth even a shred of trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Joyce reclined on the hospital bed, a smirk playing across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep kneeling,&#34; she commanded smugly and crossed her legs. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re going to kneel before me like this forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela attempted to rise, her body straining against an invisible weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beads of sweat pooled on the floor, dampening the tiles beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart felt shattered, yet within the shards, a stubborn spark of hope flickered dimly. She had clung to the belief that Alexander, with his meticulous nature, would eventually see through the charade if he scrutinized the details more closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But reality was a cruel master. She had given Alexander too much credit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of Alexander&#39;s leather shoes echoed ominously as he approached. He towered over her,his gaze icy and unyielding. &#34;Are you ready to apologize now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain overwhelmed Daniela, her consciousness wavering. She tilted her head to meet his eyes,her voice a faint whisper. &#34;Have you considered every angle of this situation thoroughly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scornful laugh echoed above her, chilling in its disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His contempt was palpable, wrapping around her like an unrelenting frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, stop being so pathetic. Just own up to what you&#39;ve done already. Fine. Let&#39;s end this marriage. I&#39;m done wasting my life on someone as malicious as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Daniela&#39;s rigid posture crumbled.Desolation engulfed her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the last time, I&#39;m innocent.&#34;Summoning the last remnants of her strength, Daniela leaned against the wall to pull herself upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her face was gaunt, her eyes glimmered with an indomitable spirit. She fixed her gaze on Alexander,articulating each word with precision. &#34;Fine by me.I&#39;ll gladly take the divorce. Why would I want a husband too blind to see the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retreated to her shared ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs from a few patients fluttered around her.With her own phone inoperable, she borrowed one from a neighboring patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of making a call, she simply sent a text message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian, send people to Northpoint Hospital to come get me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Lillian replied, &#34;Right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s condition was deteriorating. By the time Lillian Dawson reached her, a severe fever had set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The persistent throb of her fractured rib was unrelenting, and her face was so severely swollen,it resembled an inflated balloon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian seethed with rage. &#34;Have they lost their minds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing that worthless bitch over you? Let me handle this-I&#39;ll put an end to them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she took out her phone and began to dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Daniela,despite her frailty, placed her hand over Lillian&#39;s, pressing the end call button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clenched her fists, her voice heavy with desperation. &#34;This is outright domestic abuse! You&#39;ve been hurt! Are you seriously considering forgiving Alexander after everything he&#39;s done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes then caught the glimpse of fresh blood oozing through Daniela&#39;s bandages, and tears began streaming down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Lillian&#39;s support, Daniela pushed herself to stand.&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here for now. We&#39;ll deal with them when the timne is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Daniela&#39;s weakened state, Lillian nodded,her tears mingling with a fierce resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed to tear that despicable pair apart piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian then went to take care of the hospital discharge forms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Daniela stood waiting, lifting her gaze towards the hospital&#39;s upper floors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opulent third-floor ward still glowed brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Alexander was nestled under the soft lamp&#39;s light, peeling an apple. A warm smile played on his lips as he chatted with the woman beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela managed a strained, sorrowful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten long years, and the warmth of that smile she desperately sought had never once been hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,however, had earned it effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela realized she had been wrong all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could no longer stand on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she collapsed, she saw Lillian rushing towards her,her face etched with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Daniela was hurried into the intensive care unit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The icy IV fluid seeped into her veins, lulling her into a profound slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally woke up, two days had slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! Are you alright?&#34; Lillian&#39;s eyes, swollen and red,betrayed her vigil by Daniela&#39;s side. Daniela slowly propped herself up, her voice raspy as she replied, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following breakfast, Daniela glanced at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online frenzy over &#34;the bride from the fire&#34; was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Criticism rained down on Daniela in the comments section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian exclaimed through clenched jaw, &#34;We can&#39;t just let Joyce get away with this! The internet is praising her as beautiful and kind-hearted, declaring that she deserves to be the rightful heiress to the Harper family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unfazed, her eyes skimming over the hurtful words. They no longer had the power to wound her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, she felt the fog lift, leaving her with a piercing sense of clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this moment forward, she resolved to reserve her heart for those who truly loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old Daniela had perished in the flamnes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The naive and deceived Daniela was gone, once and for all.</p>
