                <p>Returning from his business trip, Cedric was met with the infuriating news-Caiden and his wife had once again made things difficult for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered in the doorway, his expression somber and contemplative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when Daniela emerged from her office that his demeanor softened into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping towards her, Cedric asked, &#34;Might I join you for dinner tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Has your grandmother driven you out once more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, a rueful smile tugging at his lips.&#34;Indeed. She has forbidden me from returning home this evening. Since Lillian and Ryan are already under your roof,could you possibly spare a corner for me as well,just for tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dinner approached, Cedric persisted with his request. Beside them, Ryan chimed in, &#34;We&#39;ll play games in my room. We won&#39;t bother you.&#34; Daniela gave a nod of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her home was a frequent gathering spot anyway.Aside from the private floor for Daniela alone, the rest floors were filled with guest rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although each member of Elite Lux had their own residence, they all had their respective rooms in Daniela&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially,Daniela was hesitant.Cedric seemed the least likely to need her hospitality, yet there he was,seeking solace in her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware of the true motive behind his questions, though she had never openly admitted or accepted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the evening meal, Cedric made his way to her door and knocked lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an invitation, he entered and quietly took a seat in a chair, his eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from the shower, Daniela was clad in a plain white loungewear set, her hair still damp. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained seated, his demeanor grave and thoughtful. He had not bothered to change from the shirt and slacks he had worn earlier that afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His intense gaze locked onto Daniela, unwavering and deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Daniela averted her eyes, letting out a soft sigh before steeling herself to return his gaze,her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was thick with silence for a tense few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face grew even more somber as he finally spoke, his voice low and steady. &#34;Daniela, it&#39;s been a year and a half since your divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around the pen she was holding, betraying a flicker of emotion. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Things have changed a lot since then. I&#39;ve restrained myself,&#34; Cedric admitted, his voice slow but firm.&#34;Fear has gripped me-the fear of pressing too hard,the trepidation of causing offense, and the anxiety that you might feel uneasy. I was petrified of upsetting you in any way. Thus, I chose to bide my time,considering perhaps you required space to heal and to discover your true desires. I tried to make my way into your life gently, like a soft breeze you wouldn&#39;t think twice about. My only wish was to become someone important to you, without you ever catching on to how  much it meant to me. Over the last eighteen months,I&#39;ve carefully avoided overstepping. I refrained from actions or words that might seem too assertive. I&#39;ve kept myself in check, abiding by my own boundaries,waiting endlessly for the right moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a thoughtful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind the wait. Yet, it breaks my heart to watch you suffer, knowing I&#39;m stuck on the sdelines as just a friend. Daniela, I yearn to shield you. It pains me to witness anyone push you around. I want the world to recognize that you have an ally, that you are never alone. I&#39;ve made up my mind-I won&#39;t wait for fate to decide. It&#39;s clear that you and Alexander are done, so I&#39;m stepping forward now. I want to be the one who&#39;s there for you. Whether I succeed or not is irrelevant to me. From this moment on, I&#39;m claiming my place in your world. And when you&#39;re ready to open your heart,I want to be the one you choose first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric laid his heart bare, speaking with a fiery determination he rarely allowed himself to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few moments, Daniela remained silent, her eyes narrowing as she evaluated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing his forwardness might have been too much,Cedric&#39;s demeanor softened, his voice now/ carrying a hint of desperation. &#34;Look, from here on out,consider me a suitor, okay? Don&#39;t shut me out. Just give me a  shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric abruptly stood up, hoping to leave on a strong note, but in his haste, he knocked over the chair behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, he righted the chair, his cheeks coloring with embarrassment, and he hurried out of the room without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, Lillian stepped in from the balcony,having just ended a phone call. With a quick,incredulous look at Daniela, she shook her head in exasperation. &#34;Did Cedric actually just take off like that? After pouring his heart out like that, he doesn&#39;t even stick around for your response? Is he for real?Can you believe this is the same guy who pulled off that huge international deal recently?&#34;</p>
