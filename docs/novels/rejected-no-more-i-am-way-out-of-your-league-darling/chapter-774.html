            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Just then, something clicked in Daniela&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger had clouded her earlier, but now her thoughts were clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Cedric. &#34;Since when did you get so good at fighting? Why didn&#39;t I ever hear about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol paused too, her eyes snapping to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked away. &#34;Good at fighting? Me? I don&#39;t think so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed her eyes. &#34;Are you sure? You fight almost like I do, Cedric. Are you hiding something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she said that, Cedric shot a quick look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but picture a reflex from memory.Then, like a light turning on, realization struck her &#34;You move just like someone I k&lt;now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s nerves began to show. &#34;You&#39;ve got it wrong.I just got stronger recently. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s not copied from anyone.&#34; Carol listened carefully, even more confused than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at him harder, suspicion building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the servant called them in for breakfast.Carol walked off first, and Cedric followed close behind, clearly wanting to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela watched him rush toward the door, her uncertainty slowly shifted into something clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, over at the McCoy family villa, Nikolas stepped into the room and was slapped hard across the face by Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the brothers, just arriving at the door,froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew Hamilton had a temper, but no one expected him to lash out this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father!&#34; Nikolas, who always held himself like royalty and bragged about being the heir, now stood humiliated. Private lectures were one thing. But public disgrace? That was something else. &#34;Why did you hit me all ofa sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t answer right away. The secretary had just returned, whispering Daniela&#39;s words in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he didn&#39;t see her as a real threat, Hamilton couldn&#39;t help the anger bubbling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, it was all Nikolas&#39; fault. Everything Because Nikolas was nothing but a disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jabbed a finger toward the storage room. &#34;Get in there. You&#39;re staying until you figure out exactly why I&#39;m doing this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nikolas, it didn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, after being beaten down for so long,he didn&#39;t know how to push back anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his face and walked toward the storage room,burning with shame and frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other McCoy brothers stood frozen, too scared to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re all grown men!&#34; Hamilton barked. &#34;Think about it! Cedric found himnself an incredible wife. And the rest of you? Total disappointments!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept going. &#34;Do you even understand what&#39;s going on? Daniela bought the building right across from McCoy Group. She&#39;s coming after us! If any of you had even half her guts, you&#39;d be doing the same. Build something.Prove you&#39;re worth anything I could die happy then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen muttered, &#34;So what if he has a good wife? If he&#39;s just living off her, how&#39;s that impressive?&#34; Hamilton let out a dry, angry laugh. &#34;You serious? You think Cedric has nothing to show for himself? His company in Olisvine is already topping the charts in the entire country. And look at you. Standing around doing nothing! What did I do in a past life to deserve sons like this? One of these days, Daniela&#39;s going to lose every bit of respect she has for me because of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brothers said nothing. But their silence didn&#39;t mean their minds were empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal ended, Charles was the first to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen scoffed, &#34;Brownnoser. Always clinging to Daniela. Is he even part of this family? I&#39;ve had enough of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes as he watched Charles drive off. Then he turned to Kohen. &#34;If you had what it takes, you&#39;d be chasing after her too. And if you pulled it off, that&#39;d be one less mouth fighting for a piece of this family&#39;s fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen went quiet, his head low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Charles arrived at Daniela&#39;s villa. Daniela sat reading beneath the pavilion. Cedric was nearby,tending to the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stepped closer. &#34;Daniela.&#34; She looked up from her book. &#34;You again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a small smile. &#34;That move you made was something else. Buying that building across from McCoy Group must&#39;ve cost a fortune. You made it look easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It must feel nice to have that kind of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled lightly. &#34;Did you come here for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles hesitated. &#34;Are you really planning to keep Cedric out of the McCoy inheritance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm. &#34;Isn&#39;t that already clear? He doesn&#39;t need the burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles shook his head, still stunned by Cedric&#39;s luck.&#34;In that case, please help me out. If I get what I want,I&#39;ll make sure Cedric ends up with half of McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half of it.Worth more than a hundred billion.</p>
