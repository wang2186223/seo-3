                <p>That night, Hamilton barged straight into Josh&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed the things he&#39;d brought down hard on the table. &#34;Josh, you have to step in about this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s eyes flicked to the table, instantly recognizing each item.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a faint smirk, then blinked as if clueless.&#34;Hmm? What&#39;s all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face reddened as he struck the table with his palm. &#34;These are so-called gifts from our siblings -for Daniela. One&#39;s laced with poison, another&#39;s got a hidden camera. They&#39;re either spying or trying to kill!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s anger flared hotter. &#34;I&#39;ve spent my whole life holding this family together, yet some people keep targeting my grandkids. Back when Daniela was pregnant with her first kid, and someone of us tried to kill her. Dad stopped me from digging into it, andl bit my tongue. But now? Daniela&#39;s pregnant again and they can&#39;t wait to erase this child too? Josh, you lead this family now. What do you plan to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh eyed the pile again, his tone calm. &#34;So this is everything you found? Did anyone uncover more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh silently wondered if his scheme-the poisoned jasmines near Daniela&#39;s place-had slipped under the radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at him,stunned by the question.&#34;What are you implying? Isn&#39;t this bad enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh exhaled, masking his relief. &#34;Relax. I didn&#39;t mean it like that. I only think we should dig deeper to be sure nothing&#39;s missed. Besides, these bits don&#39;t look very dangerous. I&#39;ll summon our siblings and talk sense into them. You shouldn&#39;t get yourself worked up over this.&#34;  Hamilton&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;Not very dangerous?That&#39;s only because the baby isn&#39;t even a month along yet. Wait until three months-when they can learn the gender-and if they find out Daniela&#39;s carrying a boy, they&#39;ll do far worse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slammed a fist on the table. &#34;Wasn&#39;t it the same with her first pregnancy? Once they found out it was a boy, they triggered that explosion without blinking. Brutal and quick! If Daniela and Cedric weren&#39;t sharp, they&#39;d have died that day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nodded along, but deep down he thought-as long as nobody found out about the jasmines, that baby wouldn&#39;t survive three months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton went on and on, only to notice Josh drifting off into silence. &#34;Josh, are you going to deal with this or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh kept his agreeable mask on. &#34;Of course I will.Don&#39;t stress. I&#39;ll handle everything. For now, head home. I&#39;ll summon everyone soon. No need to lose sleep, Hamilton. We&#39;re family; best not to blow things up too far. It&#39;d be awkward if you fought with them, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes turned icy as he stood to leave.&#34;Josh, I came here out of respect for you. If you don&#39;t give me answers, I&#39;ll confront them myself next time.If this gets worse, don&#39;t blame me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the car pulled away, Josh turned to his secretary. &#34;I want every inch outside Daniela&#39;s villa covered with jasmines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hesitated. &#34;Given how furious Hamilton looked, you might need to handle this soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave a dismissive chuckle.&#34;Hamilton&#39;s old. He can&#39;t rein in Daniela and Cedric, so he pins his hopes on that baby. But whether it&#39;s a boy or girl, I won&#39;t let Daniela keep it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Josh finished, he dialed up his siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was sharp. &#34;You know what mess you&#39;ve made. Hamilton barged in ranting at me. All of you, come here now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hour later, Brad, Jules, and Ethan sat stiffly in Josh&#39;s living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh poured them each a cup of coffee and settled back,playing the calm big brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So. Care to explain yourselves? That baby in Daniela&#39;s belly is a McCoy by blood. What&#39;s wrong with you all? You pulled your stunts, yet Hamilton caught you so easily. Now he wants answers from me. How do you plan to fix this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh lifted the cup, sipping slowly. &#34;Honestly, I didn&#39;t plan to step in. Mason&#39;s disabled, and I&#39;m not running McCoy Group anymore. But you begged me to watch over things for now, and here comes Hamilton breathing down my neck. So I have to ask you-what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh made it clear he had no intention of defending Daniela.</p>
