                <p>Cedric shot Daniela a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Ryan and asked, &#34;Did you record what Hackett just said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan quickly nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful smile crossed Daniela&#39;s lips as she turned back to Cedric. &#34;I&#39;d like to see what his daughters look like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression soured instantly as if he&#39;d just bitten into a lemon. &#34;I&#39;d rather not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He despised those gatherings where girls drenched themselves in perfume so heavily it clashed like an overused air freshener, the chaotic mix of scents giving him an instant headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d much rather be at home cuddling with his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting a family with her was something he looked forward to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Daniela said with a playful smile at Cedric.&#34;I&#39;m curious what kind of daughters a man like him has raised.&#34; Cedric let out a reluctant sigh. &#34;Fine. But if I see anything unpleasant,you owe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as soon as they got home, Cedric wasted no time pulling Daniela upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, just when Daniela finally had the chance to sleep in, Hackett sent a message to confirm the dinner plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening, Cedric leaned in, his breath deliberately teasing Daniela&#39;s skin as he whispered, &#34;If you don&#39;t get up now, we&#39;ll miss dinner at Hackett&#39;s home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, pressing a gentle kiss against her, his voice turned playful, laced with affection. &#34;Or we could just stay home and play our own little game instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his fingers trailed up her flat stomach slowly and deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as they reached a certain point, Daniela caught his hand, stopping him in his tracks. &#34;I&#39;m getting up now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela practically bolted out of bed, rushing to the bathroom. &#34;I need to freshen up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled as he stretched out on the bed,utterly amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at the sink, Daniela lazily brushed her teeth,  feeling every bit of the exhaustion lingering in her body.Cedric had been experimenting with some new tricks lately, and she was paying the price for it,completely worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you look so drained? Was last night not satisfying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s usual stern expression melted into something softer, laced with desire, making his eyes all the more mesmerizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in this state, Cedric was undeniably captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In moments like these, Daniela recalled Lillian&#39;s words about Cedric. He was dangerously seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Cedric was the very embodiment of temptation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, his fingers tracing a slow, lazy path down her back. He leaned in, his lips brushing against her ear, his voice husky and intimate. &#34;Shall we try something new,my dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How he said those last two words sent a shiver down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swallowed hard. She was still recovering from last night. The bathroom was a disaster, and she couldn&#39;t even look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another round? There wasn&#39;t even a place leftto do  it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, Cedric had the same realization because he let out a long, dramatic sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela finally emerged from the bathroom,feeling refreshed, she found Cedric on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,the villa in the south of the city. Make the entire second floor one massive room. Have the designer send over the layout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth wide surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a villa spanning several hundred square meters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wanted to turn the entire second floor into one massive room? Had he lost his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stood stunned, Cedric turned to her with a mischievous smirk. His sirt was unbuttoned, his loose collar offering a tantalizing glimpse of his bare chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, effortlessly relaxed, radiating an irresistible allure from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela drew in a sharp breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was right all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a dangerously seductive man.</p>
