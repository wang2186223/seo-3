                <p>A little while later, Daniela sought out a different designer and requested an outfit for Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw no reason to approach Cedric&#39;s designer for this favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The designer worked exclusively for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The material used was rare, and as soon as Hamilton slipped into the outfit, he showed no interest in taking it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quality comes with a price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This led Hamilton to finally realize that Daniela&#39;s affection for Cedric ran deep, even if she never boasted about it in front of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of comfort washed over Hamilton, pleased that someone valued his son so deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of Hamilton&#39;s thoughts, Daniela was busy scheming against Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When evening arrived, Cedric served soup into Daniela&#39;s bowl. She accepted it, sipping without a word. Brad remarked, &#34;Have you heard the news? Josh is about to pour money into a huge international venture.Word is, the investment is worth billions and backed by some mysterious heavyweight. He told me someone had brought him in on the deal and even rang me up, saying it&#39;s a rare chance to rake in some cash. He wanted to know if I&#39;d come in with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As. Brad finished speaking, he waited for Daniela&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, focused on eating the fish on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fish proved trickier than usual. Daniela grew uneasy as she tried to separate the flesh from the many bones. Taking his time, Cedric picked the banes out for her, ensuring she could eat comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking somewhat defeated, Brad leaned toward Ethan. &#34;From what I gather, this could be a solid bet.You rarely get chances like these. What&#39;s your take,Ethan? Think we should put money in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying the weight of past financial mistakes, Ethan shook his head and replied, &#34;Not a chance. I&#39;ve lost enough trailing after Josh. I&#39;d rather double down with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emphasis in his voice was unmistakable. He cast a sidelong glance at Daniela, who was quietly pointing  out yet another bone on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing she wasn&#39;t going to comment, Ethan sighed and looked away. &#34;There&#39;s a buzz in Oiscoll. A lot of people want a pieceof this with Josh. He&#39;s throwing the whole company&#39;s worth into this gamble. Rumor has it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke off mid-sentence, his eyes landing on Daniela once more. &#34;Josh is talking big now. He&#39;s set on overtaking Daniela and claiming the title of the world&#39;s wealthiest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flashed in Brad&#39;s eyes as he turned to Hamilton. &#34;How about you, Hamilton? Would you consider chipping in? Josh is all in, so maybe he knows something we don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took his time before saying, &#34;I&#39;ve looked into it. The backer has money-serious money-over a hundred billion, or so I&#39;ve heard. Still, the tycoon remains a mystery, never seeking attention. The proposal itself looks good on paper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad could not help but shoot another look at Daniela,who continued sipping her soup as if none of this concerned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brad observed Daniela, his mind wandered, thìnkìng her soup might just hold more promise than any scheme to get rich. Ethan&#39;s imagination conjured visions of windfall profits.&#34;What if we threw in a small sum? Missing out on a golden chance would sting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Hamilton exchanged meaningful glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Temptation nudged Brad to speak up. &#34;Maybe we should risk a bit. After all, who turns down extra cash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shared look of agreement passed among the McCoy brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night soon crept in as the three took their leave from the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settled in front of the television, Daniela turned to Cedric.&#34;Should we give Hamilton a heads-up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s attention was elsewhere. Plans for their growing family crowded his mind as he busied himself with launching a workshop for baby gear-everything from bottles to clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between overseeing preparations and managing Daniela&#39;s routines, he barely found a free moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela got her answer from Cedric, the door to the villa opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton returned to collect a few belongings,announcing that he&#39;d be staying at his own place for several days. He wanted Daniela to have absolute peace and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he stepped out, he offered Daniela a parting smile. &#34;I&#39;m heading out to make money for my grandkids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touched, Daniela replied, &#34;You really don&#39;t have to worry.I already have enough money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurrying back into the villa, Brad quickly took Hamilton&#39;s arm and urged him along. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t fret. We&#39;re just playing with pocket change here. If it disappears, it&#39;s no worse than splurging on a getaway.Nothing to stress about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton disappeared from sight as Brad led him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded and put her mind at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spurred by Josh&#39;s encouragement, investors piled on until the total funds reached a staggering sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who put their money in buzzed with excitement and hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Jules stayed in his home, glued to the glow of his phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was waiting for the moment that would change his life. Anticipation raced through his veins, impatience making it hard to sit still.</p>
