                <p>Daniela was on her way downstairs after lunch break when the abrupt buzz of her phone halted her mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mentioned the interruption to Lillian before stepping outside to answer the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she greeted the caller with a crisp &#34;Hello,&#34; a series of footsteps resounded behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned and saw Alexander approaching,the pieces clicked intoplace instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve really outdone yourself. A whole new phone number just to reach me before the bidding? Truly impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander caught the icy edge in Daniela&#39;s eyes as she scrutinized him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the bidding meeting looming, he felt a surge of urgency. &#34;Let me explain, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s calm demeanor remained intact as she offered a small nod. &#34;Fine, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Alexander&#39;s memories, Daniela was always the sensitive young woman who felt neglected by his inattention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the woman standing before him now was a stark contrast to his memories. Clad in a sharp business suit, her hair slicked back into a neat bun,she radiated the authority of a seasoned CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was cool, detached, as she awaited his forthcoming stumble of words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, as Alexander faced her, a wave of discomfort washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, once familiar and close, now seemed like a stranger, her distance palpable and chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weren&#39;t you going to explain?&#34; Daniela pressed on,her voice tinged with casual indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity was piqued; she was eager to uncover  the kind of elaborate excuses Alexander might unveil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as anticipated, the words started flowing from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I realize my visit today might unsettle you,but I can&#39;t stand the thought of becoming just another insignificant nobody. Moreover, I believe you&#39;re not merely an echo of your father-you possess your own vision, your own strengths, your own dignity. How could you possibly be content with your future partner relegated to a mere househusband? Come on, you&#39;re underestimating me and yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words flowed with a passionate intensity, nearly swaying Daniela&#39;s initial skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her stunned expression, Alexander felt a surge of hope and continued, &#34;Daniela, I understand you. I know you better than you know yourself. You&#39;re not someone who craves power. You may appear strong and decisive now, but I know deep down, you still long to be a little girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His statement was capable of thawing the resolve of  any woman, regardless of age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, Daniela couldn&#39;t help but admire the performance. Incredible! What a display of eloquence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued, &#34;That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m here today. I&#39;m asking for a chance to stand by your side.I envision a future where, when people look at us, they won&#39;t dismiss me as unworthy. Instead, they&#39;ll see us as a perfect couple, affirming that your choice was impeccable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a definitive nod, he concluded, &#34;Trust me,Daniela. Let me take the lead on the project.promise, I&#39;ll execute it brilliantly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shone with a mixture of hope and determination, waiting eagerly for her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found his silliness almost too much to bear.Yet, since he seemed determined to underestimate her,she felt compelled to play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips twisted into a wry smile as she met Alexander&#39;s hopeful gaze and replied with a note of sorrow, &#34;Is that really what you believe? If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s clear we&#39;re not meant to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice cracked slightly as he blinked at Daniela, his expression a mix of shock and confusion. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I desire is worlds apart from what you pursue.I yearn for someone who values kindness,thoughtfulness, and puts family above the pursuit of riches. When people look at us, they shouldn&#39;t see us as the &#39;perfect couple&#39; Instead, they should be saying, &#39;Wow! She really knows how to manage him!&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned and unsure, Alexander could only stand there, struggling to process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had meticulously followed his psychology instructor&#39;s guidance, so why was it failing him now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moreover, I&#39;m already financially secure. What use do I have for someone who&#39;s just chasing more wealth? There&#39;s no charm in that.&#34; &#34;But...&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice faltered, his hands clenching at his sides. &#34;Weren&#39;t you always in love with me? How can you just change like that? Daniela,this must be some kind of joke,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small, sad nod. &#34;I did love you, but since I realized they were unrequited, I forced myself to move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s mind reeled. No! The way things were before was perfect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re saying you chose wealth over what we had?&#34; she asked, her voice laced with a mix of disbelief and sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexander opened his mouth to protest,Daniela, her face crumpling with anguish, raised her hand to stop him. &#34;No, please don&#39;t. I think I already know your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a storm of regret and despair swirled within Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he felt utterly defeated. He had failed Daniela not just once, but twice now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her walk away, her shoulders slumped and her steps heavy, Alexander was consumed with self-reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to slap himself until his face stung for being so damn clueless.</p>
