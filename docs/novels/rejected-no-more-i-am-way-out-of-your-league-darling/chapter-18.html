                <p>As Katrina and Joyce reveled in their laughter in the living room, the door burst open abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden marched in, his cheeks tinged with the redness of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing him, Katrina rose quickly from her seat.&#34;Did Daniela agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden threw up his hands in exasperation, his words cutting through the air. &#34;That ungrateful girl blocked my number!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He extended a demanding hand towards Katrina.&#34;Hand me your phone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Katrina passed her phone to him.Caiden hastily dialed Daniela&#39;s number, only to realize Katrina&#39;s number had been blocked too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden fumed, his frustration mounting. He grabbed Joyce&#39;s phone and attempted the call once more,only to face the same result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,aware that all their numbers had been blocked,kept up her facade of innocence. She approached Caiden and spoke in a soothing tone.&#34;Dad, calm down. This must be a misunderstanding Daniela might have blocked us, but she&#39;d never block you. You&#39;re her father-she wouldn&#39;t be so cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden responded with a derisive sneer. He understood Daniela&#39;s nature all too well. That ungrateful girl,much like her mother, showed little regard for family ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Caiden snatched a phone from a servant and redialed Daniela&#39;s number. This time, the call connected instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features twisted into a scowl, his simmering rage rolling off him like an ominous storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Ms. Harper&#39;s office. She&#39;s currently in a meeting and can&#39;t come to the phone. May I know who I&#39;m speaking with?&#34; a poised and professional voice responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden roared, &#34;I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s father! You tell her to give me an explanation! Blocking me, her mom, and her sister? Why would she do something like that? Is this what money does to people? Does she think she can just erase her family from her life? What, am I invisible to her now? Would she even come if I were on my last breath? What kind of father ends up with a daughter this ungrateful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the line, Lillian was not about to let anyone cast aspersions on Daniela, not even her own father. &#34;If I&#39;m not mistaken, you declared publicly just five days ago that you were disowning Ms. Harper.Following your own words, you are no longer recognized as her father. Why, then, do you expect her to answer your calls now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s complexion deepened to a furious shade of crimson, and he nearly spluttered with indignation.&#34;What the hell did you just say? Aren&#39;t I her biological father? I&#39;m the one who brought her into this world.Without my care and the sacrifices I made, she wouldn&#39;t have made it this far. Even if we&#39;ve severed ties, shouldn&#39;t she be the one to mend them? All she&#39;s ever been to me is a bitter disappointment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was left utterly speechless.How could someone like this even dare to call himself a father? He was always playing the martyr, hiding behind a mask of fake righteousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper is unavailable at the moment as she&#39;s in a meeting.Would you like me to relay a message for you?&#34; Lillian answered smoothly, her voice calm and professional, embodying poise under pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he was Daniela&#39;s father, and showing basic courtesy was the least she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice turned icy, slicing through the air with increased sharpness. &#34;You make sure Daniela calls me back within the hour. And she owns Luxor Tower,correct? I want the 18th to 20th floors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian blinked, taken aback. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act like you didn&#39;t hear me!&#34; Caiden growled,his tone sharp and impatient. &#34;The building&#39;s being renovated, isn&#39;t it? Ensure those three floors are included. I&#39;ll forward my own blueprints later, and you will adhere to those designs. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden ended the call abruptly, slamming the phone down with a triumphant expression, his smugness practically dripping off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost fifty minutes later, Daniela strode out of the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she appeared,Lillian promptly delivered Caiden&#39;s directives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father mentioned he would send someone with the blueprints for the renovation. Also,he insists you return his call within the hour.&#34;</p>
