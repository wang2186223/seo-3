                <p>Nikolas&#39; offhand comment caught Carol off guard.making her turn to stare at him in disbelreff</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration was written all over Nikolas&#39; face as he snapped back. What? Did I say anything that&#39;s not true? Everyone in Oiscoll knows Cedric just does whatever Daniela tells him! Hes got zero business sense Honestly. I&#39;d have better luck figuring this out myself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t react He simply turned around and walked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how rattled and exhausted Nikolas looked.Carol decided to step in. Wart Cednic, this is Darvela&#39;s investment we re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cednic paused and gllanced back at her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol continued. She purt up all the money for this.Hf things go sideways. she&#39;s the one taking the hit You know. she never backs a losing venture We camn&#39;t rislk Nikolas dragging her name through the maud&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas. growing more uncomfortable, interjected.&#34;Hey! What are you talking about? This business is still afloat,isn&#39;t it? Daniela doesn&#39;t lose!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot Nikolas a look. completely at a loss for words</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment. Nikolas seemed to realize her point.&#34;Alright, fine-this deal matters. Cedric, quit stalling and get Daniela down here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unfazed, took the folder from Nikolas quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas protested. Seriously, it you can&#39;t even understand the details. then-”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to lay out the basics of your project. Give me the big picture, the long-term return on investment. conversion rates, what your balance sheets look like. future market share targets, and what&#39;s most important in your current proposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met his eyes, unbothered.&#34;Why? Don&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t figured that out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hurried to cover. &#34;Of course I know all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word. Cedric settled into a chair and grabbed a sheet of paper. &#34;Great. Let&#39;s get started then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at him, completely thrown for several minutes, then finally pulled up a chair of his own. In his eyes, Cedric was just bluffing Even if he laid everything out would Cednic actually help? As if</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite any hesitation, he followed through, taking a seat opposite Cedric and carefully addressing every question as it came</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nikolas firushed explawning. Cedric had filled in the proposal&#39;s blank spaces with notes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed the pages back The framework you&#39;ve got is solid There&#39;s nothing wrong with the fundamentals Right now. you only have two main problems</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned in and eagerly looked at Cednc What problems?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up. Cednc repled. Take a look at what l wrote Study them break them down and work through the details on your own&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word he left the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at the notes Cedinc had jotted in the mangin, then asked Wart didn&#39;t you mention AmO problems? What about the second one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already halfway up the stairs. Cedric repled. &#34;Figure out what I wrote, and I&#39;l tell you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with all the secrecy? Nikolas grumbled to himself. He then sat down, grabbed a pen, and began working through the points</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Carol was in the middle of a mobile game.she glanced up during a break and noticed Nikolas surrounded by staff. everyone deep in a heated debate at the dining room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arguments continued well into the night. and by the time Carol set her phone aside. the place had emptied out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Nikolas had heavy shadows under his eyes.he looked surprisingly lively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol tilted her head and asked. &#34;Did you finally sort things out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin broke across Nikolas face &#34;I have to admit-Cedric actually knows his stuff I always thought he was just coasting off Daniela&#39;s success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol laughed quietlly &#39;He prefers to stay out of the spotlight Love&#39;s a mystery neither of us cam claim to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moming arrived,and Daniela made her way down the stairs to find Nikolas sitting rigidly on the sofa legs pressed tightly together. posture inmaculate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave her a quick nod, his eyes immediatelly darting behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw she was alone. he frowned and asked.&#34;Where&#39;s Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered. &#34;He&#39;s busy making the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas simply nodded. accepting the answer without protest. &#34;Alright</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over in the dining room. Daniela poured herself some coffee and leaned over to Carol What&#39;s up with him today? I thought he and Cedric never got along Did he wake up a new man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Carol could answer. Cedric appeared at the top of the stairs. The moment he entered. Nikolas jumped to his feat &#34;We spent all night going through your questions. Here&#39;s what I came up with.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave the plan a quick scan, offered an approving nod. and handed the papers back &#34;Looks solid to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas finally let out a breath he&#39;d been holding &#34;So.about that second problem you mentioned yesterday What is it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lifted his head locking eyes with Nikolas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anxiety crossed Nikolas&#39; face as he waited for Cedric to speak</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, Cedric said just one word.&#34;Faith.&#34; The response took Nikolas by surprise. leaving him speechless</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued, You already know how to size up a situation and keep things under contral Your judgment is spot on. All I did yesterday was point out a few details-you&#39;te already heading in the rright direction. What you&#39;ve been mussing isn&#39;t skil. but faith in yourself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat frozen in place. trying to take it all in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As sunlight streamed through the window. tears began to form in his eyew</p>
