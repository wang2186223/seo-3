                <p>The McCoy brothers stormed into Josh&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, caught up in fantasies of overnight fortune and visions of putting Daniela in her place, was jolted back to reality when the door crashed open with a thunderous bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock sent Josh tumbling right out of his chair. Spotting his brothers, he scrambled to his feet,scowling in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you guys? Have you lost your minds?&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad wasted no time, marching straight up to him. &#34;Are you telling us our investment is tanking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan jumped in, voice edged with accusation. &#34;You tricked me again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood back, fixing Josh with a cold, unforgiving stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh looked from face to face, completely bewildered. &#34;What are you talking about? That&#39;s impossible! | told you already, this is a can&#39;t-lose investment. The money&#39;s as good as in your pockets! Just give it a month,and you&#39;ll be rolling in profit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly whipped out his phone. &#34;Look at all these people lining up to invest! I keep telling them we&#39;re at capacity! You&#39;re already in on the deal, and you&#39;re still not satisfied? Seriously, do you want to make money or not? Gosh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh spoke with unwavering certainty, not a hint of doubt in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s anger eased a little as he pressed further. &#34;So where did Jules get his money, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh raised his voice, growing defensive. &#34;How should I know? I never gave him a cent. Is that why you&#39;re all barging in here? You actually think I&#39;d hand money over to Jules? Seriously, use your heads! Why would I do that? He&#39;s not my son! Hamilton, you&#39;re the clever one. Do you honestly believe I&#39;d bankroll Jules?&#34; Hamilton fell silent, unable to come up with a good response. Something about this whole exchange left him unsettled. After a pause, he turned to Josh and said, &#34;If that&#39;s how it is, then return my investment. Weren&#39;t you just bragging about a waiting list? I need cash right now. Sell my shares to someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shrugged, acting indifferent. &#34;Whatever you want. Just don&#39;t come crying to me when you see the profits rolling in. I&#39;ll send the money back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a nod. &#34;That&#39;ll work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s gaze shifted to the others. &#34;And what about the two of you? You two backing out as well? Don&#39;t come crying to me later, saying you got scammed. We&#39;re family and supposed to stick together. Yet you&#39;re all falling over yourselves to cozy up to Daniela. The closest she&#39;s got to real family here is Hamilton. One little favor from her and suddenly your loyalties go out the window. That&#39;s just naive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan glanced at each other, weighing their options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, we trust you,&#34; they said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as they walked out, there was a flicker of doubt between them. But when they saw Hamilton receive the transfer from Josh, their worries eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan turned to Hamilton and said, &#34;Honestly, I think everything&#39;s fine this time. Josh sent your money back without a hitch. This has to be the real deal. If it pays off, we could skip years of grinding. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have some extra savings for your grandkids down the line?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slipped his phone into his pocket. &#34;No thañks. I&#39;d rather put in honest work and stick to what l know. If I can&#39;t see my money, I don&#39;t trust it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan burst out laughing.&#34;YOu really are spooked by Daniela, huh? Not even tempted by a sure thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their banter echoed down the hall as they returned to their rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela sat in the living room, flipping through TV channels. She glanced up as the three men passed by, each heading off in high spirits. The following morning, Hamilton was up early. He spoke into his phone in a loud voice.&#34;Josh, you only sent part of my money yesterday. Where&#39;s the rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s booming reply came from his phone. &#34;Bank hit its daily transfer limit. I&#39;ll finish sending it in a couple of days. Don&#39;t worry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased Hamilton&#39;s brow as worry gnawed at him. &#34;You&#39;re sure nothing&#39;s going to go wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a dismissive laugh. &#34;Seriously? What could possibly happen? The amount you put in is pocket change to me. I&#39;m running with the big dogs. Don&#39;t stress.Later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton still felt a knot of anxiety twisting inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping outside, he spotted Daniela doing yoga in the courtyard. He slid open the door and called out,&#34;Daniela, can I talk to youfor a second?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes closed, Daniela balanced effortlessly in a handstand.&#34;Ask away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I did the right thing-backing out of the investment?&#34; Hamilton asked,his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did,&#34; Daniela answered, calm and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton coughed in surprise, then, without bothering to swap his slippers for shoes, rushed out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hadn&#39;t driven himself in ages, always leaving it to the chauffeur. But today, he jumped into the driver&#39;s seat, floored the gas, and sped out of the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the balcony, Brad watched the car roar off, stretching his arms with a yawn. &#34;What&#39;s gotten into Hamilton?&#34;</p>
