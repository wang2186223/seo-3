                <p>Lillian remained quiet, and a heavy silence filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Lillian eventually broke the silence, her voice low. &#34;Do you really think Cedric would be happy living like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s face remained unreadable, but inside, a storm of conflict raged, pushing her to speak her mind.	()</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening before, as Lee was leaving,he had warned her, &#34;You have to ask Daniela to divorce Cedric, or things will escalate. This is only the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notion that a man&#39;s love could eternally remain strong was a fantasy; lasting love was just a fairytale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This episode with Cedric had clearly demonstrated this. Lillian searched for a retort but came up empty.Under Lee&#39;s mysterious gaze, she reluctantly nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian saw Daniela&#39;s hands begin to tremble. She felt a pang of sorrow, yet her determination hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re a perfectionist, and so is Cedric.He&#39;s always hoped for complete honesty from you,but your resistance is only pushing him away.Why prolong the suffering? If you end things now, at least some fondness can remain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian observed the hurt flickering in Daniela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding it too difficult to continue, Lillian took out the divorce agreement she had prepared beforehand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, consider my words carefully. Cedric has been waiting downstairs all evening, and people are starting to whisper. I&#39;ll go bring him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Lillian exited, the door closing with a click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes settled on the divorce agreement, the  words stabbing at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart felt squeezed, leaving her gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s words echoed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you considered what Cedric truly desires? Are you able to provide the life he seeks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained seated, enveloped in silence, for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric burst through the door, finding Daniela at her desk in the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky outside was turning a foreboding gray, with dense clouds hanging low, signaling an imminent storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric&#39;s eyes settled on Daniela, the room&#39;s vast windows cast long shadows that seemed to surround her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill of apprehension washed over Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden, unexplainable fear clawed at him, rooting him in place and making him hesitate before stepping deeper into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if he stood on the edge of a revelation he wasn&#39;t ready to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his reluctance, he advanced into the room,his footsteps quick and his anxiety mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, Daniela would be lounging on the sofa,easily within reach for a warm embrace as soon as he entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, however, Daniela was positioned formally behind her desk, her demeanor cool and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands were neatly clasped on the surface,partially concealing a document underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands partially covered the paper, but Cedric could still make out a single word &#34;Agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling ill?&#34; Cedric asked, his concern laced with urgency. Dark circles under his eyes showed his fatigue. &#34;I have brought a team of doctors.&#34; With a mild laugh, Daniela motioned to the chair opposite her. &#34;Please,sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her request, though simple, heightened Cedric&#39;s anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He complied, sitting down and fixing his gaze on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s bothering you?&#34; he asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight shake of her head, her tone gentle. &#34;It&#39;s just a minor cold. I took some medicine last night; it&#39;s really nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cedric was not convinced. &#34;You had a doctor&#39;s visit yesterday evening. Was it because of your de...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, no,&#34; Daniela said quickly, a bit dismissively.&#34;Lillian was being overly cautious. She assumed I was having a depressive episode, which wasn&#39;t the case.A good night&#39;s rest was all I needed. See? I&#39;m perfectly fine now, aren&#39;tl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric observed Daniela carefully, his doubts lingering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then asked, &#34;You seemed rushed to meet me. What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a quick nod, but his words stalled as he opened his mouth to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s demneanor was cool, her eyes unengaging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth he intended to convey seemed to evaporate in the chill of her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a slight smile. &#34;My schedule is packed today. I have a meeting shortly and a client to host for lunch. Unless it&#39;s urgent, I should get ready.Feel free to stay or return to Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained motionless. After a tense silence, he shifted his gaze from Daniela&#39;s controlled expression to the document beneath her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught on to where his gaze had settled. She flàshed another smile, her fingers shifting ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Cedric stood abruptly.&#34;| need to get back to work. Look after yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave no reply. She kept her composed posture, lifting her eyes to meet Cedric&#39;s. Their gazes locked for a fleeting moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, suddenly, Cedric suddenly fled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched him leave, still without moving.Only when he had vanished down the hallway and the elevator doors had shut did she allow herself to sink into her chair, visibly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Cedric&#39;s secretary looked over at him,perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, weren&#39;t you supposed to clarify things?Why did you leave without saying anything? What if Daniela takes it the wrong way? If this misunderstanding escalates because you left so abruptly, what will you do?&#34;</p>
