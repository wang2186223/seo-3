                <p>Elyse sat in silence, unable to shake her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Natalie in jail, Nina was the only one left by her side. Yet, she had never seen much value in Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to her bias, Nina&#39;s upbringing lagged significantly behind Natalie&#39;s in every aspect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse exhaled slowly, her chest tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone rang. A glance at the screen revealed the lawyer&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Dury, your daughter, Natalie Dury, has requested to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she answered, &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the glass partition, Natalie wept uncontrollably. &#34;Mom! You don&#39;t know how much l&#39;ve  suffered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s throat tightened as she fouight back tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,listén to me! This is all Nina&#39;s fault! She knew l wanted that lead role, so she pushed me to the edge on purpose! And Linden must have been Daniela&#39;s pawn, sent to ruin me! You were right all along, Mom.Daniela is out for revenge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse drew in a slow breath, her shoulders heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s tear-streaked face twisted in desperation,her voice trembling. &#34;Mom! You have to make Daniela and Nina pay for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned with expectation, waiting for Elyse&#39;s reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, Elyse let out another long sigh. &#34;Natalie,you&#39;re already in prison. What&#39;s the point of fixating on this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Natalie like a slap, her body going rigid as disbelief filled her eyes. Elyse continued, &#34;I warned you before-Daniela is out of your league. But you refused to listen. If you had focused on building your career abroad, none of this would have happened. And now, after everything,you expect me to stand against her? Do you have any idea what that would mean for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone hardened as she added, &#34;Nina is the only one I have left. Thanks to your scheming, she hates me. I&#39;m already walking on thin ice with her, so don&#39;t make this any harder for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had been spoiled her entire life. Being cast aside like this sent her into a spiral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! Are you even hearing yourself? I was framed!And instead of defending me, your own daughter,you&#39;re only thinking about yourself? How could you be so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change.&#34;You&#39;re too worked up to listen to reason. No matter what I say, you won&#39;t hear it. That&#39;s enough for now. I&#39;ll visit another time.&#34; With that, she ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she rose to leave, a loud commotion erupted behind the glass. Natalie had shot up from her seat,only for the guards to shove her back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse heard it all but never turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked away, each step heavier than the last,knowing this would be the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had once been her greatest pride. But now,with cracks beyond repair, there was no reason to hold on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Elyse prepared two bowls of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One was for Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina accepted it without a glance, setting it on a nearby table. Moments later, a passing crew member accidentally knocked it over, spilling the contents onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina didn&#39;t even flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse bent down, picking up the thermos with a quiet sigh. &#34;Nina, no matter what, I&#39;m still your mother.Your father passed away when you were young, and l raised both you and your sister on my own. I know you resent me, but I swear-I&#39;ll make things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina took a slow sip of water. &#34;You don&#39;t have to,Mom. As far as I&#39;m concerned, I died the day you left me to rot in that warehouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression darkened, her features twisting with anger. She looked at Nina as if she were a stranger-one she wanted nothing to do with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you keep holding this over my head? I&#39;m your mother, whether you like it or not. I&#39;ve already admitted I was wrong. What else do you want from me? No matter what happens, you&#39;re still my daughter. You can fight it all you want, but you&#39;ll never break free. Just like Daniela, you&#39;re bound to this fate forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky overhead loomed heavy with dark clouds,casting a dull gray over everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain poured without mercy. Nina stood under the eaves, her gaze fixed on the downpour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been trapped in the night her mother died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been trapped in a childhood devoid of warmth, forever yearning for love that never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse made her way to Daniela, carrying a thermos of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Olisvine&#39;s weather is always like this,&#34; she said,offering the container. &#34;You should have something warm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile. &#34;Aunt Elyse,what an unexpected visit. You must need something from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s grip tightened around the thermos. Daniela&#39;s sharpness had always been insufferable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse forced a smile. &#34;Yes. I stopped by the film set today and had a word with Nina. But, she still resents me for favoring Natalie. I can&#39;t deny it-I neglected her in the past. And now... Daniela, once you have children of your own, you&#39;ll understand. No matter how much a mother tries, she can never meet every child&#39;s expectations. There&#39;s always one who feels slighted. That&#39;s how Nina sees it now. Of course, I know it&#39;s my fault. I don&#39;t blame her for being upset.But a mother and daughter shouldn&#39;t let resentment fester. Once that happens, there&#39;s no turning back.Don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied her, amusement flickering in her eyes. A small, knowing smile curved her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, pleased with the reaction, softened her tone.&#34;Your mother was fortunate to have a daughter like you. What you&#39;ve accomplished-building an empire like this-she never could have imagined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent. She knew Elyse was working her way up to a request.</p>
