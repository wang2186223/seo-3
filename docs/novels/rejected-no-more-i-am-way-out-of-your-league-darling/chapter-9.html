                <p>The comments online had grown so rampant that Caiden found himself unable to face the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People accused him of favoring his stepdaughter.Some questioned whether he derived some twisted pleasure from parenting another man&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each biting comment sliced through Caiden&#39;s pride like a sharp blade. Some of them branded him a brazen social climber,suggesting he had ascended the societal ranks on the coattails of Daniela&#39;s deceased mother.Following her passing, he let her daughter bullied by his stepdaughter.  Critics mocked his so-called fragile masculinity,claiming he resorted to such demeaning tactics merely to uphold it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,seething with fury, shattered several cups at home and bellowed at Alexander, &#34;Tell Daniela if she&#39;s not home by the end of the day, she&#39;s out of the family for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded, &#34;I divorced Daniela today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The room seemed to tilt around Caiden.&#34;Daniela divorced you? How dare she!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander maintained his composure. Our divorce is all over the internet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staggered, Caiden clutched at his chest, his breath hitching as his legs folded beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Alexander&#39;s arrival at the hospital, Katrina&#39;s loud sobs echoed down the hallway before he even stepped into the room.  As he entered, he noticed the pronounced veins throbbing on Caiden&#39;s forehead, a testament to his simmering rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Caiden&#39;s eyes locked on Alexander, he lamented, &#34;You have endured much. It is our disgrace that we raised such a ungrateful girl.Joyce has cleared up everything with us. The audio clip and footage are fabricated. She didn&#39;t say those things!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears streaming down her face, Katrina added,&#34;Absolutely, they&#39;re nothing but lies! Alexander, don&#39;t fret over the divorce with Daniela. You and Joyce have grown up together. You two are a perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned to Caiden, seeking confirmation.&#34;Isn&#39;t that right, dear?&#34; Caiden nodded vigorously, his face a mask of firm agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity of his defense made it seem to any observer as though Joyce was his own flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, it&#39;s well known that a marriage alliance exists between the Harper and Bennett families. Alexander,you could marry Joyce instead. That way, we&#39;d still unite our families as intended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded again, more eagerly this time. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m going to make a public declaration immediately,cutting ties with Daniela. From this moment forward,Joyceis my only daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, Joyce burst into tears and rushed into Caiden&#39;s embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between heavy sobs, she declared, &#34;Dad, I will be a good daughter to you. I&#39;ll take care of you when you&#39;re old!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina dabbed at her eyes with a tissue in a theatrical display of emotion, and remarked to Alexander, &#34;Look at the touching bond between father and daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed quiet throughout this exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wiped away her feigned tears and turned to Alexander with a coy smile. &#34;Alexander, when do you  think we should get married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression remained unreadable as he spoke in a flat tone. &#34;I&#39;ll need to take this up with my family first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile briefly wavered, revealing a flicker of disappointment before she recomposed herself,donning her charming mask once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft, reassuring smile, she murmured,&#34;Alexander, I&#39;ll do anything you ask-I&#39;m here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Alexander stepped out of the hospital room,Joyce hurried after him, her posture meek, radiating a timid and vulnerable charm. Her eyes, reddened from emotion, conveyed a blend of sorrow and distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, is it because I&#39;m not my father&#39;s biological daughter that you hold back? Is that the real reason you won&#39;t marry me? Do you scorn me like the rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her gestures and tone, Joyce mirrored Katrina,possessing an aura that seemed out of place among refined circles. Her eyebrows arched slightly in a manner that seemed contrived, her voice overly saccharine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander studied her face in contemplative silence for a long moment before he finally responded, &#34;The audio and surveillance footage weren&#39;t tampered with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve had experts verify their authenticity.&#34;1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze in place. She had not anticipated that Alexander would delve into the investigation himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed his unwavering support would shield her,never imagining that the erased footage might be restored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had underestimated Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,with the truth now laid bare, denial was futile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I&#39;m begging you, please believe me-l had no other option!&#34; Joyce implored, her hands concealing her tear-streaked face. Her voice quivered with desperation. &#34;Daniela knew about my feelings for you and took delight in tormenting me behind the scenes. She branded me a misfit brought in by a stepmother, and mocked me for aiming too high,thinking I could ever aspire to be with someone like you.It drove me to the brink, and in a moment of sheer rage, I lashed out. I had no idea Daniela would stoop so low as to record everything. Alexander, I swear,I was driven to the edge.&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze fell on Joyce, her cheeks glistening with a cascade of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his thoughts to himself, his voice low and steady. &#34;Now that you&#39;ve seen Daniela&#39;s true colors,be more vigilant. You&#39;re already under scrutiny. Don&#39;t  make things harder for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce watched his departing figure, her eyes narrowing, a frosty expression settling over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, what&#39;s happening?&#34; Katrina&#39;s voice broke through as she emerged from the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had the perfect strategy lined up, but Daniela came up with evidence. I totally underestimated her. Never mind-she&#39;s out of Alexander&#39;s world, and my path to success is just starting to clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced briefly towards the hospital room, then leaned closer to Katrina, lowering her voice. &#34;Mom,push Caiden to cut all ties with Daniela. Once he does,the Harper family will be within our reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Privately, Joyce never referred to Caiden as &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her strategy was clear: claim the Harper family&#39;s wealth while Daniela was sidelined, thus preventing any future entanglements should she return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she wielded control over the Harper family fortune, the Bennett family would overlook her modest origins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, securing a marriage with Alexander would be within reach. Katrina&#39;s smile held a hint of smug assurance.&#34;No need to worry. Caiden is fully wrapped around my finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The topic remained a hot issue online for over a week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, Harper Group had no choice but to enlist a third-party PR firm to handle the fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, merely an hour later, the controversy resurged, this time cementing its place in the public eye for a whole month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, overwhelmed and exhausted, closed his eyes and demanded of the PR team, &#34;What happened this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed these pesky trending topics simply refused to fade away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company staff responded with candid transparency, &#34;Mr. Bennett, previously it was a technical glitch. This time, someone has deliberately brought it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s frustration boiled over, his voice piercing as he barked, &#34;Who&#39;s behind it this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer came back clear and direct. &#34;My boss,  Cedric Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, the scandalous revelations about how Caiden had ousted his own daughter for a woman,and Alexander&#39;s affair with his wife&#39;s stepsister swept across the nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within days, the stocks of both the two groups nosedived to an all-time low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven to desperation, both families scoured for Daniela. Yet, she had disappeared, erased from the world as though she had never been part of it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell did she disappear to?&#34; Caiden bellowed, his voice thick with rage. Harper Group had endured catastrophic losses recently, unlike anything before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were bloodshot, a clear sign of his sleepless nights and boiling frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was dire. If things didn&#39;t turn around soon,he might have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Caiden cautiously, Joyce tried to soothe him. &#34;Dad, try to stay calm. Daniela has always been stubborn. You know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face flushed a deeper shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fit of fury, he sent Daniela a stern message, warning her that if she didn&#39;t address the chaos she&#39;d caused online within three days, he would take the drastic step of disowning her publicly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Alexander had taken matters into his own hands by hiring a private investigator to track down Daniela. Yet, after two agonizing weeks, there was still no word from the investigator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina reached out to a lawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the same day,Harper Group made a bombshell announcement that rocked the internet. Caiden, acting as the president, officially disowned Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Alexander, there was no familial bond with Daniela to sever, but the repercussions on the company&#39;s reputation were severe and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to the investigator, his voice low and filled with dissatisfaction. &#34;I&#39;ve handed you a fortune,and you&#39;re telling me you can&#39;t track down a defenseless woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The investigator was equally perplexed. &#34;Mr. Bennett,our team ranks among the finest in the nation. If she&#39;s eluding us, she&#39;s out of reach for anyone. But I must ask-are you certain she is merely an ordinary woman?Could she perhaps be concealing a more formidable persona beneath her unassuming exterior? How else could she vanish without a trace?&#34; With a deep sigh, Alexander squeezed his eyes shut,his mounting irritation finally breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was a woman everyone dismissed as a pathetic,lovesick fool. What secret could someone so pitiful possibly be hiding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the last decade, the most extreme thing Daniela had ever done was love him fervently. What other feats could she have accomplished?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it turned out Daniela did harbor some secret identity,he would swallow his arrogant claims whole. 8</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, should we consider engaging another private investigator?&#34; Alexander&#39;s secretary offered.&#34;It&#39;s been quite some time. Maybe something has happened to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioned by the panoramic window, Alexander surveyed the teeming city streets below, his expression detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. She&#39;s the one who wanted the divorce, so whatever mess she&#39;s in now is her own problem,not mine.&#34;</p>
