                <p>The scandal involving Joyce caused Alexander to lose several keý business deals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His divorce also drained a significant portion of his company&#39;s funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by these setbacks, he walked around his house in a silence filled with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, his plan was to secure some major contracts,then confess his feelings to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, with his finances depleting, he felt he could no longer delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remembered Daniela&#39;s distant manner in the living room, which sparked an unexplainable anxiety within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worried she might not wait for him or possibly fall  for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to ask her, &#34;Can you wait for me? I&#39;ll treat you well. I&#39;ll give you everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paced nervously in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Richard was about to speak, Alexander abruptly took the keys from the table and left without saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was aware that Alexander was on his way to see Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually hoped that Alexander and Daniela would come back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not, the investment he made in the robotics company would be locked up for a decade, a period during which he might not even be alive to reap the benefits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remained in the living room, his resolve unwavering, waiting for Alexander to come back with positive news.  Alexander was driving fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was on the balcony, her dress and hair fluttering wildly in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sat in a nearby chair, observing Daniela with an icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you previously assisted by holding back Joyce&#39;s dividends, so perhaps I owe you thanks. Yet,you are too adept, reminiscent of Brylee-calm,skilled in finance, just like your mother. Your mother and I were once close. I suggested subtly that she should leave Caiden, but her pride made her cling to him,leaving me no choice but to eliminate her. It was not my intention to end her life. She sealed her fate by choosing the wrong man. Now, here you are,repeating her errors. Why did you choose to divorce Alexander? Would it not have been simpler to remain with him? If you hadn&#39;t divorced him, he wouldn&#39;t have pursued Joyce, making her a citywide joke. But fret not, you will depart first, and soon after, I will deal with Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the clock, Katrina noted there was still  half an hour before Daniela would need to obey Johan&#39;s directive to jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to depart to establish an alibi. Offering Daniela a faint smile, she murmured, &#34;Goodbye,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, everything owned by Daniela would be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it wouldn&#39;t stop with Daniela. Alexander and eventually Caiden would also meet their ends at her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina chuckled softly as she prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Just then, a voice called out from below,startling her. &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Katrina hurried back to the edge of the balcony and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using a hypnotized person&#39;s name is a potent method to disrupt their trance.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, Katrina glanced back at Daniela,who  appeared still dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted to descend, but as she opened the rooftop door, Alexander was already ascending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing Katrina as well, Alexander bit back the words he was about to say to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, what are you doing on the rooftop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then looked towards Daniela, who had her back turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela?&#34; Alexander called again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of his voice, Daniela seemed to ease slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly moved to stand in front of her.He noticed clarity in her eyes momentarily, as if she were snapping out of a trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, he grabbed her arm and turned towards Katrina. &#34;What happened to Daniela?&#34; His voice carried a tone of suspicion, almost as if he were interrogating Katrina.  For a brief moment, Katrina&#39;s mind went blank. She worried she had accidentally revealed too much. She nervously clasped her hands together, her eyes darting around in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s scrutiny intensified, observing how Katrina avoided his gaze, her face reddening with apparent guilt. &#34;What were you doing just now?&#34; he demanded, his voice hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katrina felt overwhelmed, Alexander noticed Daniela&#39;s hand slip from his. He turned to Daniela.&#34;Were you feeling unwell just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;No, it&#39;s just the wind on the balcony is too strong. I&#39;m heading downstairs.&#34; With that, she left for the lower floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed on the balcony, his gaze intense and focused as he confronted Katrina. &#34;What were you really doing out here? Or more precisely, what were you doing to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina attempted a nervous laugh, her nose crinkling. &#34;What could I do? We were merely  chatting. Why won&#39;t you believe me? It&#39;s absurd to think I could harm Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Katrina turned and departed, her silhouette echoing despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained silent for a while, then moved closer to the balcony&#39;s edge amidst the gusting wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold wind swirled about him, nearly causing him to stagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steadied himself and peered down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa was five stories high, but the high ceilings made the drop seem closer to eight stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this perspective, all he could see was an abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted back to the vacant, distant look in Daniela&#39;s eyes, sending a shiver of dread through him.</p>
