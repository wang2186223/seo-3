                <p>The McCoy brothers rushed over the moment they saw Damon falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blurted out, &#34;Damon, what are you doing? Why are you throwing in the towel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen chimed in, &#34;Yeah, why give up now? We haven&#39;t even checked the dice. For all we know, Daniela could&#39;ve cheated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran nodded frantically. &#34;Damon, this isn&#39;t over. How can you give up so easily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stood there, crushed and defeated, murmuring in a daze,&#34;It&#39;s over. I&#39;ve already lost. She&#39;s Shim.How can she be Shim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, trying to smooth things over, forced a grin and clapped his hands. &#34;Alright, alright, everyone chill.Let&#39;s wrap this up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon clenched his jaw, refusing to let it end this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment while everyone was distracted, he darted forward and snatched the hammer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph caught the movement too late-there was no stopping him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp &#34;crack&#34; echoed through the room as the hammer came crashing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dice exploded into fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all that remained was a cloud of fine, colorless powder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell over the room like a blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, who had just been full of swagger, now stood stunned, disbelief twisting his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This can&#39;t be! No way Damon could lose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stood in shock, muttering like a broken record, &#34;Daniela must have cheated...&#34; Daniela crossed her arms and threw Nikolas a look dripping with sarcasm. &#34;This is the McCoy family&#39;s heir?Hamilton is betting on the wrong horse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face went ghost white at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost by instinct, his gaze lifted to the second-floor balcony. And like a ripple effect, every pair of eyes in the room followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in his life had Hamilton been dealt such a crushing blow to his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The forced smile on his face froze, his expression turning pale and rigid like cracked porcelain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shifted her gaze to the McCoy brothers, her voice steady. &#34;It&#39;s time to honor your word. Damon,you&#39;re done vying for the McCoy family&#39;s leadership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smirk danced on Daniela&#39;s lips as her eyes scanned the room. &#34;Now, who was it that said if I won,he&#39;d bark like a dog?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph flushed with unease and quickly stepped in.&#34;Ms. Harper, Mr. McCoy requests your presence upstairs for a private word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded coolly, &#34;He wants a word with me, yet thinks I should be the one going to him? What kind of twisted logic is that? I&#39;m standing right here. If he&#39;s got something to say, he can come and say it to my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s brows knit together, torn between duty and discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman was a storm he hadn&#39;t prepared for.Impossible to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his voice to a hush, he warned, &#34;This is Oiscoll. No one has ever dared to go against Mr. McCoy&#39;s will. You&#39;d be wise to go and see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh. &#34;Maybé no one used to challenge him. But now? Someone dares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph let out a long, weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he reached the second floor, Hamilton&#39;s face was a thundercloud of fury. Mr. McCoy, Daniela&#39;s not someone to underestimate. She&#39;s barely been in Oiscoll a few days and she&#39;s already shattered your sons&#39; dignity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton rose to his feet and began making his way down the stairs, his expression grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph paused, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. &#34;Mr. McCoy, are you really going downstairs to meet her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s stare turned glacial. &#34;Then you go bring her up-if you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph pressed his lips together,silently admitting defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Hamilton reached the bottom step, Duran had already been humiliated-reduced to barkig like a dog before the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy relatives struggled to hold back their laughter, hands barely muffling their snickers. Duran&#39;s face burned a furious red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; fists tightened at his sides, knuckles pale with fury. &#34;You&#39;ll regret this, Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to respond, she noticed Joseph approaching her with a smile. &#34;Ms. Harper, Mr.McCoy is downstairs waiting in the study. With so many people here and the McCoy family being so large, it would be best to discuss certain matters privately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped ahead without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Carol immediately fell in behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Joseph lifted his arm to bar their. way. &#34;Apologies, but Mr. McCoy wishes to speak with Ms.Harper alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t protest. Daniela, after all, feared no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, however, was not so calm. He spoke firmly without missing a beat. &#34;No. I&#39;m going in too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph gave a courteous smile, turning his attention to Daniela. &#34;Ms. Harper, Mr. McCoy wishes to speak on serious matters. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if those unrelated stepped aside?&#34; Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed, a cold glint forming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Joseph treated Cedric reflected how Hamilton saw Cedric&#39;s worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph daring to call Cedric &#34;unnecessary&#34; made one thing clear-he didn&#39;t see Cedric as a real heir to the McCoy legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also meant Hamilton himself hadn&#39;t truly accepted Cedric as his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had looked into it before. Hamilton had tried to find his illegitimate son, but it was clear he hadn&#39;t been genuine; there was probably a hidden motive behind his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, Daniela had held her tongue-only out of deference to the fact that Hamilton was Cedric&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it was clear that Hamilton didn&#39;t deserve her respect.</p>
