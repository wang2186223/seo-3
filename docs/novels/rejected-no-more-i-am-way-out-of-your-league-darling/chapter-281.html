                <p>Richard was completely taken aback. &#34;Enough with the underhanded comments. I&#39;ve put in money too, just as much as you! How is this debacle my fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, are you really in the dark?&#34; The mocking tone from the other end of the phone stung. &#34;Haven&#39;t you heard? It&#39;s your daughter-in-law, Joyce, who stirred up this hornet&#39;s nest. I&#39;ve done some digging. Joyce was desperate for cash to prop up her beau. Worried Joyce would squander it, Katrina had Daniela put a freeze on the dividends. Daniela felt the funds could serve a better purpose, so she channeled them into a new venture. Now, all that cash is tied up in research and development, which means dividends are off the table for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard absorbed every word. He understood them all individually, but pieced together, they were gibberish to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind whirled, torn between asking,′′Which man is Joyce supporting?&#34; and′′|sit certain there will be no dividends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice continued, &#34;Richard, it&#39;s the talk of Olisvine. Because of Joyce, there are no dividends. Joyce and Katrina are now public enemies. Tell your daughter-in-law to watch her back outside, or she might find herself in hot water!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speaker was Richard&#39;s old friend. Despite his attempt to moderate his tone, the words came out biting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To mess with someone&#39;s financial lifeline was to court disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This grudge was monumental.	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s first move was to call the robotics company, which confirmed the invested funds were locked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up and sat stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His retirement savings, accumulated from years of toil, were meant to secure a stress-free twilight.And now,because of Joyce,they were up in smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fierce rage burned within Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to call Alexander, the door clicked open and Joyce entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you show your face here?&#34; Richard leaped to his feet. &#34;Joyce, do you comprehend the chaos you&#39;ve caused? Because of you, the Bennett family is dragged through the mud. How can you just waltz in here? Are you tangled up with another man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t bring himself to say &#34;having an affair.&#34; He trusted Joyce hadn&#39;t strayed that far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before marrying Alexander, Joyce had been as headstrong about it as Daniela. Having achieved her goal,why would she stray?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was decent. Joyce, raised in the same home, should know better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce, disheveled, declared, &#34;Everything they say is true. I want a divorce from Alexander, and half of the Bennett family&#39;s assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard froze. A chill crawled up his spine. He stared at Joyce, his eyes wide with shock and dismay.&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m perfectly calm, and I mean every word,&#34; Joyce asserted, her lips pressed tight. Before arriving, she&#39;d talked to Milo. He wasn&#39;t after her money, but he was strapped for cash. If she couldn&#39;t help him, he&#39;d have to look elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she let the man she loved slip through her fingers? Milo was too precious; he was hers alone.Since she couldn&#39;t liquidate her shares in the robotics company, she&#39;d cash in her now meaningless marriage instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled herself on the sofa, channeling Daniela&#39;s usual composure, trying to think what her sister would do in such a scenario. Somehow, this brought her peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told Richard, &#34;The Bennett name carries weight, and Alexander cares about his image. I&#39;m still his wife.If I&#39;m shamed, it reflects poorly on him too, right?&#34; Richard trembled with anger at that. He realized he had overestimated Joyce&#39;s sense of propriety. He scoffed, &#34;So what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to have a falling-out with you. I&#39;ve given my all to this marriage, but Alexander has never truly accepted me. He&#39;s hinted at divorce before. I know he still pines for Daniela. I&#39;m ready to step aside. After the divorce, blame it all on me, and I&#39;Il bear it silently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was taken aback. He saw that when people lost all shame, they gained a cunning edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was so clear-headed,calculated and determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed Richard and said, &#34;But this divorce won&#39;t come cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard braced himself, knowing Joyce was about to lay down her terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want half of the Bennett family&#39;s assets, not a penny less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing half of the fortune would more than suffice to tide Milo over through his financial storm. Then,they could weave their future together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, trembling with fury, pointed a finger at Joyce, his tone icy and measured. &#34;You&#39;ve only been part of the Bennett family for a mere half a year. Aside from a trail of scandals, what value have you added? On what grounds do you stake a claim to our wealth? Joyce, if you have any conscience, you&#39;d initiate the divorce yourself, respecting the years you and Alexander have shared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce responded with a cold, humorless smile. &#34;I don&#39;t have any conscience. There&#39;s no thread binding Alexander and me. I am not as forgiving as Daniela. I lay claim to what&#39;s mine, and I will seize it.&#34;</p>
