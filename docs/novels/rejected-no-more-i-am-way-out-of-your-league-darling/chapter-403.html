                <p>Elyse knew what Linden wanted. It wasn&#39;t just about sending a few pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger boiled, her teeth grinding, but she understood the opportunity to eliminate Cedric was a rare one that couldn&#39;t slip by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a heavy silence, she called Natalie over and showed her the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nearly spat in disgust. &#34;What? Linden actually thinks he can sleep with me? When I was the most beautiful girl in school, adored by all the guys, Linden was hiding in the corner, too scared to even look my way! What&#39;s he thinking? He actually believes he can sleep with me? He&#39;s way out of his league! Someone needs to show him a mirror!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t hide her contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse snatched her phone back. &#34;I don&#39;t like him either, but right now, Linden is the only one who can get close to Cedric.He said the medical team is about to be reshuffled, and soon, we won&#39;t get such a good chance again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Natalie frowned, her voice sharp. &#34;So what are you saying, Mom? You want me to sleep with this disgusting man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse, of course, was reluctant. She had raised her daughter, stunningly beautiful and deserving of nothing but the best. &#34;So, what do you think we should do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s anger boiled, her mind a whirlwind. Just the thought of Linden-a repulsive rat no one wanted around-daring to think he could sleep with her made her sick to her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,she saw Nina nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In some ways, they were strikingly alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze turned cold and distant. &#34;Mom,I have an idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse didn&#39;t catch on right away, but when she did,she asked,&#34;Do you think it will work? Linden&#39;s wanted you for years. He&#39;ll recognize you instantly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie spoke in a detached tone. &#34;There are plenty of themed hotels these days with dim lighting. We can have Nina wear a silk scarf over her face. Since she and I share a similar look, Linden won&#39;t be able to tell us apart. Isn&#39;t the medical team about to be reorganized soon? Linden won&#39;t have time to figure it out.&#34; Elyse nodded,herexpression thoughtful.&#34;Alright,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Elyse went off to find Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was taken aback. &#34;Mom, what did yousay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood off to the side, her expression cold and uninterested, her voice calm and factual. &#34;Didn&#39;t you claim before that you&#39;d do anything to have Cedric?Now&#39;s the moment to prove it. Cedric is in critical condition, and the only one who can help him is Linden. But Linden made it clear-he won&#39;t treat Cedric unless you&#39;re willing to sleep with him first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s mind was a whirlwind, her voice quivering with uncertainty. &#34;I can&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse spoke, her tone soothing. &#34;Darling, why not? It&#39;s a small price to pay for something so important. Once you do this, Cedric will be forever grateful when he wakes up. You&#39;ll have made such a huge sacrifice for him-it&#39;ll win his heart, without a doubt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s thoughts spiraled in turmoil. &#34;But if I go through with this, Cedric will despise me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie scoffed. &#34;Nina, are you out of your mind? Why would Cedric despise you? You&#39;re doing this for him.It&#39;s just one time. Why are you making such a big deal?This kind of thing is common in our circle. You said you&#39;d do anything for Cedric, didn&#39;t you? So why are you backing out now?&#34; Tears streamed down Nina&#39;s face as she clung desperately to Elyse&#39;s hand. &#34;But Mom, I want to save myself for Cedric. I don&#39;t want to give myself to a stranger!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shook her hand off. &#34;Don&#39;t be so naive. This is your opportunity. Cedric never truly noticed you.You need to understand-this is your moment. If you don&#39;t take it, how else will you make him feel guilty enough to marry you? A small sacrifice now for a lifetime of wealth and security. What&#39;s the better choice here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood frozen, unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your time, but make up your mind in five minutes. If you can&#39;t go through with it, then forget it.Let Cedric die. It&#39;s not like it matters to us.&#34; With those cutting words, Natalie turned on her heel and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation had hit her like a storm, and Nina felt completely lost. She gazed helplessly at her mother,her face streaked with tears. &#34;Mom, is Linden really the only one who can save Cedric? Isn&#39;t there any other way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shook her head. &#34;There&#39;s no other option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s head hung low, and her lips trembled as tears streamed down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright!&#34; At last, she relented. She stood there, shaking, mustering every ounce of her strength to force out that one word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse smiled brightly, lavishing her with praise. &#34;I knew you were clever. Once Cedric wakes up, he&#39;ll owe you everything. You&#39;ll be able to proudly tell him that you sacrificed something precious to save him. He&#39;ll be grateful to you for the rest of his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina wasn&#39;t certain whether Cedric would feel thankful, but the idea made her feel sick to her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had guarded her innocence for so long, dreaming of giving herself to Cedric. But now, it was to be taken by a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head dropped, feeling heavy with despair. She even wanted to die.</p>
