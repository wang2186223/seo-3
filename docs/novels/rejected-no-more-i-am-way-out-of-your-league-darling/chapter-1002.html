                <p>&#34;If Nikolas makes the wrong choice, it could ruin his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words struck right at Hamilton&#39;s weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No father could bear watching his child&#39;s future unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Hamilton immediately said, &#34;Absolutely not. Carol and Nikolas aren&#39;t right for each other.I&#39;l speak with him soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped Brad. &#34;That&#39;s the right move. You definitely need to talk sense into him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the sofa, Hamilton gave Brad a pointed look. &#34;I&#39;m heading back to my place for a few days.You&#39;d better stay out of trouble while I&#39;m gone. I&#39;ll warn you-Cedric and Daniela are sharp. You can&#39;t match them.If you know what&#39;s good for you, pack up and go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words hung in the air as Hamilton strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Brad let his lips twist into a self-satisfied grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His moment of victory didn&#39;t last long. He felt an icy stare and snapped his head around,locking eyes with Carol-her gaze like a dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic made Brad tumble right off his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying all those things about Carol, being caught in her sights felt like instant justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dry gulp, he fumbled for the remote, switched off the TTV1and awkwardly hustled out of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his guest room, Brad called Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you make your move?&#34; Josh asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything went according to plan.&#34; &#34;No one caught on, did they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, Brad answered, &#34;Not a chance. Cedfic always assumes I&#39;ll tamper with the fruit. Instead,I slipped the poison right into Daniela&#39;s fruit bowl. It&#39;s a slow-acting dose-over the next ten days, her unborn children will be gone without a trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent work! We&#39;ll be waiting to celebrate when you deliver the news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jarvis laughed. &#34;You can count on me, Josh. Remember our deal: I get forty percent of McCoy Group&#39;s shares once this is done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a booming laugh. &#34;Rest assured, your share is safe with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of what lay ahead filled Brad with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night at dinner, he practically glided into the room, humming a tune, unable to keep the smile from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,meanwhile, lounged on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he crossed the room, Brad let his eyes wander over her rounded belly before he asked, &#34;Seven months along now, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother to look his way. Her voice was cold and even. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grin widened. &#34;Cedric really watches over you. I so much as touched the fridge where you store your fruit, and he tossed out everything inside-fruits, vegetables, the lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A derisive sound escaped Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression stayed unreadable when she was silent, but when she let her lips curl, there was something fierce about her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? From where I sit, it seems like someone&#39;s making life difficult for my husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that,Brad&#39;s eyelid gave a nervous twitch, picking up on the threat beneath her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He covered his nerves with boisterous laughter. &#34;Come now, what could possibly trouble anyone in your own house? If you ask me, Cedric&#39;s just too jumpy for his own good. No need to be alarmed, but I once knew someone who worried so much it drove him into a depression-he couldn&#39;t handle it, and in the end, he took his own life. If Ċedric keeps on like this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cut him off by lifting her head and leveling a cold, warning glare his way. The look she gave promised she was moments from picking up the ashtray and hurling it at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of fear slipped into Brad&#39;s voice as he asked, &#34;Why are you staring at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a trace of a smile remained on Daniela&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her smile, she radiated an intensity that made it hard for Brad to breathe. Even with twins on the way, her anger pressed down on him, suffocating. He tried to steady himself, but his hands trembled against his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a predator&#39;s focus, Daniela fixed her gaze &#39;on him and declared, &#34;This is my house. Cedric is my husband. Don&#39;t you dare speak against him in front of me. If you ever cross that line, I won&#39;t think twice about snapping your neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soccer match played in the background, filling the room with lively commentary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the ball hit the net, the stadium&#39;s roar exploded through the speakers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let her cold stare drift awayat last, leaving Brad standing stiff and silent, cold creeping through his limbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him a while to unclench his shaking hands and force his mind back into order.	D</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strained smile flickered across his face. &#34;No need to get so serious.I was just teasing, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela wasn&#39;t paying him any attention at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stung by the disregard, Brad slipped out of the room, shame burning in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the threshold, his eyes flashed with a mix of fury and wounded pride. Never before had anyone left him feeling so humiliated. Still, Brad felt no rush-he could indulge her arrogance for a little while longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, when blood poured from every.part of her and Cedric could do nothing but hold her as she slipped away, Brad wondered if Daniela would still wear that look of untouchable pride.</p>
