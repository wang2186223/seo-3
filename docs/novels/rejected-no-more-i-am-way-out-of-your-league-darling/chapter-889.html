                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;Suit yourself,&#34; she said, voice ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Hamilton had left, Nikolas slowly came to, blinking against the harsh light overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of regret washed over him as he turned to Daniela. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to drag you intoall this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a little laugh. &#34;Let&#39;s eat! It seems the princess isn&#39;tinterested in you. Is it about your appearance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance simmered in Nikolas as they exited the room. He leaned toward Carol, his tone barely above a whisper. &#34;Are you positive everything&#39;s really fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave him a pat on the back. &#34;Relax. There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had pointed out-when everything&#39;s hidden behind layers of secrecy, sometimes the only way to expose the truth was by pushing your opponent to make a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, if Daniela was wary of Hamilton, he wouldn&#39;t be so eager to eliminate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, Hamilton was scared of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Carol kept these thoughts to herself rather than explaining it all to Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d rather wait and see how things played out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton, seething with anger, wasted no time. He called for a board meeting, determined to use economic pressure to back Daniela into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the boardroom, the directors wasted no time airing their opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should&#39;ve taken care of Daniela ages ago. Maybe then she&#39;d respect the weight of McCoy Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! If we don&#39;t remind her who&#39;s in charge here, she&#39;ll start to forget her place in Oiscoll.&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t agree. We discussed sanctions before, but now her company is gaining ground. Taking action now will harm our own interests!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the hold-up? She&#39;s only one woman. It&#39;s absurd to think we&#39;re afraid of her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about being afraid. What&#39;s the point of picking a fight with her when she hasn&#39;t even made a move against us? If we start a financial war and lose, we&#39;ll just make ourselves a joke. Even if we win, it hardly seems worth the risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression hardened at that. He slammed his hand against the table. &#34;Are you actually suggesting McCoy Group could lose? You call yourself a leader? We&#39;re a powerhouse, top of the international market. Are you really telling me we should be worried about Daniela? That&#39;s nonsense. Spread talk like that, and you&#39;re the one everyone will mock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director faltered, voice barely above a whisper. &#34;But you can&#39;t deny how fast her company is catching up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot the director a hard look. &#34;Have you forgotten there is a blood feud between Daniela and every one of you? Do you honestly believe she&#39;ll just forgive and forget? Maybe you can dodge her now, but the moment she&#39;s strong enough to stand toe-to-toe with McCoy Group, she&#39;ll.come for every one of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force behind Hamilton&#39;s words lingered, making everyone shift uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some directors exchanged uneasy glances, uncertainty flickering in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the office door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas appeared in the doorway,eyes wide with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze ón Hamilton. &#34;Dad, what are you talking about? A blood feud? What is that? You told me it was all a misunderstanding. Are you telling me you had something to do with her mother&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s scowl deepened as his eyes landed on Nikolas. &#34;This isn&#39;t your place, Nikolas. Who let you in here?Leave.Now.&#34; Undeterred, Nikolas brushed past the secretary and faced Hamilton head-on. &#34;Dad, I need the truth. What is this history between Daniela and McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a harsh laugh. &#34;You think you&#39;re entitled to answers? You&#39;re nothing to this company anymore. McCoy Group&#39;s affairs don&#39;t concern you. Get out of my sight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary quickly motioned to security and leaned in close to Nikolas, her voice low. &#34;Please go. You can speak with Mr. McCoy once the meeting&#39;s finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With security guiding him out, Nikolas was removed from the boardroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed behind him, the directors&#39; whispers filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was Nikolas doing, barging in here out of nowhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Word is he&#39;s been spending time with Daniela lately. If he overheard all that, there&#39;s a good chance he&#39;ll tell her everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, but did you catch how shaken Nikolas was? He looked so rattled, you&#39;d think he belonged to the Harper family instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Daniela stormed into the club last night to get Nikolas out. Looks like those two have been sticking together for some time now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? If Daniela&#39;s already digging intó the past, it&#39;s only a matter of time before she uncovers everything. We need to act fast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what do you propose? Daniela&#39;s reach is growing by the day. McCoy Group might still be on top, but Daniela&#39;s company is gaining fast. Any sudden move from us could set off a financial disaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re out of options. So what exactly are we supposed to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy quiet settled over the boardroom once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone finally spoke up. &#34;If we try to go after her financially, we&#39;ll just end up hurting ourselves, too.Perhaps,we can find a scapegoat.&#34; That remark sparked a lively buzz around the table, unleashing a wave of fresh ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, a scapegoat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After all these years, could Daniela really dig up the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we hand over a scapegoat, Daniela might just let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that why Daniela even came to Oiscoll? Once she gets what she wants, she&#39;ll likely leave, and things can settle down again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds fine to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s irritation grew as he glanced around at the board members, all too intimidated by Daniela for his liking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Which one of you is volunteering to be the scapegoat?&#34; he asked.</p>
